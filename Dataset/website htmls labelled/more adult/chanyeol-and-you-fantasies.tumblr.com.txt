Exo Scenario - Meeting Chanyeol Backstage after a concert {Smut}
exo-k-m-reactions-blog:
Hello! I hope you enjoy this! This is my first scenario so bare with me ^-^ <3
If you have a request for me to do a scenario, fluffy or smutty, feel free to send it to me!
______________________________________________________________
You went to watch your boyfriend, Chanyeol and the group perform. You knew that he’d be home 3 hours after the show so you decided to stay and to surprise him and meet him backstage. You waited in their waiting room, for at least half hour before the group turns up and as per usual Chen, Baekhyun and Chanyeol were picking on Kyungsoo, once again. When Chanyeol turned around and saw you sitting there, he runs over to you, picks you up and you wrap your legs around his thin waist.
“I thought you were going to go home jagiya?” He asked surprised, squeezing you slightly. You answered while giggling, playing with his hair, “I wanted to surprise you.” “Yeah well, I’ll get you back,” Chanyeol said winking at you and Chen laughs because he heard him.
The other members went to go for food and Chanyeol and yourself stay behind, they usually take and hour and a half so he found this the perfect opportunity to get you back, he switched off the cameras that were in the room and made sure the door was locked. He put on the TV and you start watching watching a film, cuddling on one of the sofas. You thought that this was just going to be a peaceful, cuddling session until the others came back, but you were wrong.
Your paying full attention to the film when suddenly you feel his hand rise up to your thigh but you ignored it, he scoffed to himself quietly, smirking, knowing that you have no clue, not yet anyway. Then his hand slightly moves so it’s resting above your jean entrance, still you have no reaction. He carries on, undoes the button and lowers the zip, allowing on hand to slip through so it’s above your panties, that’s when you realized what was actually happening and before you opened your mouth to say something about what he was doing, his lips had locked to yours, lays you down on your back and plays about with you before breaking up the kiss and removing his hand. He smirks at you once again, but this time you can tell what it meant so you played dumb because you started to like where this was going.
Without any hesitation, he goes back in again for a kiss but this kiss was better than last time, passionate, slow and he teases you by biting your lips. While doing so, he lowers your jeans and takes them off you, leaving you with just your top, bra and panties still on. The kiss is broke once again for you to take off his shirt which then he takes off yours, going back for the kiss and he starts cupping your breasts, lifting you up so your sitting on his lap, facing him so he could unhook your bra, then going back to playing with your nipple as you let out slight moans.
He stands up, you still wrapped around him and puts you on the table, then basically ripping your panties off you, sticks one of his long fingers in, then the 2nd, making you squirm and moan, a few times going in for a taste while still playing with his fingers. You tap him on the head, hinting him to stop and to tell him it’s your turn to give pleasure, you get down on your knees infront of him, first lowering his trousers, then his boxers, his dick popping at you, you start sucking. Letting out moans, he grabs your hair gently and slightly thrusts, making you gag a little.
He pulls away and lays you back down onto the sofa, places himself onto of you so his dick is hovering over your entrance, kissing you, making you to want him to just got on with it, he could tell you were getting frustrated with him because he’s making you wait and he laughs to himself, moving his lips off yours, “Someone getting frustrated?” he teases.
“Fuck you, stop playing about Chanboob!” You tell him, giggling to youself.
Before you knew it, he enters, both of you moaning uncontrollably but trying to keep quiet just incase the staff members heard. You bite your lip, trying to fight back you moaning his name but you couldn’t help and using your nails to mark property on his back, “Oh…..Chanyeol.” You let out, him moaning your name aswell, both of you biting each other’s neck, both receiving hickeys.
He finally finds your spot and your breathing caught up with his, both panting fast, unable to hold back anything.
“Y/N, I fucking love you!” He moans, finishing off, moving himself so he’s spooning you, both heartbeats are racing.
You turn your head around to kiss him gently, “I love you too, now lets get dressed, clean up our mess and get rid of anything that could make them suspicious.” You said, pushing yourself away from him, leaving him laughing to himself.
“Yeah, good idea” He agrees,  when suddenly you hear Baekhyun’s voice, “You better not have done what we think you’ve done!” he said teasingly but also seriously at the same time.

I Can Love You Better…
Chanyeol Smut
allthingssmuttykpop:
You were angry. In fact, you were fuming. There he was, the guy who was your one and only, clearly did not see you that way as well as he was currently sat at the window seat booth of your favourite restaurant, where he used to bring you, with a super skinny blonde girl holding hands and sharing a glass of wine and a meal. ‘I should have known’, you thought.
He told you he was going out with a few friends for some drinks and so you decided to do a bit of shopping to pass the evening away. After finishing your shopping trip, feeling exhilarated and excited to show him your sexy new dress you had bought, concealing it under your trench coat, now you were stood in the porch of the little café across the street burning holes with your eyes into his skull. How could he?
You acted on impulse, striding up to the window and knocking on it. When the pair of them looked up at you, a look of shock took over his face but you did not care for him, or her right now, you just needed to get away. You mouthed an ‘It’s over’ to him through the glass and turned and got into the first taxi cab that came.
Once you arrived back to your apartment, you packed some clothes and essentials into a suitcase, grabbed the keys to your car and drove to your parent’s old cabin in the woods a little way out of town. He did not know about this cabin which is why you thought it would be the best place to stay to clear your head. He never wanted to talk about you, only himself.
It took about half an hour before you turned up the dirt path that led towards the side of the mountain, towards the cabin, and then a further couple of minutes until you were deep in the forest.
You reached the gate and rummaged around in your purse for your key before leaving the warmth and safety of your car and rushing to the gate, sliding the key into the lock, your hands shaking from anger and the cold. You parked your car outside of the front steps, grabbed your suitcase from the backseat and hauled it inside slamming the door shut behind you. You dragged the case and your bag into the main bedroom and pushed it against the wall next to the oak door, your anger dissipating when you glanced around the room and the familiar setting, breathing in the scent of pine and fresh air. You never truly realised how much you missed the cabin until now.
Bending down to put some logs into the fire and lighting it with a match, you unfastened the belt from your coat to let the warmth from the fire touch your cold skin, immediately relaxing you when you were warmed from head to toe. You could tell your parents had not been here in a while as there were still many logs for the fire and the whiskey decanter had not been touched! You contemplated whether you wanted to drink in your current state as it was supposedly a depressant; you didn’t need to be more depressed! You decided on a pouring yourself a single whiskey as to not drink your feelings away. Once the liquid reached past your lips and down your throat, it was warm and strong like the fire but did not burn like you remembered it used too. You sunk down into the chair by the fire and began to relax until you heard a howl in the distance. Your eyes shot open, there couldn’t be wolves around, could there?
“I don’t remember my parents telling me anything about wolves before” you muttered to yourself as your strode over to the window, glancing cautiously at the dark trees that were concealing everything that lie beyond. You shook your head, thinking you had probably imagined the noise, and walked to the bedroom to check your phone. As expected, multiple messages from your ex saying he was ‘sorry’ and that ‘it wasn’t what it looked like’.
“Pfft, as if you can fool me with that” you mumbled distastefully, your anger rising in you again but this time it was accompanied by something else. Sadness. You wondered how he could do this and how he could feel no guilt for his actions. A single tear rolled down your cheek which you quickly swiped away. Fastening your coat and downing the rest of the whiskey, you rushed out of the door and into the forest. You knew this mountain like the back of your hand so you knew you would not get lost, but you could not shake the feeling that in the dark, something or someone was watching you. The forest was chilling at night. Each bend you turned in the path, you expected to be greeted by some machete wielding axe murderer from the horror movies or a dangerous animal, but nothing was there. You were all alone.
You came upon a clearing in which a tree stump sat peacefully in the centre. You ran to it, sat down clutching your face in your hands and began to cry. The tears did not stop falling as you wept alone in the forest, not noticing the crunching of branches from behind you over your cries. You heard a thud from behind you and instantly stopped crying and sat up silently. You didn’t want to know what was behind you, as you stood wearily and turning slowly on the spot. You gasped at the great, black furred wolf stood on the other side of the tree stump. You were frozen, you didn’t dare move as the wolf bounded towards the stump and leapt onto it with ease, staring at you with its bright blue eyes and pacing on the tree stump. You backed away as slowly as you could, the wolf’s eyes boring into yours, your heart caught in your throat and beating so loud you thought the wolf could hear it. ‘The cabin is just beyond the trees, I can make it there before the wolf’ you thought, gulping down the flood of saliva in your mouth. You heaved a deep breath, rotated on your heel and ran. Ran as fast as you could the way you came, not daring to look behind you at the source of the snarls and growls.
You slammed the door shut and thrust the key into the lock, sighing in relief as you walked backwards to find the table eyes fixed on the backdoor. However, you did not hit the table on your trek backwards, your back was met with a solid chest and your body was cast in a shadow towering over you.
You spun around and were met with a pair of bright blue eyes attached to a tall, brown haired man. Not a wolf. These were the wolf’s eyes though, you had stared at them for so long you could not shake the image from your head. He stared at your petrified frame, and laughed in a deep resonating voice, stalking towards you as the wolf had. As he took a step forward, you took one back until you hit the door, desperately trying to unlock it fast enough but you were met with no success. He pinned you to the door, a hand on your lower back to press you against it as the other snaked its way across your cheek, stroking it in a loving manner, something your ex never did. You wanted to say something to stop him, but you choked on your words, enjoying the feeling this stranger’s hands felt against you.
“You-You’re the wolf” you cried.
“It’s ok, I’m not going to hurt you, unless of course…you’d like me to” he whispered in your ear, licking a wet stripe up the side of your neck before spinning you around to face him. As you looked up at your captor, his eyes were on the floor as he frowned at it, anger stretching across his face causing him to tighten his grip on you and you to wince at the pressure of it.
“I’m so sorry” he said as he loosened his grip “I just-I can’t believe he cheated on you, that motherfucker!” he growled letting you go and slamming his hand against the adjacent wall, startling you.
“How-how do you know about that?” you uttered almost inaudibly but he caught your words and looked up at you, a saddened and angry look in his eyes.
“I-I’ve been following you for a while, keeping an eye on you. I used to see you come up here with your family when you were 10. I was only a teenager but I knew from the second I saw you, that you were the one” he sighed averting his eyes, highly expecting your reaction to be bad. But you were not creeped out, you felt warm and giggled at the thought. He glanced at you in concern.
“What’s so funny?” he asked. You chuckled some more, blushing as he stared at you further.
“You loved me all that time, and you didn’t talk to me or come to meet me?” you smiled at him, admiring the way his smile lit up his face.
“I love you (Y/N), and I always wanted to make you mine but that-that fool got in the way, but I kept my distance, watching for any slip up he might make and tonight he made a gargantuan mistake and he lost you” he smiled wickedly at his words and turned his gaze to you. He walked briskly over to you and slid his arm around your waist and cupped your face, placing his forehead against yours.
“(Y/N), let me show you how much I love you. Let me prove where that prick did not deserve to be. Let me prove myself” he put extra emphasis on the word ‘prick’ and you understood what he intended to do.
“What’s your name?” you asked wrapping your arms around his neck and leaning into him and biting his earlobe.
“Chanyeol” he groaned as you licked at the spot behind his ear.
“Ah, Chanyeol, at least I know what to moan now” you uttered in his ear. You knew you were poking the wasps nest by teasing a wolf but you wanted him all the same, a sudden change in demeanour to one of love and lust. You had read about werewolves everywhere but nothing could have prepared you for him.
He grabbed your hair and yanked your head back, exposing your neck to him. Using his long, pointed tongue he licked from the base of your neck over your chin and connected his lips with yours. As his tongue began to explore your mouth, you could feel his teeth had become sharper and were now pointed like fangs. You gasped as he bit your lip, blood beading on your skin before he licked the beads away, swiping his tongue back into your mouth, accompanied now with a metallic taste.
“I could just eat you up” he growled, hooking your legs around his waist as he carried you to the bedroom. He laid you gently back onto the bed and stood at the foot of it to remove his shirt and jeans before crawling towards you.
“Chanyeol, can you help me with my dress?” you questioned innocently, pulling slightly on the zipper at the front of the dress, exposing your lacy bra to him, leaving so much more to the imagination. His eyes began to glow an even brighter blue as he came to hover over you, teeth and claws bared, as he pulled the zipper slowly down your body, watching in amazement as the fabric parted to reveal your lace clad body. He lifted you carefully and pulled the dress from beneath you, connecting his lips to yours as his hands wormed their way around your back. With a flick of his fingers your bra was off and his fingers began to knead your breasts, rolling your erect buds between his index finger and thumb. He caught your moan with his mouth attached to yours and he carefully began to drag his claws over your other breast and down your body, sending chills up your spine. Once he reached your panties, he swiped his claws quickly across the fabric, ripping them in half and throwing the remnants to the floor.
“You won’t be needing those” he grinned cheekily as he took his own underwear off and pressed the head of his member at your entrance.
“Are you ready?” he asked timidly, eyes staring into your soul. You nodded and clutched onto his biceps for dear life as you saw what was about to enter you. To clarify, he was a lot bigger than your ex. He pushed slowly inside of you, groaning at the wet, tight warmth that greeted him and his eyes began to loll at the sensation. You moaned out loud, signalling for him to move faster, but you could not shake the thought of how it would feel if he lost control of his wolf. You had decided. You were going to tease the wolf out of him.
“Chanyeol, faster, please” you whimpered at his excruciatingly slow thrusts. You cupped his face in your hands and kissed him passionately.
“Chanyeol, it’s ok to lose control, I want it please” you begged, widening your eyes at his almost painful expression.
“(Y/N), you don’t understand, I’m dangerous when I lose control, you don’t want that” he gritted his teeth and ceased all movement inside of you, making you groan in frustration.
“Chanyeol, I trust you, so I trust him. Plus, how can I experience what my ex wasn’t giving me if you don’t give me the whole package?” you bit your lip and awaited his answer. Little did you know, that was all it took to break the camel’s back. The wolf was out. His eyes glowed a bright blue, almost white, at the mention of your ex and he snarled before thrusting with all his might into you, pounding you into oblivion.
It was like nothing you had ever had before, he was reaching deeper and deeper into you with each thrust and before long he was striking your g-spot. You gasped and writhed at the pleasure filled chills it sent through you and you felt your orgasm quickly approaching. You could feel him twitching inside of you as he gripped the headboard for support, thrusting even deeper inside you, making you scream his name over and over again.
“Chanyeol, oh my, Chanyeol I-I” you could not even finish your sentence for you were right on the brink of orgasm.
“I know baby, I can feel it. Scream to the world, who is giving you this pleasurable feeling?” he snarled. You didn’t answer, just moaned.
“Is it your ex?” he asked, clamping his hand around your neck, not cutting off your air supply, but holding it hard enough for you to understand his point. You shook your head, but he wanted you to say his name.
“I can’t hear you baby” a feral noise rumbled from within him and resonated through you as words finally entered your mouth and you were able to speak.
“You Chanyeol, only you, he could never make me feel this good” you gasped as he pounded harder into you, forcing you over the edge as you both climaxed and rode out your orgasms. He pulled out of you, the smell of sweat and sex in the air. You cuddled into his chest, breathe still burdensome as you came down from your high.
“That was remarkable” he smiled down at you “I love (Y/N), will you be mine?” he asked, pure love in his eyes.
“Of course I will” you giggled as you curled further into his chest and stayed up all night talking with him.

Set The Mood
iskpoptrash:
Group: EXO
Member: Chanyeol
Type: Smut (requested)
Warnings: Smut / Multiple Orgasms / Overstimulation
_______________________________________
If there was one thing Chanyeol was good at, it was setting the mood for your date nights. He made them as sensual and romantic as possible. Candles of your favorite scents and colors were scattered around the room casting it in a warm glow. The curtains were closed. The tv was off. The bed looked oh so inviting. And he took pride in his ability, sometimes getting cocky by jokingly putting out rose pedals.
“Go ahead. Pick some music,” he whispered against my neck as he slipped my coat from my arms.
I walked over to the stereo in the corner and picked up Chanyeol’s phone. His music was so chaotic that I found myself overwhelmed with the variety. Immediately my eyes settled on an album that I knew would be perfect. There was a moment of silence as Beauty Behind the Madness started up on shuffle and I made my way back over to the bed. The beginning of “Acquainted” sounded as I sat down on the edge of the bed, watching Chanyeol return from the closet, his eyes clouded with lust. His nimble fingers raised a path of goosebumps up my legs as they trailed up over my skirt and gripped the hem, pulling it off. My shirt was the next to go, coming off in a swift tug. His eyebrow quirked at the sight of my lack of a bra before he slipped out of his button-up, letting it slip off of his arms and onto the floor.
Heat was formed at our lips like the strike of a match as they met in long passionate kisses. His hands cupped my face as mine worked on the buckle of his belt, moving to unbutton his jeans once the leather was out of the way. When he stepped out of them his knee was in between my legs, moving me farther up on the bed. He hovered over me, pushing my back against the mattress. His lips dominated mine, as his clothed arousal rubbed against my heat, causing low moans to fall out of me like a whisper.
“You like that?” he asked, rocking his hips harder into mine. When I responded with a hiss as he touched my clit through my underwear he chuckled, “I have so much I want to do to you.”
His teeth nibbled the shell of my ear as his fingers gripped my hip, pulling me closer to him which I didn’t think was possible.
“Like what?” I asked, my chest pumping faster with every breath.
“Well, first, I’m going to eat you out. Second, I’m going to fuck you so hard you won’t be able to walk. And then I want you to ride me until you’re numb,” he spoke matter-of-factly, an air of arrogance to him.
Staying true to his words, he kissed a path from my neck over my chest and down to my stomach. His eyes glanced up at me before he hooked his fingers into the waistband of my underwear and slipped them off my legs. My legs lifted from the mattress to let his hands settle under my thighs as his lips moved closer and closer to my heat. It started off as a subtle lick and then it turned into gentle laps at the folds. He moaned against me, tasting how aroused I was for him. The vibrations made my back arch slightly off of the mattress. I could practically feel his smirk as he returned to licking my clit, circling it with his tongue before subtly pulling at it with his lips. With my moans fueling him, he buried himself further into my folds, his tongue running up and down the slit from my entrance to my clit and back again. I hadn’t realized it but my hands were now tangled in his hair, threaded in the soft locks. Chanyeol looked up at me with a smirk on his face, looking cockily satisfied before he went back to work on bringing me to my climax which seemed to be getting closer.
“Go ahead baby, cum for oppa,” he spoke smoothly as he slipped his fingers into me to finish me off. With a few curls and pumps of his fingers I came undone, a broken moan leaving my lips. My legs shook slightly from the sensation of his fingers as they continued their assault on me even though my high had already passed. I finally had to pull him out of me, my breath coming out in ragged spurts.
“Give me a second,” I sighed, watching through half-lidded eyes as he stuck his fingers in his mouth and pulled them back out with a wet pop.
“Okay, but I’m definitely not finished with you,” he replied, reaching over to the bedside table to get a condom out of the drawer. He pulled out two and left one on the table top. He was serious about this. And I wasn’t sure if I could last two more times.
Next thing I knew the song switched to the well-known “Earned It”, and the condom was rolled onto his now very erect member as he gripped my waist and pressed a kiss to my cheek, “Are you ready?”
I nodded hesitantly and braced for the familiar feeling of him inside of me, hissing when he was half in. He pulled my attention back to him by taking back control of my lips with his as he continued to push himself further. His hands roamed over my thighs, hooking them up around his waist to make it easier when he thrusted into me. His dark eyes seemed hazy yet determined as he stared into mine. One hand held my thigh up for leverage while the other cupped my face as he peppered hot kisses all over my face.
“Cause, girl, you’re perfect. You’re always worth it, and you deserve it. The way you work it,” he sang quietly in my ear like a lullaby, “Cause, girl, you earned it. Girl, you earned it.”
And, God, was there nothing sexier than Chanyeol singing huskily in English.
It was a wonder how I heard him over my ragged breaths and low groans as he thrusted faster and harder. He smirked when my nails reached up and grazed his back, my climax on the brink. When the song was coming towards an end I realized that he was timing his thrusts with the bass of the music. They were slowing down yet still powerful enough to draw me towards release.
My lip was practically purple as I bit down in it to muffle the loud moans that were sure to wake the neighbors. Chanyeol, noticing my dilemma, took my lip from my teeth and pressed his lips to mine, allowing me to moan as freely as I wanted into him. My fingers gripped his shoulders as I felt myself cum. He took the opportunity to cum as well, his hips shuttering against mine. The song switched from “Earned It” to “The Hills”, one of my favorite songs.
As our highs winded down, he lazily sucked love bites into my throat. Once he grew bored with that he got up to throw the soiled condom and retrieved the new one, rolling it onto him. I lied there trying to regain control of my breath. He hovered back over me, this time with only playful kisses on my chest and neck. His lips made their way up to mine, making passion-filled promises. Lost in the whim that was Chanyeol’s lips and the loud melody floating from the corner, I barely registered our sudden flipped positions. My hips rested on top of his, his hands holding my thighs close around his.
“Go ahead, baby,” he cooed in my ear with a kiss to my cheek, giving the back of my thigh a light squeeze.
I sat up straight, taking a hold of his erection as I lowered myself onto it. My lip was caught between my teeth again as I readjusted to him. The music fueled me to loosen up my hips, moving them along to the melody. Chanyeol’s fingers bruised my waist as he used them like handles, holding on for the ride. My hands held onto his stomach as I grinned down on him, feeling him hit every spot inside of me.
Chanyeol’s facial expressions and moans as his head hit the pillow encouraged me to lean down and add to his pleasure by sucking love bites on his collarbones. It surprised me when his hands fisted tufts of my hair and pulled my lips to his. A low growl could be heard from his throat as he started thrusting up into me, meeting my movements. Once again, he followed the music, thrusting in time with the beat. Not that I minded, the music was perfect for stuff like this. It made the mood even sexier.
“Fuck me like you mean it, _______,” he whispered into my ear, pecking kisses down the side of my neck to my shoulder.
So I moved my hips in ways that I didn’t know I could move them. My hair fell around my face in somewhat of a mess and my lips were bruised from the clashes of kisses and teeth. My nails practically raked across his chest as I felt my release once again getting closer. I could feel him too, his movements getting sloppy as his climax drew near.
He came first, his hips moving faster and harder at the last minute to ride out his high, bringing me to come undone. My arms grew weak from holding me up over his chest, slightly shaking. Chanyeol noticed this and pulled me down to lie on his chest, his chin resting on top of my head.
“I’ll go start up a bath for us,” he kissed my forehead before gently laying me on my side.
Lying there, I could hear the water running. My face lit up at the sound of the bubble bath bottle being popped open. I sat up and put my feet on the floor but when I tried to stand my hips felt sore. When Chanyeol returned he chuckled seeing me in such a state, sitting on the edge of the bed.
“Damn, I’m good,” he snickered to himself.
“Just help me.”
“Sure thing,” he walked over to my side and slung my arm around his shoulders, picking me up bridal style. As we made it through the threshold into the bathroom he asked with a grin, “Ready for another round?”
I rolled my eyes and playfully hit his chest, “No! Get me into the bathtub.”

First Love
kpoppsluff:
Request: http://kpoppsluff.tumblr.com/post/131624592004/a-chanyeol-sluff-where-he-catches-you-dancing-to
~~~
“Ugh i’m so bored!” I pouted throwing myself on the lounge couch. I reached for my phone that was on the coffee table and looked at the screen saver; It was Chanyeol and I at the KBS Music Festival. It was such an amazing night and I was truly grateful that his company was okay with us making our relationship public.
I unlocked my phone and scrolled through my instagram feed. I scrolled down looking at pointless photos until I came across Chanyeol’s picture. He was in the dance room showing off one of his cute smile. I scrolled down a little to read the caption.
“I miss you <3”
I giggled at his caption double tapping the picture. I pressed the home button and went to my music.
“First Love?” I questioned to myself I pressed play and the speakers started playing in the living room.
“First Love it is.” I said lifting myself off to the couch.
Oh oh oh oh (cheossarangui bimil ilgi) ah-yeah
I started humming to the music walking into the master bedroom to wear something more comfortable. I grabbed one of Chanyeol’s oversized T-shirt with knee high socks. I walked into the bathroom to brush my teeth, wash my face and tie my hair into a loose ponytail.
I walked out of the room and walked back to the living room.
naui maeumi (hayahge) nae du ppyami (balgahge)
majuchin nuni (kkamahge) nae haneuri (norahge)
Since I had nothing better to do I decided to be a goof ball and dance to the song. I started to move your hips feeling the music dancing with you. I felt free didn’t care that the neighbors could hear my music, or somebody watching me.
hayan jongie jogeumssik geuryeo naman bol su issge mollae boyeojwo
geureohge maeil Crazy neowa hamkke hagessji kkumeul kkuji baby
Once it reached Chanyeol’s rap the music stopped.
“Ahh what the hell?” I shouted turning around stopping dead in my tracks as my eyes met Chanyeol’s who was
just sitting on the couch checking you out up and down
licking his lips seductively. I could feel my cheeks turning red from embarrassment.
“I thought you hated that song.” His low, sexy voice said.
“Well I was bored and” I said letting my sentence trail off.
“And?” He asked getting up from the couch walking towards me.
“And I wanted to be free I guess.” I said grabbing on to his index fingers.
“So you wanted to be free?” He asked sounding little bit more lascivious on free. I raised my eyebrow a little at him. Chanyeol slowly intertwined his hands with yours and started lightly kissing your neck.
“No not tonight; you must be exhausted.” I said trying to break the intimate moment.
“Nope I’m perfectly fine jagiya.” He said looking into my eyes.
I smirked at him and stood on the tip of my toes and crashed my lips into his. It was always challenging whenever Chanyeol and I had moments like this since he’s literally Jolly Green Giant compared to me.
Chanyeol laughed in the kiss noticing my struggle. He lifted me up and moved my legs around his torso. I leaned forward tugging on his lips having my hands on his chest. He removed his hands off my waist and grabbed and cupped my cheeks and kissed me roughly.
I forcefully pushed Chanyeol causing him to lose his balance and falling on the couch. I gave him an evil smirk letting him know that I’m in control for the night.
“So you like peeping on me?” I seductively said whispering on him grinding on him. Chanyeol sharply sucked in some air roughly grabbing on my butt.
sorido eopsi seumyeodeureowa josimseure neon jeomjeom beonjyeowa
neoro inhae alge doen modeun ge areumdawo
After getting little of bored of whispering seductive things in his ear and him just giving me moans in return. I got off his lap and went on the floor positioning myself right in front of his legs.
“You never answered my question oppa.” I said slowly rubbing his thighs giving him an innocent look.
“Ahh jagiya y-yes- I- I mean n-no” Chanyeol muttered placing his hands behind his head.
I carefully unzipped his jeans also grabbing onto his boxers letting his erection spring free. I stared at it in awe still amazed how big he is.
I wrapped my small hands around his shaft starting to pump it. I can hear Chanyeol taking deep breaths in closing his eyes. While I still had the upper hand I quickly shoved my him inside my mouth.
I looked up and saw Chanyeol’s dark eyes look at me lustfully. I purposely flicked my tongue on the tip of his head causing him to fling his head back moaning.
I started bobbing my head up and down while my hands still continued the same up and down motion on the lower part of his erection.
From time to time I would attempt to go deeper, but of course my gag reflexes decided against that, so I just stuck with simple tongue flicking.
“I-I’m close.” I heard him whisper, so I decided to go faster making Chanyeol grip on my hair a little and moving his hip up and down.
After a few flicks his finally released his hot seeds into my mouth thanking god it tasted sweet.
I opened my mouth and got myself cleaned up a little then I climbed back on top of his hips.
“wanna take it the bedroom?” I whispered. Chanyeol growled into my ear and pushed me down on the couch and went from there.
Let’s just say I wasn’t able to walk properly the next day.

Come Over (Chanyeol) [Smut]
pabosontheloose:
“Hey, my parents are gone. Come over now, I’m bored.” Chanyeol whined over the phone. His parents were planning to go to the Bahamas for two weeks and they just left an hour ago. I laughed.
“I’m kind of hurt you only want me over because you’re bored, Yeol. I’m not a clown. Call Baekhyun or something.” I replied. There was more whining after I said that.
“Baekhyun’s with his girlfriend, I don’t want to be third wheeled. Besides, you’re more fun to play with. Pleaseee??”
“I can’t, Chan. I need to study for the finals on Friday. Build a cup tower or something. I’ll talk to you later okay?” I suggested before hanging up and going to change. I am going over his house, he’s been telling me he wanted bubble tea for the past week, so why not surprise him? Once dressed, I went downstairs to pull on my shoes before leaving to the nearest shop.
Two bubble teas were bought before I walked over to his house. Obviously having been here more times than I care to remember, I took the key hidden in his mailbox and went straight in, trying my best not to make a sound because I wanted to scare him. When Chanyeol is scared, he will jump like a bunny. It’s the cutest. When I saw the living room, the coffee able was littered with plastic cups, telling me he really did try to make a tower of cups. Giggling a little, I gently placed the two cups on the table, I tip-toed up the stairs but slowed down when noises were heard.
What is he doing? Does he have someone over? It sounds like he’s hurt…Once I reached the top of the stairs, his bedroom door was slightly opened, allowing me to peak through. The sight that I saw was tempting once I looked. The boy was shirtless with one hand under the blanket that was covering half of his body. It was obvious he was pumping himself when his head was thrown back in satisfaction. His Adam’s apple bobbed up and down, causing me to swallow.
“(Y-Y/N)…” his low voice moaned out, causing my eyes to widen but my lips to curl into a smirk. I can’t lie and say that I don’t enjoy this, after all, I’ve liked Chanyeol since forever, but this caused me to feel a little hot. He was pleasuring himself thinking about me. I opened the door more to let myself in before leaning against the wall, arms crossed, watching him writhe on his own bed.
It was until I felt my panties getting wet that I finally spoke. “Huh, I came over to surprise you but instead, you surprised me, Chanyeolie.” With that, his eyes snapped open, looking at me from across the room, hand movement slowing down and jumping straight up like I thought he would	“(Y/N)!” he exclaimed, trying to hide the red showing on his face. I walked closer towards him.
“What? You were moaning the name a while ago, why did you stop?” I questioned before dipping my head down to connect our lips together into a deep kiss. He didn’t hesitate to grab my waist and pull me down so I was straddling his waist, deepening the kiss. When we pulled away because of the lack of air, one of his hands flew to the hem of my shirt, lifting it up and off of me before flinging it away.
Another moment later, his lips were on mine again and he flipped us so he was on top. The blanket was swiftly removed from between us and my face flushed after seeing the sight of his erect member. Fingers were starting to unbutton and remove my shorts before I helped him slip it off. It was then his turn to smirk at me in my pink bunny bra and underwear.
His right hand slipped under the bra and started massaging one breast while the other hand went to my back to unclip the piece of clothing once that was off, he latched his mouth onto the other nipple, sucking and lightly biting while I began heavily breathing. My back was slowly arching as his tongue flicked the nipple repeatedly.
One hand then started slithering towards my underwear and tugged at it until it was kicked off. The cold air caused me to close my legs but he prevented that by placing himself between.
“Before I take you to heaven, you need to know that I’ve liked you for a long time now.” he whispered in my ear causing me to smile.
“I like you too, Chanyeol.” I replied, I almost didn’t get to finish the sentence when he pushed himself in. Both of us moaned out at the feeling.  My hands gripped his arms that were on either side of me. The pain started to subside and pleasure kicked in before I wanted him to move. He got the message with the nod of my head and started to thrust. His head leaned down to start kissing and sucking on my neck, leaving various purple spots for me to worry about tomorrow.
“C-Chanyeol…please..go faster..” I moaned out as he went faster. My head was thrown back like his was earlier. There was a thin layer of sweat on us as the room started to get hotter. His thrusts got deeper as he took hold of my hips.
“I’m going to…Chanyeol, I’m about to…” I breathed out, he nodded, coming to take me into another kiss and giving one last hard thrust, causing us to moan into each other as I came first and he right after. It’s a good thing I’m on the pill otherwise I would’ve yelled at him. Our breathing was heavy and irregular as he put his weight on me, pulling his member out along the way.
“You know, I got you bubble tea downstairs.” The words were able to form after a few minutes of breathing. He turned his head to look at me before planting a kiss on my temple.
“That sounds tempting, but we need to clean up first.” he mumbled, his voice somehow coming out deeper than before. Then, he got up, hoisting me over his shoulder and walking towards the bathroom and locking it.
———————–

‘Angel’
pxnexo:
Chanyeol x Reader
Request: “Chanyeol would be the type to make you breakfast after lovemaking. You should write something about that.”
Word Count: 1,696
Rated: SMUT
You were walking along the beach with your boyfriend of two years, hand in hand, conversation flowing just like the waves -beautiful and constant- and you loved it. This was one reason you really loved him. The conversation never stopped, never dulled. He always had something to talk about, and loved sharing. He listened just as intently as he spoke, too. You felt loved, and like he was honestly interested in everything you said.
Eventually you made it to a beautiful two story beach house, heading for the shower. You were both covered in sand from your day at the beach and were desperate to get the sand out of the areas it really shouldn’t be. Honestly you weren’t sure how it got there in the first place. You got in the shower first, rinsing your sand and salt caked body and washing your hair. After finishing, you grabbed a towel and dried off, calling Chanyeol to tell him he could get in.
He shut off the shower minutes later and dried himself, wrapping the towel around his hips and exiting the bathroom. The sight he saw upon exiting send a rush of blood straight to his dick and he groaned lowly. You were bent over a suitcase, legs spread and body fully naked, pussy directly within his line of sight. He walked over quietly until he had come to stand directly behind you. You, somehow not noticing him yet, continued rummaging through your suitcase, searching for a pair of comfortable panties. Slowly, Chanyeol raised his hand. One long, calloused finger ran along an exposed fold and your knees buckled, Chanyeol’s other hand reaching out to hold you up.
“On the bed, Angel” He spoke, one finger still teasing your now slightly wet pussy. You walked to the bed and crawled to the middle, making sure to dip your hips with every movement. You laid down, spreading your legs, knees in the air. Chanyeol stood without moving and you waited, the room growing warmer with every second he stared at your exposed cunt. Finally he moved towards you and you sighed, propping yourself up on your elbows to watch his every move. His tall, warm body hovered over yours and his lips met yours gently, licking your lips and tugging on your bottom lip. One finger met your lower lips again, tracing from your clit and following your folds down, down, down, circling your hole and starting the process over again. You moaned softly, and he slipped his tongue into your mouth, caressing before suckling on your tongue.
His lips left yours and trailed across your cheek and down your throat to your thundering pulse where a soft “You don’t know what you do to me” was whispered. You smiled gently and giggled as his lips and tongue worked their way down to one breast, kissing the sensitive nub gently. He drew back, looking you in the eyes as his face drew near again and a tongue gently spread against the now hardened nub. You whimpered, and he blew a cold gust of air across the wet nub, watching as yours eyes fluttered shut.
His tongue flicked out again, only to be replaced by a warm mouth sucking slowly. One hand met the back of his head and you pushed your chest into mouth. “Chanyeol, please” you whispered, and your back arched as you bit down harshly, the pain turning into pleasure, your empty pussy clenching, begging to be filled.
His tongue marked a path down to his fingers, still just barely tracing over your wet pussy. He laid down between your legs, wrapping two muscled arms around your thighs. “My beautiful, beautiful, Angel and her sweet as sin pussy” he grinned, thumb brushing over your clit before pinching and pulling gently.
He bent down, opening his mouth before one thick tongue replaced his finger on your clit. He circled, sucked, nipped, marveling in the wetness starting to drip from your lips to the bed. He ducked his head and moved his pretty pink lips over your opening. Not a second too soon his tongue entered you, stretching as deep as it could go before running across your walls, flicking inside of you. Your other hand left the bed and tangled itself in his hair as you pulled him into your wet heat, hips grinding desperately against his face.
With every upwards thrust your hips made his nose bump against your clit. “Fuck” you moaned, and he removed his tongue to form a small ‘o’ around your opening with his lips. You whimpered, missing his tongue, and he laughed lowly, the vibrations making you even wetter, adding to the pressure building up within you. His thumb returned to your clit, rubbing it quickly before his lips began sucking. He sucked hard, stopping to nip at your folds or lap at your entrance every few seconds, moaning in his deep voice at the taste of your wetness.
The ball of burning need inside of you was making you restless, and your head whipped back and forth as his tongue worked against you.
Without warning, two fingers thrust into your dripping core, scissoring quickly. You gasped, back arching, hands throwing themselves out to grip the pillow under your head. His fingers pulled out and you whimpered, hips bucking into the air where his fingers should have been. Three fingers returned to your cunt, pounding into you with a pace that was making stars burst behind your eyelids. He twisted his fingers around, curling them against your walls, and you screamed as he hit the place in you that made your whole body explode. Your eyes flashed open to see-
Chanyeol.
Between your legs.
In your home in Seoul, South Korea.
Nowhere near the beach.
He pulled his fingers from your dripping pussy, trailing them through your folds before taking them into his mouth and sucking them clean. His eyes were closed as he released his fingers with a ‘pop’, lowering his lips to your pussy and lapping up your cum. He sucked, he licked, he sucked again.
All too soon, he had cleaned you up and was quietly moving to lay back down next to you, not realizing you had woken up.
You laid still, grinning in the dawning light, listening as you heard a heavy sigh come from the beautiful man beside you. You turned your head slowly to look at him, nearly moaning as you saw one large hand slowly pumping his hardened cock, thumb brushing the tip with every upward stroke. You admired the man beside you, working himself, and almost moaned again as you saw him starting to lose control.
His hips began bucking into his hand, grip a little rougher and movements a little quicker as he neared the edge, moans and sighs leaving him more often and much louder in volume. Right when you knew he was album to cum you reached out, fingers circling and tightly grasping his base to stop him. He jumped, stumbling over apologies before you shushed him.
“I quite like waking up to you between my legs, babe. You should do it more often” you giggled, crawling over to straddle him, hand still gripping his thick, hard cock. He groaned, letting out a weak “oh, fuck” as you moved your hand to his tip, tracing the pulsing veins of his dick down to his balls, cupping them gently before gripping him again. You lined him up and slowly lowered yourself, sighing as his cock filled you up, inch by inch. “Move, baby” you whispered, and he began pumping in and out of you slowly, hands wrapping around your waist to help support you as you began moving in synch with his thrusts. One of his hands left your hip to play with your still-sensitive clit and you clenched around him, making him groan.
“God, I love you” he said thickly, bucking as you clenched around him again. You leaned down and pecked his lips, licking the taste of you off of them as you began moving your hips in tight circles, Chanyeol’s thrusts becoming deeper and less coordinated as you pushed him over the edge he was already on the brink of.
He grunted as your tight walls pulsed around him again, cock releasing, coating your walls in his seed.
You came again shortly after, still buzzing from your last orgasm, and laid down on top of him. “I love you, too” you smiled against his racing pulse, before getting up and walking towards your bathroom.
“Where are you going?” He whined, patting the bed beside him half heartedly. “I wanna cuddle.” You laughed, turning towards him again. “Channie, I can feel you dripping from my cunt. I gotta shower.” And you continued your path to the shower, turning on the water.
You smiled at yourself in the mirror as the steam fogged it up. You figured he’d be in here after you so you left him a little note in the glass. “Thank you, Mr.Magic Tongue Man.”
Roughly thirty minutes later you left the shower, drying off before walking to Chanyeol’s closet. You took out a simple white t-shirt and put it on along with a black pair of your panties and sat on the bed, brushing your hair. About halfway through, a scent reached your nose.
Bacon.
It was bacon.
By God, it was bacon.
You squealed, rushing through the rest of your hair before running out of your shared room, down the hallway, sliding to a stop in the kitchen. You smiled widely as you saw your beautiful man bent over the stove, peeling bacon off of a pan.
You sat down and sighed. “How did I get so lucky?” you mused aloud, and he laughed. “I could say the same thing, Angel.”
After a few minutes he turned around with one plate of food and sat in front of you. “Where’s yours?” you questioned, cocking your head. “I already ate this morning” he responded, winking. You barked out a laugh and dug in, moaning at the flavor. You looked up at him and grinned,
“Sex, food, and you. My three favorite things.”
