Would using a binder cause problems for me later on down the road if I decide to breastfeed any kids I might have?
Tw pregnancy mentioned, lactation, internal organs
I don’t see why it would. It shouldn’t have a major destructive impact on the vascular mammary structures i don’t think. This is a good an interesting question. Binding is actually a practice that dates back a lot further as a way to secure and clothe chests than the modern bra. Binding is ok provided it’s not too uncomfortable. The only thing is it’s not advisable if you’re lactating or otherwise producing milk, even though it’s an old school practice to wean down and stop producing milk postpartum.

hi! im nonbinary (i guess... agender but i dont rly like that label so i just go by nb if thats ok) and well, i find myself attracted to any unless they identify as male (fully or partially, in any form) so i was wondering what the right term would be? i used to id as lesbian back when i id'd as female and before i knew abt nb... also would i be considered trans or no? sorry to put 2 questions in 1 ask! thanks for your time!!
I mean you could say you’re attracted to men. You could use words like “gay” and “queer” if you want to. Yes you can definitely use the word trans. You can use the word trans and the word nb without like qualifying or identifying more specifically.

Does a binder permanently affect your breasts or is it only while you're wearing one?
Over time (like repeated use) it can make you more saggy tbh.

I've got asthma and wearing a binder has never been a problem in that way, my chest tissue hurts if I wear it for a long time though. But as long as I don't use it all the time/take breaks it's cool c:
thanks for the info!

Labels are meant to help you make sense of yourself. They are not for other people to dictate, and they are not set in stone. You are allowed to shed old labels, and to take new ones when it feels appropriate, without shame. You are, have been, and will always be 100% real and 100% valid. You are you, and you are wonderful.

Is it okay to wear binders if you have asthma or something like that? I've heard that binding makes it harder to breathe and I would like to know this because I don't have asthma (I used to, though) but just having someone lay on my chest/stomach area will sometimes make it hard for me to breathe so... like... would it still be safe to wear a binder?
i do not have asthma or wear a binder, so take this with a grain of salt. most importantly, if you try something out and it makes it difficult for you to breathe, or causes discomfort in any other way, you should stop immediately.that said, binders are specifically designed to compress the chest and stomach areas with minimal restriction of the lungs. binding with multiple sports bras, on the other hand, or using other DIY methods, will probably not be as safe or comfortable, because they are not specifically designed for this purpose. you are also likely to have better luck with a higher quality binder. i would also advise restricting use to only a few hours at a time, possibly wearing a slightly looser fit, and avoiding strenuous activity or exercise while wearing your binder. above all, do what is safe for you. if possible, try purchasing from a place with a good return policy so that if you do have trouble with the binder you choose, you can return it.–max

am I validated as a non binary person AFAB not covering or wearing a hijab as a revert muslim? even during prayer?
I have some theories about this, but I’m unfortunately not knowledgeable enough about hijab to really give you any kind of information.  To the best of my memory, specifications one states of coverage during prayer went to only ‘men’ and ‘women’, so.. yeha that’s a damn tough question.I know that there are some non binary muslims who follow this blog, so; if y’all see this, and you have information and evidence which would help answer this question, I urge you to share. Thank you.-N

"Matriarchy is no less heterosexual than patriarchy: it is only the sex of the oppressor that changes. Furthermore, not only is this conception still imprisoned in the categories of sex (woman and man), but it holds onto the idea that the capacity to give birth (biology) is what defines a woman. Although practical facts and ways of living contradict this theory in lesbian society, there are lesbians who affirm that “women and men are different species or races (these words are used interchangeably): men are biologically inferior to women; male violence is a biological inevitability…” By doing this, by admitting that there is a “natural” division between women and men, we naturalize history, we assume that “men” and “women” have always existed and will always exist. Not only do we naturalize history, but also consequently we naturalize the social phenomena which express our oppression, making change impossible."

I get that your point isn't to help research, but you should at least care about proving nb people existed before now. You act like you don't care about proving that nb identities aren't just something tumblr made up.
I can’t speak for anyone else here but I don’t care about proving anything related to that. I have no personal use for or interest in some kind of material evidence for the absence of a social construct (binary genders), because whether or not non binary genders existed before, in antiquity or pre-colonialism, they exist now, which matter more to me on a personal level.Obviously that’s not going to be true for everyone and I know and appreciate why that evidence matters, but it’s not something of great personal importance to me in my day-to-day life.-N

the purpose of your blog should be to help everyone, no matter what they're asking. you've come off as very rude many times.
Listen, the purpose of our blog is to help nonbinary people, and help with question that are best answered by nonbinary people who have experience with being nonbinary. It is not to do research, that is the job of a reference librarian. We get a lot of hateful questions and we get no patience so please forgive us if we aren’t always ready to answer everything perfectly cordially. We are real people and we just don’t have that in us with the load of crap we get.
