The Producers of this Blog would like to thank the following people for their inspiration over the past seven years.
George - for being my number one fan, and the person in my head who I write all these posts to. If there was only one person in the world reading these I'd hope it was you.
Kylie - for being an inspiration since before I even knew who I was. I always wanted to be you. You are the trailblazer, and I the jester.
Pooky - for being the sane half of my diseased brain.  You are as much me, as I am you.
Steph - for being a huge blogspiration.
The Reader - whoever you are, whether we met in real life and became friends, if you ever posted a comment or read it anonymously.  I can't believe anyone would read this, and always felt like a superstar because anyone did.
I feel I have covered everything I want to say. This blog is in dangerous territory of becoming a 'look at all the cool things I am doing' diatribe, and whilst that is good just in case I ever get amnesia and need to look back in time to see what I did to make me who I am. I never wanted to write a travel blog. If I ever made anyone snicker at my ridiculousness, that makes it all worth it.
Vaarwel. Elalleqa. Donadoghovi. Hagoonea. Ahoj. Sayonara. Auf Wiedersehen. Ciao. Au Revoir. Aloha. Shalom. Farvel. Alvida. Ayo. Dag.
Hasta La Vista Baby.
