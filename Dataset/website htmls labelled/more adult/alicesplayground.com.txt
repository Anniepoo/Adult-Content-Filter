how must you ache
i understand
at least you have me
i promise to make it
to make your sacrifices worth it
just a week
easily spared
meanings of gold
tears
aching for you
that selfish fucker
cannot describe
absolutely speechless
just do
at least
prove the least
– – – –
fifth day
twenty eighth day
two hundred eighty eighth day
two zero one six
no boys
no c o c a i n e
my numbers
little goals
every second that ticks
all the credit is mine
i’ve done it now
– – – –
– – – –
warped between thirteen and fourteen
first segment of the year
high and up above
with my golden wings
accelerating through with ease
a student to the earth
a lover to self fellow beings
a giver returning blessings
a master to focused thoughts
cannot lie
cannot say i am not greedy
i want it all
i want to feel it all
i want to embrace all of it
– – – –
vision
layers
my own space
rustic stories
originality
splashes of colour
opening my eye
seek standing still
in the moment
combination of the senses
product of my membrane
touch down
creatively flowing
enjoying the process
little pranks of le beloved mercury
laughing it off
retracing my thoughts
tradition and rules
research and decompose
out of the box i say
no box can contain this
i grow
expansion is due
looking forward
delighted to grasp
this future of mine
ready to fight relentlessly
for my own recognition

but i am actually good
can’t help if we’re tilted
i miss prosthesis and mended thoughts
trampled over beauty while singing their souls
i match them with my euphoria
when they said ‘je suis plus folle que toi’
don’t be a downer
i am in my right place
– – – –
rolling through day ten
nine days of no boys
no boys prioritized
much more focus
much more productivity
much more stabilized mood
much more happiness
tis truly great
proud am i
twenty days to go
infinite possibilities
– – – –
sisterhood
rebonded
resealed
best day ever
best captures ever
best everything ever
new direction?
together, maybe?
would be nice
must wait a bit to see
our respect
our love
our teamwork
our selflessness
pretty fucking awesome
more adventures please
tilted we are
til death do us part
– – – –
life
so good
itching to rebel
will i flip
whale i hold
time will tell
l i v i n g
– – – –
– – – –
twelve days
more whole than ever
w o w z a
clearer of what i seek
vision compiling
love
to share
to have
to hold
no bullshit
no fronts
make the best of
duration dont matter
as long as there’s growth
– – – –
– – – –
twentieth day
clearest now
you’re the one i like
i actually like you
your smile
your laugh
your uniqueness
your passion
your hands
your calmness
your safety
the way you look at me
the way you laugh with me
what i originally thought
appearance faded into the background
it wasn’t about that
i still think you’re that big thing
big thing coming for me
still ever so confused
all the lack of
being away defined my mind
tis actually isn’t lust or obsession
pure enjoyment in our soul connection
wonder if this does that for you as well
hopeful
i sincerely ask
the heavens and above
wait i shall
round and round
– – – –
big boy
sweetest
never have i received
this kind of affection
might be a bit much
kind of want to run
oddly stressful
shifting to appreciation
just have to remember
we accept the love we think we deserve
i deserve this
not only from him
but from any and all romantic connection to have
the beginning
new route
okay enjoy myself
– – – –
three and a half more days
wrapping it up
the bestest fucking year
the greatest fucking year
as if I had golden stars
shooting star rockets underneath my feet
flying me through the land of luck
high above cloud nine
savoring this dish called life
course by course
jaw dropping unravels
amazing moments experiences
never the same feels duplicates
plating tasting those perfectly imperfect bits
all new
all of the best
all of the glitz
i fucking love my life
i fucking love me
wishes granted
one after another
fortunes the theme
my whole entire life
delayed realization
to say the least, i swear
surreal
ethereal
bizarre
fanatical

real

code
don’t say no
no doors closed
all roads opened
the pick of the world
– – – –
the inevitable
not so bad actually
facing it soberly
ace of clubs it shuts
karmic
i owe you
if this is all
praise the lord
farewell can easily be bid
neptune
the fantasy to you
rose colored goggles
can’t see me for who i am
i can see that
if not even purposely driven
not sure
i assumed of more pull
be it, let go
pluto
want to lure you in
want the restriction
want you to wear your heart for me
if the chance
i shall conquer
i seldomly swear
three times the fun
waits the game
hope to cross paths again
i am grateful
good riddance to you for now
xoxo

treasure map
so surreal
is this really happening
two years later
long overdue
wonder what’s in store
honest no game
in it just for the fun
perfect aesthetics
look forward to
touch, feel, play
don’t tease
for real
come inside
i am ready
– – – –
the accent
the gentleman
completely wowed
expecting fuckboy nonetheless
tomorrows the night
apologize for the wait
best version is worth it
pinky promised
good asset
toy i deem
– – – –
– – – –
creative space
talents the bore
what is the motive
the green?
the booze?
the women?
the passion?
how to assume ones
unsure
who cares
the glitz and glamour
always replaced
one after another
the sooner you look
the clearer it becomes
transparent
melodic
dark
grunge
what does that all embody?
what is everyone chasing?
what glosses these glasses?
dream chasing money back guarantee?
questions questions questions
up close and personal
negatively positive spaces
problem child
my muse
my inspiration
opening my eyes
growing visuals
love it
embrace it
– – – –
after thoughts
actual genuine
facade to impress the glam
goofy goody what
going under
blown up it may be
best of luck to you
pretty face
layered presentation
yet to puzzle
open to create
present more
further
we shall see
name necklace
bid farewell
five years
tear
fuck my life
carelessnesssssss
– – – –
– – – –
tucking the rest of the year up
managing the thoughts carefully
thank all that not belong
welcome all ye positive and bright
focusing on this being
the being of self
the beings of my space
make it full
make it passion
make it shine
make it completely mine

somewhere
over that
over that hump
i am
sounds of the ocean
waves of the atlantic
the best vibes
with my one and only
– – – –
going along
some kinds of fun
wazing through crowds
experiencing visual forms
creative lives
we us then
sacred works of all
interconnected through this platform
free expression
venus’s the limit
get on that
boxes of cubicles
heart and souls
all bits of brain juice
splashes of the taints
glossy over that source of boom
vibrance
minimal
shapes
contrast
influenced
light up
steel works of art
art that tells of ones deepest secrets
its that
that’s amazing
that outlet
– – – –
no matter if
you are great
it shall be your loss
if and maybe why
not sure what to think
calming myself
reeling my thoughts in
not worth it really
too much to explore
can’t hold on to your spot
see how it plays
numbered days
blerch
what can you offer me
besides that sense of security
that tall glass of eye candy
nothing else really
adventure…eh
love…eh
sex…hmm
exactly
so there is much to be proven
until then
don’t get too comfortable boo
get ready for a fight
prize of your life
mm okay thanks bye
– – – –
treasure map
have you finally gathered snack and supplies
hunting in that city of ours
first ever exchange
– – – –
big ol’ grey cloud
what are you up to
What are you thinking
what do you do
my curiosity gets the best of me
i know there’s warnings
shall tread carefully
arms length
don’t mind the fire
hope not to get burned
reveal yeself!
– – – –
i reminisce
for the thousandth time i swear
the last tangle
fitting so perfectly in yours
your fingertips traced over my skin
marking itself ever so familiarly
playing the keys to the tunes of my soul
the touch of magic
you have
i fucking miss
the thought of you
the texts of you
the smiles of you
the smell of you
lingering
never forgotten
connected through the cloud of sound
forever and more
lost in you no longer
i should be glad
a tad i guess
sanity > it all
– – – –
cheerio proposal
i know what you want
i am unable to fulfill that position right now
my bad for peeling the old wound
its truly unfair
my head clearly knows
how perfect you’d treat me
unready for that
that step is big
too big for us at the moment
my apologies
– – – –
nineteen months
can it be?
anticipating
might be light and fun
comfort at the least
see ya thursday!
– – – –
so much media
too much
too fucking much
someone something somewhere
telling you
who to be
what to think
no room for self growth
UGH
i know the inevitable
i don’t want to complain
i can’t say i am completely free of
BUT F U C K
how can i avoid
take the first steps of my path
completely out of the box
never the first
can it be
born dis da hipsters
weird loop
unsolvable loop
the only one i am responsible for is
me, myself and i
center and stand tall
do my best
live my life
let all else flow on
– – – –
all these distractions
all these males
just need to remind myself
of the one criteria
you must be passionate about me
no passion
no go
not settling for anything less
oh, the ease
i got this
reminded!
– – – –
keep reading
keep praticing
that unconditional love
keep searching
keep experiencing
all the pieces falling together
all once so broken
falling back together so perfectly
believe in me
take me higher
i love this life
i love my life
– – – –
twinsie
matching
all day
all night
this soul twin of mine
unlike any other i have met
her individuality
leads me gently to inspire me
gives me space to grow into my own
some sort of opposites
but we work
hey
like magic on ice
no sense but what sense to life really
this trip
we made it our own
we made it one of the bests
another city to add to the books
so many more adventures to come
the best duo
you’ve got to show me love
pillow fights
i got handled
snapchat noobies
natural conversationalists
instant moments
imperfectly perfect moments
all the moments
recorded
remembered
woo
you’s it

the first
kind of normal
almost want to reabuse myself
but no reason to
you’ve given me absolutely none
nothing to rebel
nothing to solidify
flowing in the air
aimlessly
old ways
pounds of white
snuffed up
adds a bit of dopamine
that tad of false silver lining
what i am used to
undoubt
the most extreme forms
life at its fine
little voices tell me so
this time around
clear feelings
grown up maturity
odd sense of security
slightly intangible
but i feel it
confirmed by two of cups
i want to rush
for what
ugh
trust it
let it be
flow
it goes
– – – –
so many firsts
sober experiences
yet to fall in love
something i anticipate
loving life utterly
passions unfolding magically
this being i am becoming
beyond amazing
so whole
so new
so bomb
i dig myself completely
– – – –
passionate
discover the creative
explore the components
what develops character
what impacts their growth
how to pinpoint
this new train of though
little souls
my destiny is to make you whole
i want to show you the roads
roads of few mistakes
wish yous can learn from mine
this battle of life
will be won by you and i
passion check
determination check
skills not yet checked
see more
hear more
maybe this is the year
next twelve months
git it git it

I feel so lucky
this journey of life

cherish the perfection

miles away
lies the twist
completely faded feels
sucks it reals
over it
fast fading memories
must be the time
i say i will remember you
holding i within twinkling lights
that alpha tone
the crazy embrace
slipping away
slipping through my fingertips
documented
cutie, thanks
once upon a time
and so it goes

words rolling in
ten thousand miles high
eastbound we head
trip of a lifetime

The greatest of human emotions is love. The most valuable of human gifts is the ability to learn. Therefore, learn to love. –UJ Ramdas
i wonder
what it takes
for my papa bear
to figure this simple concept out
complexity
seems to be the theme
ever-changing
instability
i
planted seeds
seeds of thought
hoping for that silver lining
hoping that it is not too late
that sense of loneliness
that sight of hopelessness
what has led you to this
series of unfortunate decisions
little voices
i do regret
not staying and fight it out
i mustn’t guilt
i needed my sanity
i needed to become who i am right now
to be the rock they need
in time as such
this is heavy
heavier than accustomed
i foresee lots of directions
i felt weird things
its my time to give back
sending my parentals the best
unconditional love
from their blood their heart
my mama bear
how i cringe
at the person he made you be
how much you have sacrificed
for him and the rest
i understand
i promise not to let you down
pride in me
i assure you
i will take you above and beyond
bring you inner peace
expose you to more beautiful scapes
better angles of life
– – – –
i
have so much
fucking feelings
emotions
overloading my tear ducts
flooding my cheeks
fogging my brain
last day is the hardest
night is darkest before dawn
my whole journey has led me to this
to this peak of reality
i won’t shy away
i am fucking ready
to battle this out
with the love i have for my family
alongside my bloods
keep bettering myself
be swifter than the rest
must glue us together
the destiny
– – – –
one day away
one year anniversary
version two point oh
evolving into version two point one
as i type
the deepest of my neurowaves
this outlet i have
make the best of
odd talent i have
dont stop
