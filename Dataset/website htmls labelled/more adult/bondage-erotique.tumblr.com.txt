I have been deeply exploring the beautiful, sensual, insightful world of Shibari since 2011.
Rope has been one of my greatest teachers. I have learned more about myself on this journey than I ever would have guessed: about the strength of vulnerability, the ways we process sensation, how we
communicate (verbally and non-verbally), and the places where we are all strong or weak, tight or flexible (physically and emotionally). I treasure my relationship to rope and am here to share my images and insights.
I wish I knew who to credit this with because it deserves to be acknowledged (can anyone comment on the source here?)In very few lines, the artist has drawn EXACTLY how I feel when being tied. Let’s call it: Heart Strings.

As I began to love myself
As I began to love myself I found that anguish and emotional sufferingare only warning signs that I was living against my own truth.Today, I know, this is “AUTHENTICITY”.As I began to love myself I understood how much it can offend somebodyAs I try to force my desires on this person, even though I knew the timewas not right and the person was not ready for it, and even though thisperson was me. Today I call it “RESPECT”.As I began to love myself I stopped craving for a different life,and I could see that everything that surrounded me was inviting me to grow. Today I call it “MATURITY”.As I began to love myself I understood that at any circumstance,I am in the right place at the right time, and everything happensat the exactly right moment. So I could be calm.Today I call it “SELF-CONFIDENCE”.As I began to love myself I quit steeling my own time,and I stopped designing huge projects for the future.Today, I only do what brings me joy and happiness, things I love to doand that make my heart cheer, and I do them in my own way and inmy own rhythm. Today I call it “SIMPLICITY”.As I began to love myself I freed myself of anything that is no good formy health – food, people, things, situations, and everything that drewme down and away from myself. At first I called this attitudea healthy egoism. Today I know it is “LOVE OF ONESELF”.As I began to love myself I quit trying to always be right, and ever sinceI was wrong less of the time. Today I discovered that is “MODESTY”.As I began to love myself I refused to go on living in the past and worryabout the future. Now, I only live for the moment, where EVERYTHINGis happening. Today I live each day, day by day, and I call it “FULFILLMENT”.As I began to love myself I recognized that my mind can disturb meand it can make me sick. But As I connected it to my heart, mymind became a valuable ally. Today I call thisconnection “WISDOM OF THE HEART”.We no longer need to fear arguments, confrontations or any kind of problems with ourselves or others. Even stars collide, and out of their crashing new worlds are born. Today I know THAT IS “LIFE”! -Charlie Chaplin

Rope is a journey into trust. Here is a pinnacle moment in that profound, challenging, rewarding journey, for me. Performing with Kanso at Symbiosis Gathering 2015. Bound in a back bendy face up, shot with arrows and pulleyed upwards of 25′ high, slowly swiveling above a sea of faces, the most of which had never laid their eyes on rope bondage before. What beautiful instances we can find ourselves in, in this life! I closed my eyes to take in all the sounds and the air, I opened them to absorb the energy of the crowd, and felt, incredibly calm.

When a boxtie feels like the architecture of home
I am fairly certain I could say I appreciate every single one going on me.There are countless, we know, but they bring with them the anticipation of what lies ahead, and the initial embrace from my partner. the foundational surrender. the offering. patience.I believe the more one gets tied into a boxtie, the more one craves and treasures being tied into a boxtie. In other words, it doesn’t get old. It actually gets better.Different personalities, varied tensions.True, there are some days when my skin just itches in the rope. It’s always a bit of a surprise that my body can be so adverse to one of the materials I love the most. But, we all have our days, and we do have our cycles, and so things vary.And then, then! there are those extraordinary moments when the perfect boxtie is laid upon me. I can count these occasions on…two hands, they are precious and memorable. and I can tell from the first wrap…this one here, is going to be a good one. and every wrap and cinch and friction and tension confirms my gut feeling.The form lays upon me like the framework of a house.I understand, from within, the reason for every rope needing to be placed the way it is, I feel myself meld with its structure.We are the architecture for the journey ahead.I don’t need every single boxtie to feel like this. We all have so-so days. I wouldn’t want this sensation to become ordinary and expected. And I treasure that quick knowing, when I do sense one building.Be still now, Blue, you are headed home. or home is headed to you. Or you both are what is home.

I had the pleasure recently of tying and photographing my beautiful friend Bobochee. She is a fellow photographer and rope lover and we had an awesome time collaborating.
