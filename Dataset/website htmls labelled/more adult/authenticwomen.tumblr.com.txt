LEFT: Original photo by scottworldwide.RIGHT: Stolen photo, altered and with a watermark added.
I try not to focus on the negative. But I think this needs to be addressed.
That is NOT what my hips look like, but I see photos of myself get stolen and edited in this manner all the time. I see photos in my feed of other women having the same edits done to them. If you see a photo like this, do a reverse image search. You can usually find the original photo that way.Altering my body in this way is just as destructive to body image as trying to make me look slimmer would. It is unreal, it is unattainable. Being curvy can be attractive without animated proportions.
On top of all of that, DO NOT EDIT PHOTOS YOU DON’T OWN. It isn’t just unethical, its illegal. That includes edits like the photos above, but also includes adding a filter, changing something to black and white, and any other alteration. If you respect the photographer, you’d never edit their photo. If you respected the model, you’d never edit their body like that. Adding your own watermark is a slap in the face. It. Is. Stealing. And it isn’t stealing from a giant corporation, it is stealing from small artists and creators of content who aren’t even generally asking for pay, just credit.
What you can do: - Don’t do this shit yourself!- If you know anyone doing this shit tell them to cut it out! - Don’t follow blogs if you know they steal images!- Don’t follow blogs if they add their watermark to everything they post if they don’t create the content too!- Don’t reblog photos that you think might have been extremely altered! Look for the original with google image search.- Follow the creators of the content you like, which is the easiest way to get your images unaltered and with credits intact.
Thanks to all my lovely followers who are so good about this stuff and even tip me off when they see things like this floating around. You guys have my back and I super appreciate it!
Agreed to EVERYTHING you said girl. I’ve had enough of this shit!
Important!
