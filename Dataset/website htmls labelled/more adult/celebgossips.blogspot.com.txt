Nicolas Sarkozy Gifted Similar Diamond Ring To Carla Bruni And Ex-wife Cecilia
Picture of the same diamond ring on Carla Bruni and Cecilia's fingerFrench president Nicolas Sarkozy gave a $30,000 engagement diamond jewelry to new fiancee Carla Bruni - who is now also rumoured to be pregnant with his child - when he proposed to her in Egypt on Christmas Day.But as the picture shown above, Sarkozy has given the same diamond ring to his previous wife Cecilia in 2006.Perhaps he is incredibly forgetful, or perhaps his secretary bought Carla's ring without showing it to him.

Jenna Jameson wants Theron to Pose Nude
Ex-porn star Jenna Jameson desperately wants Oscar winning actress Charlize Theron to pose naked for PETA's "Go Naked" campaign.Jameson admitted she thinks Theron should pose for animal rights group PETA's "Go Naked" campaign."It would be amazing if Charlize Theron did one of our 'Go Naked' campaigns. I saw her just the other day and she just blew me away."Charlize is so sexy - I would totally love for her to go naked. I'd die for that," Jameson said.The adult star is the new spokesperson for the group's anti-leather campaign and added that Theron can take over from her as an "ultimate sex icon".She said: "Bettie Page was the ultimate sex icon. Next came Marilyn Monroe, then Pamela Anderson, then me. Now I'm on the lookout for the next woman to pass my title on to. Charlize would be perfect."

Nicole Richie doesn't want bigger breasts
New-mommy Nicole Richie doesn't seem to like her curvy post-pregnancy body, as nursing has left her with bigger breasts that don't go with her fashion style.The socialite and her rocker boyfriend Joel Madden have recently become parents to baby daughter Harlow Kate Winter Madden. And even after getting back to her svelte shape in just weeks after the birth, Richie has been left with significantly bigger bust due to nursing.And the 26-year-old is uncomfortable with this look as she cannot wear the kind of clothes she likes."I'm bustier now, and I really don't like it. It doesn't really fit with my wardrobe, it's not who I am. I am not someone who is used to wearing a bra or having to wear a bra I really don't like it," Contactmusic quoted her, as saying.She added: "I like wearing vintage hippy see-through shirts that aren't slutty on me because there's nothing to look at. Now I have boobs so I can't really wear it because it sends out a different message."

Kate Beckinsale reveals her best physical asset
Kate Beckinsale reveals that her best physical asset lies below the belt, and that she even has a special name for it. The 'Serendipity' star reveals to Allure magazine that she calls her lady treasure as "Pharaoh's Tomb", and that she's been told it's 'spectacular'."My best feature is unfortunately a private matter, although I'm told it is spectacular. But you can't really walk it down the red carpet. What can I say?" the New York Post quoted her, as telling the magazine. However, she is vehement that there's nothing sluttish about her, for contrary to popular opinion, there are very few people who she's slept with."I was called a slut when I split up with Michael [Sheen] and began seeing Len [Wiseman], but I've only ever had about three boyfriends. Only a handful of people have seen into the Pharaoh's Tomb!" she said.

Jessica Alba's slutty reputation
Jessica Alba was bullied and branded a "slut" when she was in school after developing her full bosom at a young age.The actress revealed that the main culprits were her classmates' "self-righteous" mothers and her elementary school principal, who made her life miserable.Writing in 'If I'd Known Then' a forthcoming book of essays by female celebrities Alba writes: "The accusation still ricochets. They think I'm a slut?'"Revealing her first kiss at the age of 7, Alba also handed out advice to teenaged girls, urging them to have safe sex. "Boys are awful. They are made of nothing but hormones until they're about 20 or 21," she wrote."It's fun to have a crush, but don't think it's forever," she added. The essay collection, set for publication this spring, features letters by famous women, 35 or younger, written to their younger selves. Contributors include Olympic soccer gold medallist Julia Foudy, activist Zainab Salbi and actress Danica McKellar.
