Fast Start for 2007 Booble Racing Nissan 200SX
Memphis, TN. Booble Racing and driver Peter Zekert were fast out of the box, winning both days of the Midwest season opener at Memphis Motorsports Park. On Saturday, Zekert and the team lowered the lap record (set by the Booble Racing Team last spring) by nearly 1/2 second! "The car was good and on paper it looks like we had a magic weekend. Nothing could be farther from the truth. We worked hard all weekend."On the last lap of Saturday's race, a new oil fitting loosened and, within half a lap, allowed the Booble Racing Nissan 200SX to drop 3 quarts of Redline Racing Oil on the track surface. It took more than an hour for track workers to dry the track, using several hundred pounds of oil dry. Back in the pit area, Zekert evaluated the car. "Luckily I shut it down before serious damage to the engine. We have to repair and oil pump and check oil lines, but we should be back in business tomorrow." Late through the night the team worked. Unfortunately, they could not get the engine to crank any oil pressure. The team missed Sunday morning qualifying. "That is the first session I have missed in 5+ years!" said Zekert. Without a qualifying timee, Zekert was relegated to last starting position on the grid. Luckily, Memphis in spring means small crowds and this year, a small field of cars. Starting last in a 15 car field is a lot better than starting last in a 70 car field [at some of the larger tracks]. At the start, Zekert and the Booble Racing Nissan were on the move, passing slower qualified cars. By the end of lap 1 Zekert was in 9th place (3rd in GTL). Lap by lap Zekert would catch and pass cars, slowly catching Bryan Floyd (2nd in GTL) and Brad Lewis (1st in GTL). By the midpoint in the race, Zekert was hot on the tail of Lewis, now running 1-2 in GTLite. With about 10 laps to go, Zekert got by Lewis and assumed the GTL lead, stretching the lead to almost 15 seconds at one point. With two laps to go, Zekert slowed, allowing Lewis to catch right up on his bumper. The two crossed the finish line only 10 feet apart. "I didn't realize that was Brad (Lewis) behind me. I thought that was a lapped car. I almost gave away the win! Stupid me." Next appearance for Zekert and the Booble Racing Nissan 200SX: Gateway Int'l Raceway, St. Louis MO April 28-29. Come check us out!

One Booble Car Blows, Another Goes!
Topeka, KS. Two Team Booble cars competed in the SCCA GTLite National Championship race at Heartland Park Topeka. Peter Zekert in the Booble Racing Nissan 200SX started on the front row, but blew up in a cloud of smoke on the main straightaway on lap 6. Behind Zekert during the lap 6 smoke show, Bill Gilcrease in the MinComp Booble Racing Mini held off a late race charge by third place finisher Doug Ruthroff to finish second place.

Booble Team Stuns GTLite and Claims Pole Position
Topeka, KS. Oct. 10, 2006. In a stunning upset, underdog Peter Zekert and the Booble Racing Nissan 200SX claimed the pole position for the 2006 SCCA GTLite Runoffs. Zekert's fast time of 1:53.0 eclipsed past Champion Arnie Loyning and multi-time Champion Jim Dentici by 0.4 and 0.6 seconds respectively. Conditions were idea with cool weather, overcast skys and dense air. "The engines made horsepower today." When asked whether he could remain on the pole position, Zekert said, "There are two more days and I expect Arnie or Jim to come close, if not eclipse my time. Now, if the weather gets warm, my time may hold." GTLite will have two more qualifying sessions on Wednesday and Thursday. The GTLite race is 10 am CDT Sunday Oct. 15, with a rebroadcast on Speed TV later in the year. Stay tuned for details.

National Champ bests Booble's "National Chump"
Topeka, KS. Past national champion James Dentici of Oconomowoc, WI and his Honda CRX team bested the Booble Racing Nissan 200SX at Heartland Park Topeka's SCCA National Race. Booble driver Peter Zekert has dominated the 2.5 mile Topeka road course this year, but got a taste of his own medicine. Zekert outqualified Dentici and the rest to the GTLite field, but was outgunned into the first turn. Zekert paced, but never caught Dentici's quick Honda. "Jim did to me what I did to Kirk in the spring race. He got the right start, put 4-5 car lengths on me and that was it. He's a talented driver and I knew I would need a perfect race plus good luck to beat him." Zekert finished second. Roy Lopshire, a Toyota driver from Kansas City, finished third.Adding insult to injury, Dentici set the fastest race lap and the new lap record at 1:55.971. Zekert ran 1:57.093 in the race, but had run a 1:55.870 in the morning warmup session earlier in the day. "Our car ran very well in the cool air of the morning. It still ran well in the race, but I needed that extra power I had in the morning." [Internal combustions make more horsepower in cooler, denser air.]The event on Heartland Park's 2.5 mile road course was a tune-up for next months SCCA National Championships. GTLite drivers from as far as South Carolina came to compete in the event. Next race for Zekert and the Booble Racing Nissan 200SX: Oct. 9-15 SCCA National Championships at Heartland Park Topeka.

Boobles are "Bigger in Texas"!
Angleton, TX. The Zekert Booble Racing team made a surprise trip to the MSR-Houston to race in the Houston Region SCCA's Speed Week National Race. The event was held at the 2.4 mile, 17 turn MSR-Houston track, 40 miles south of the downtown area in Angleton. Although MSR originally stood for Motor Sports Ranch, a private racing country club, the track is sponsored by Mercedes of Sugarland, and is now referred to as the Mercedes of Sugarland Ranch.The Booble team learned that Houston, TX is the capitol of breast implants in the United States. It was no surprise that the Booble stress boobs were a big hit with the competitors and crew alike. One rather well endowed woman asked if she could have a pair (of stress boobs) to augment her own equipment. Still not completely understanding the excesses of Texas women, the Booble team happily obliged. It is Bigger in Texas!On the racing front, Zekert and the Booble racing Nissan 200SX shattered the GTLite qualifying lap record by over 10 seconds, a remarkable feat, posting a time of 1:54.4! In Sunday's race, Zekert outran the GTLite field for his ninth win of the season and his third lap record. Race times were slightly slower in the heat of the day. Zekert and team Booble ran a fast lap of 1:56.8 early in the event, but slowed in the latter half due to a broken header tube. (See photo.) The cracked header vented hot exhaust gasses directly into the cockpit. "I put my hand out the window every chance I could get to direct some fresh air into the car. Luckily that was effective and I never got sick", remarked Zekert.Next race for the Zekert Booble Racing Nissan Team is at Heartland Park Topeka Sept. 2-3.

Booble team shows hometown advantage at Gateway
St.Louis, MO. Peter Zekert and the Booble Racing Nissan 200SX flexed their muscles and dominated both days at hometown Gateway Int'l Raceway. Zekert and Team Booble finished first in GTLite and first overall in Saturday's Regional race. The track temperatures were in the high 80s to low 90s, a welcome relief from the 100+ temperatures of the previous month. Still, lap times were slower than the cooler spring May Gateway race. In the race, Zekert posted a best lap time of 1:11.6, scoring credit for the fastest lap of the race. A total of fifteen cars finished Saturday's Regional race.On Sunday the field expanded to 27, as several drivers arrived to run in the National race only, competing for National Championship points and an invitation to the SCCA Runoffs in October. Jesse Prather of Topeka, KS sat on the pole in an F Production Mazda Miata. Zekert and the Booble team qualified 7th overall (and first in the GTLite catagory). Zekert's time was 1:11.9. "Qualifying was slow as the rear tires started to lose some grip and the track started to heat up. I was losing grip in the front and at the rear."In the race, Team Booble contracted the coaching skills of pro driver Travis Ward, placing Ward in the spotter's tower with radio contact to driver Zekert. With Ward's expert coaching, Zekert moved past 4 Spec Racer Ford cars and finished a few feet behind multi time national champion Kent Prather for fourth place overall. Zekert posted a fast lap of 1:11.084. "I couldn't have done it without the help of Travis in the spotter's tower, and Archie, Chris, RANDY and BRYAN back in the pits. It's a team effort."The next event for Zekert Team Booble racing is Sept. 2-3 at Heartland Park Topeka. Booble Racing fans are encouraged to visit the race team at Heartland Park in Topeka Kansas, Admission is free.

Booble Racing visits Mid-America Motorplex
Pacific Junction, IA.The Zekert/Booble race team made a quick stop to the Mid-America Motorplex south of Council Bluffs Iowa to compete in the MVRG "More Fun in the Sun" National race. "More Fun in the Sun"? It should have been "More HOT in the Sun" as the temperatures were above 104 degrees for the daytime races.Peter Zekert and the Nissan 200SX started at the end of the field, having missed qualifying because of a schedule conflict with the rain delayed Nascar Busch race the previous evening at Gateway International Raceway, St. Louis. [Zekert, a St. Louis native, was the PR & Media spokesman for the #30 Smith & Wesson Chevrolet with driver by Mike Bliss.]Starting 14th, Zekert moved past slower cars and ran in the top 1/2 of the field until the exhaust header broke for #1 cylinder. Zekert pulled the car onto pit lane and retired at the halfway point in the race, finishing in 24th position. "I could have continued, but it would have damaged the engine. I'll come back here next spring and race the track the right way" said Zekert.The next race for the Booble Zekert Racing Nissan 200SX is at Gateway Int'l Raceway St. Louis on August 12-13. Admission is free to all spectators at this Gateway Int'l Raceway event.
