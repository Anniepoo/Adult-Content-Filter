About the author
purpose of blog: Many women are insecure about their breasts. Along, with myself. So I thought there should be a place where we could embrace our chest:
small, big, real, fake, perky and the not so perky ones regardless. WE ARE ALL BEAUTIFUL.
rules:
- Must be 18+ to submit
- include age in submission
- tell us what you like/dislike about your breast (optional)
**yes, I'm the owner of "vaginasoftheworld"**
I hope this blog is just as succesful!
love you all, stay beautiful

I’m 18 and I use to be so self conscious about my boobs. I use to think they were too small. But i’ve grown to love them
they’re real cute! thanks :)

I can't really tell that one of your breasts is bigger then the other from the pic you posted, but they are lovely. Every pair of breasts submitted here are very beautiful,
ladies be proud of them.

Did you lose the other blog for good? Hard to imagine you would have changed the topic and deleted all the history without warning.
