Celebrating 80 Years
For 80 years, Aunt Sally’s has crafted the perfect New Orleans pralines by hand at our historic French Quarter location. Our family started with a copper pot, a historic recipe, and a single store in 1935.
Since then, with the addition of our St. Charles Avenue location and our online store, families all over the world have enjoyed Aunt Sally’s sweet treats and gourmet gifts.
Our kitchens have grown, but our methods have not changed. We believe some things are simply better when you take the time to do them right.
