Why I don’t own a house…
Me*** I don’t know. The dishwasher just stopped working.
Maintenance man*** It’s not plugged in.
Me*** Oh, I didn’t know they had plugs.

psychotherapy:
“In reality, most introverts are drained by small talk because it feels fake and meaningless. When you exchange pleasantries or chat about the weather to avoid silence, you don’t learn anything new or gain a better understanding of your conversation partner. Psychologist Laurie Helgoe, author of Introvert Power: Why Your Inner Life Is Your Hidden Strength, argues that small talk actually blocks honest interaction. “Introverts do not hate small talk because we dislike people,” she writes in her book. “We hate small talk because we hate the barrier it creates between people.”Along with feeling meaningless, small talk saps an introvert’s limited “people” energy. Imagine that introverts walk around with an invisible battery inside them that contains all their juice for social interaction. When they leave in the morning for school or work, the battery is probably close to full (if they’ve had enough downtime). Throughout the day, the battery gains or loses energy, depending on the situation. They talk to a good friend about a topic that interests them, and zip!—their battery is topped up. They make awkward small talk with an energetic acquaintance for a long time, and slurch!—their juice level dips.Author Diane Cameron aptly states, ‘Introverts crave meaning, so party chitchat feels like sandpaper to our psyche,’ or like the depleting of precious, precious energy.”-Jennifer Granneman
As an INFJ I know this quite well
