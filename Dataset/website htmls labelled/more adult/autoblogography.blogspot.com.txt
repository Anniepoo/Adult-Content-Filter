Myself
Myself
This is who I am, this is what life is, this is who you are.
These are songs about what it means to be human, and what the human condition is.

Here's a little something I started tonight. This one's for you...Yellow light day's coming to endWas once so bright, you drank it all downEmpty bottles inside my brainMagnifies nothing into troubles and painClose your eyes nowSleep on a bed of cloudsDon't forget you've drowned your dreams awayWhen I fight I don't use any wordsI don't want the chance to feel any worse (make it any worse)So I press that glass against my lipsAnd I swallow it all to the last dripClose your eyes nowSleep on a bed of cloudsDon't forget you've drowned your dreams awayYou don't know how I crave that next dropVodka rain's gonna clear my headI'm a poster child thrown awayVandalized face, don't deserve any nameClose my eyes nowWake up in a place I don't knowDrink myself into a smile

Butterfly
Butterfly spread your wings so wideGet out of here while you still canFor some change is hard to acceptIf it doesn't fit how they wantThey won't buy itYou tried so hard to explainThe color on your wings was who you wereThey didn't listenThey still won't listenThey just aren't interestedButterfly, your affliction hurts meBut it hurts you moreThe cure's here waiting for youGo on and have someDon't be afraidSweet nectarThey want a reason to despise youPoisoned dreams, poisoned wordsHates too strong to beatThe weight's pushing downCan't recoverButterfly spread your wings so wideAnd glide on out of hereYou deserve betterIt looms on the horizonDon't stop nowYou were so closeDon't give up nowDon't give up

You and I
Sometime last night I bought you a giftA boquet of poppies to ease our splitRed and whiteYou bring them inside and fill up a vaseI hide them from others in a safe placeIt's our secretOn a silver tray they bloom and they growBurning for a passion that you know too wellCrash to the floorCrash to the floorI scoop them up and hand them to youOnce they're in your own hands you know what to doEyes wide and whiteWe play a strange game with everyone elseI don't speak of you outside of the houseNobody knowsI know you so well we can't be apartBut having you with me is making life hardDead poppiesDead poppiesDead poppies

Implosion
Candy Canes and sugar plums dance in this childs headLeaving empty space behindWhile nightmares of silhouettes are filling up the voidIt's more than I can handle, more than I can beatThey're overrunning me from head to feetMy brick wall's crumbled, defenses are downTry not to make a soundThere's nothing left I won't doI'd even die for youDon't think i haven't triedTake me to the station nowPut me on a train and goLeave me to myselfI know tomorrow's going to be the same as todayThere's only one thing left to doFind the edge, walk the fine line, and hope you cross on throughEveryone stares as if it's some kind of gameNo one ever intervenesBut it's better that way, at least you knowYou're running your own showSo leave to my lonelinessJust walk by me and forgetThat we were ever closeDrink the sap of emptinessAnd just you remember thisDon't leave a job undoneOutside the sky is melting and running down the treesCoating everything in bluePeople laugh, and the devil cries, but all I can think of is youUp ahead in the tunnel I can see the lightLeading me to the endI can make it there, be free at lastDon't anyone step in

I'm So Sorry
Ahhhhh.... How dare youWhere were you when I needed you mostI fought the storm I summoned from withinAll alone,Fists held up highI was down so lowDown down down
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry I don't give a fuckIt's there insideWhere creation begins what it mustI was left here to write my own endingLeft by youPossessing what it takesTo find my own way out Down down down
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry I didn't give a fuckPast or presentWhere were you when I needed you mostBarren fields of painful thoughtFloating dreamsI couldn't ever reachWitheld from touchinst. inst inst.
spoken: "I don't ask for much"
inst...
inst...
inst...Why shouldn't IYou know just as well as everyone elseYou could have done so muchBut you didn'tThrough the rabbit holeDown the spiralDown down down
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry you were such a fuck
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry

It's Right
They all want you to knowEverything they knows bestFor you to do nowDon't make decisionsWithout their supervisionIt's what they say nowIt's not that you can't be yourselfBut you don't know howYou can't do
nowYou can't do what they say nowThey say "tell the truth now"The truth...truth... . . . .
.

.They all say they know you best soWho can you trust your secrets toThey know them all nowYou've shown them all nowThere's nowhere to hide nowWhen you tell the truthtruth, now, tell the truth, now, truth, now truth, now truth....It's all in the open for you to seeSeeing is believingAnd I believe you'll heal now,You told the truth nowtruth, now, tell the truth, now, truth, now truth, now truth....

Pearly Gates
Taken me on a trip through thick and thinWandering around here hand in handHappiness is fleetingTry and catch itHold it if you can, but not too hardIt's so fragileIt's so special with you in the roomCuz when you smile I see the pearly gatesYeah, I'm in heaven (echo) yeah, I'm in heaven...The last time you cried tears of happinessI can't recall what happiness isBut I know you'll lead me thereIt can't be far from hereI feel closeCloser than I've been beforeI'm nervous nowBut I've got you hereCuz when you smile I see the pearly gatesYeah, I'm in heaven
(echo) yeah, I'm in heaven...I haven't slept a wink for nightsI can't get you out of my headYour glued to my heartAnd I'm fine with itDon't lose sightI won't lose you without a fightFinders keepersI couldn't live withoutCuz when you smile I see the pearly gatesYeah, I'm in heaven
(echo) yeah, I'm in heaven...There's snow on the ground nowJust like the snow on my heartI'm praying for an indian summerA heavenly thawFor my icy tombJust let me see you smileAll I need is for you to show some loveJust smile for meCuz when you smile I see the pearly gatesYeah, I'm in heaven
(echo) yeah, I'm in heaven...Twilight fades itself through to dawnRaining sunlight in your hairAn awkward rising glareLive fast or die slowDrunk and aloneOn the highway of lifeBut two's better than oneTwo's not aloneCuz when you smile I see the pearly gatesYeah, I'm in heaven
(echo) yeah, I'm in heaven...
