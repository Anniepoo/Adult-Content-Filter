I’m in fairly serious need of cash so I’m looking to do some sketch commissions. 25€ a pop. Quality similar to the sketches you’ve seen me post. If that sounds like a deal you should hit me up at albatrosshf@hotmail.com !

Does the concept of std exist in your universe?
Not in the way of getting sick/dying. Potentially as a form of corruption, yeah.

I have a question
Are you black
And do you like black women
i noticed it on your art
Thanks for asking, anon. I try to mix it up as it keeps things spicy, you know. I like all blends. As for my skincolor? Mine is obviously gold ;)
