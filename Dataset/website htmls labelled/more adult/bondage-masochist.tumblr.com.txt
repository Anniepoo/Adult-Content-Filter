Wanted: Bondage Masochist
No experience necessary ⇒ will train ⇐ ~evil-grins~
The Goal; "I am left laying here, with no words to explain how satisfied I feel. He took me to places I've never been. Made me feel things I didn't know I could feel.
He got inside my mind and gave life to all of my desires, fantasies, and things I didn't know I craved or yearned for.
He transported me into his darkness; to a place I never want to leave, because there I am home and there I am completely free." ~ @MrsGrey4
The Stumbling Block; "My blogs are very private things that are open to everyone in the world, except; those who are really in my life." ~ unknown. ⇒  This is arguably true for the droves who are drawn into the Fifty-Shades-of-Grey pandemonium. Although I personally abhor what Fifty-Shades presents; I'm thrilled that droves of people are enthralled by its' dark sexual premise!
The Paradigm; "Everything in the world is about sex, except sex.
Sex is about power." ~ Oscar Wilde. ⇒ Consider it abusive power here, if you will, because; Fifty-Shades is clearly abuse! Worst, when they are apart and she must still prove her love for him!
But, even lovingly "abusive" sexual power cannot be sustained without extensive after-care, and, that is the difference between Fifty-Shades and sustainable BDSM partnerships. Further;
"The essence of sadomasochism is not so much "pain" as the overwhelming of one's senses — emotionally more than physically. Active sexual masochism has little to do with pain and everything to do with the search for emotional pleasure and, ultimately, satisfaction.
When we understand that it is pain only, and not cruelty, (that is the essential in this group of manifestations) we begin to come nearer to their explanation. The masochist desires to experience the sensations of pain, but she genuinely desires that it should be inflicted in love; the sadist desires to inflict pain, but he desires that it should be felt as love..." ~ Havelock Ellis via @mySlaveHeart [ and I edited it a little too ;-]
Respect is what is in play here, but you must understand that respect can coexist alongside consensual disrespect and pseudo abuse in a Ying & Yang way; He respects that she submits to this, and she respects that He is capable of doing this.
TO THE HATERS WHO ONLY SEE ABUSE HERE; trust that droves of people crave these scenes in a safe-sane-and-consensual way. Together; we ALL must stop true abuse ⇒ especially as depicted within Fifty-Shades!
It's sad that Fifty-Shades was written so selfishly *wrong*. ⇒ I pray that this blog can redeem that misconception a little because droves of people must entertain a dark sexuality, and that can be healthy, even if Fifty-Shades depiction isn't.
Zig Zigler famously said: "Punishment is what you do *to* someone.
Discipline is what you do *for* someone." ⇒ Ultimately; satisfaction is the goal for *both* — not regrets by either! To make this concept perfectly clear; sexual Domination is not about his pleasure & satisfaction, it's primarily about hers! The yin/yang duality of that Discipline is what makes their relationship sustainable.
Imho, sexual Discipline is what draws droves of people into the Fifty-Shades pandemonium.
So, here we are; savouring images of short-term sensual overload knowing that it will always be followed by hours and hours of blissful after-care between sensually unified souls.
Fwiw, I considered adding a blog for sappy after-care and princess play, but it felt too much like common after-sex TV scenes where one feels like they've been cheated out of something epic.
So, without further adieu; scroll down to see what I personally consider epic foreplay!
This blog is for ADULTS ONLY and NSFW ⇒ if you're under 18 and stay; note that your illegal Internet activity here is logged and may embarrass you and/or your parents in the near future.
Besides; Scarleteen is way cooler than watching your parents' foreplay here; click Scarleteen
Seriously; by scrolling down, you attest that you are at least 18 years of age, you will not expose minors to this material, and that you accept total liability for viewing and sharing this blog's material.
All pix herein come from a public posting, everyone depicted is presumed to be at least 18, and, everyone has presumably consented to the situation too. This blog does *NOT* condone criminal confinement/assault/rape!   Imho, a girl's submission is not about what is done to her; it's her selfless gift to others, with benefits. ;-)   If you own something here and want it removed; just ask.
Personally, I'm 53 years old and have been happily married for 24 years so far. Tumblr is the only place I'm openly, obsessively, compulsively, kinky, and, I'm not seeking extramarital sex partners — sorry — and; forgive me for corresponding as little as I do. Imho, it's cruel (in a bad way ;-) to plant seeds when I can't dedicate sufficient time to cultivate them properly.
I maintain seven NSFW blogs:
BDSM Wisdom ⇐ (archive)
Bondage Fetish ⇐ (archive)
Bondage Monger   ⇐   (ar)
Bondage Masochist ⇐ (ar)
Conflicted Cartoons ⇐ (ar)
Conflicted Cravings ⇐ (ar)
Discomfort Benefits ⇐ (ar)
==> If you're using a PC; be sure to check-out my awesome archives too!
Note; I can only follow your blog as wAustinmer. If you're vetting me; consider all seven of my blogs ~ William.
P.S. & Fwiw; I'm wAustinmer on Twitter also, but I'm not very active there; unless Tumblr is down..
Ask me anything

Thank you, Sir.
Lord Assburn was thrifty and devised these instead of nipple clamps😈
The chopsticks are also very effective for a girl who chatters too much…

I don’t know where you got the blackout lenses from.  I’d heard about them but never actually been able to find them.  Always a vendor who had gone out of business or discontinued the stock because of lack of demand.  Well, you apparently demanded. And when you slipped the case into my hand at Arrivals and sent me off to the private bathroom, it sure didn’t take long to figure out.
It was breathtaking from the start, even though I knew what was coming.  To see all the light fade from one eye and then steel myself to put the other in.  Trying to burn into my memory where the door was before it was all darkness.  Trying to remember how to get back to you by the baggage carousel.  But when I (finally) found my way to the door and opened it, I felt your hand slip into mine.  "Now remind me, what color is your bag?“
My steps were hesitant at first – unsure and shaky.  Following is hard, you know?  But you learn to read the signals, all the more quickly when you’re truly desperate for them.  Soon enough you didn’t even have to slow down when you led me through the crowded, jumbled restaurant.  The waitress was so amused when you pulled out my chair – at least I think she was.  What do I know?
It reminded me in so many ways of our first dance together.  Me, all nervous and clumsy and thinking too hard about how to move and when.  And your strong hands and strong arms and strong body framing mine, your whispers into me ear to just relax and let you lead, to just trust where you’re taking my body and stop second-guessing it.
I learned what the sun feels like that weekend.  Really what it feels like.  What grass feels like and wood floors feel like under bare feet… and under a bare cheekbone.  I learned how to be still and not check the directions.  Sure as fuck learned how to live without my phone.
I’m still not sure what you did to me… saying that it was all a blur would be too much of a pun.  I felt you adorn me with the things you had made, I felt the soft press of a marker to my skin… and sometimes in such visible places!  What did you write?  Did you write anything?  Was it all just a mindgame?  I don’t know what you fucked me with.  Don’t know what you put in my mouth.  Well, some of it I know… some of those tastes I’m familiar with.  It’s mostly a mystery.  Not sure all those places I knelt or sat by your feet or laid my head in your lap.  Not sure who I met or who it was that we spend those long hours with.  Not sure who knew and who wondered at my sudden reticence and reserve, so uncharacteristic to me.
Really not sure, that one night, if it was just your two hands on me… sometimes it felt like they missed your callouses and broad palms.
I do wish I’d gotten to see you again before you walked me back to that private bathroom, this time at Departures.  But a squeeze, a hug, that deep kiss, and “you know the way from here, boy”, and that was it.
And now all I can do is stare at that stuffed envelope leering at me from my bag and wonder if I want to know what you did to me… or just close my eyes again and drop it in the trash.

I love the position Martin put me in this night.  I was wearing black stockings, red, pointy-toe heels, and a two-piece, red lacy lingerie with garters and stockings.  The bra even had sexy slits down the middle, perfect for accessing my nipples.  He put me in an ankles crossed, kneeling position with my hands tied above my head.  My mouth was gagged with a sexy red, 2" ball, and my throat was roped and pulled to my ankles.  No more than a couple minutes later I was unable to handle to position.  Kicking my heels off and trying to lift my ankles off the pallet to relieve the rope around my neck.  Martin was f0rced to change the tie… no worries… this time he anchors both knees to the base - spread wide, ropes a pony tail to my ankles and slides a dildo mounted on a pole deep inside me.  Those were the consequences.  www.AsianaStarr.com
