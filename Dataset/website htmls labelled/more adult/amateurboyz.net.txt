Show More Information
As Amateur Parties was the first parties in Athens which began outgrow their roots and branch out around the city, their DIY attitude led them to explore uncharted territories of the Athenian club scene, taking their varied, energetic sound to ironic, slightly seedy yet decedent but generally overlooked venues such as the “Meteorit” Russian Disco, the “Arena” Polish Club, the “BG” Bulgarian Disco ex-strip club and porn cinema, and the exotic tourist disco “Lavabore”. This kooky thinking ultimately became a huge hit with people who just wanna have fun and dance the nite away.
The success of their parties allowed the ‘boyz’ to introduce the Athenian crowd to international guest DJs and producers such as In Flagranti, Joakim, Eric Duncan of Rub N Tug & Still Going, Rory Phillips, Jacques Renault, Dj Kaos, Rebolledo, Psychemagik, Baris K to name but a few.
Alongside their own parties, have also organized live showcases, presenting acts such as the first appearance in Athens of AIDS-3D in a live performance, Rodion, Don Cash, Yacht, and special collaborations like special performance by Black Meteoric Star (Gavin Russom) and assume vivid astro focus. These artists transformed bios(athens) into a new audio-visual landscape, bringing you along on an ecstatic journey through the night
The “boyz” also found time to involve themselves in projects such as Terence Koh’s performance piece at Destroy Athens – the First Athens Biennial (2007) and one of his latest project “lightning striking at both ends of a thought”,  Diesel’s xXx party in Athens, special events such as the Athenian Peres Projects Gallery party, the Launch party of the International Designer Angelos Frentzos, collaborations with artist as Katerina Kana, SOUTH Magazine Launch and Opening of Exhibition Party with Cibelle and to play alongside Horse Meat Disco and Juan Mclean/Poni Hoax
Last years they were running ENCORE party series (ENCORE I ,ENCORE II,ENCORE III,ENCORE IV…..) and one of the most successful nites in Athens ALPHABETALAMDA, this fraternity hosted the freshest underground music nights in Athens, with international special guests – Pet Shop Bears, Neville Watson, Daniel Wang, Psychemagik, Bill Brewster, Hunee Sean P and more – performing alongside hot local DJs.
Along with the boyz the most influential party teams around “OUTRO”, “TROUBLE”, the Berlin-based “pEt sHOp bEARs”, and “JOHN” Melbourne’s hottest party was just some of the outfits already lined up.
