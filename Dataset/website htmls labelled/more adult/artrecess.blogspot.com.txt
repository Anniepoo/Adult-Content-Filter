#555
Wood-floored bar on Rue St. Catharine—
you danced, I sat, soused as Herod,
sipped vodka tonic, endless bland
medley belting out of the jukebox—
you smiling, I occupied keeping you happy,
un-frazzled— suddenly sounds behind us,
the bar wasn’t crowded & a patron
(rakish, whisker-flecked big mouth)
lifted a forefinger at beer-bellied
bartender bitching back, soon a real
fight, violence in quiet midnight,
I, scared, got you out of there
but you had to dance, you said,
had to dance so we paved Plateau, tense steps,
found nothing, you started crying & stamping
your feet like a child, I grabbed you & dragged
you back to our room you stripped, curled
into fetal position, beat your fists against
the mattress, in this way you danced
through the night, dozed & woke ready for more—

The father’s gaze
(depending which gaze
you happen to be
referring to) is panoptic.
It goes in without
leaving traces. So if you
have several fathers that
leave no traces, &
merely invisible gazes,
there is or maybe a
sense in which you have
no fathers. I saw
all this happening to me,
along with every
thing else, many years ago, before I could
visualize the cell I was
in, before I knew
how the walls stank of
fresh paint, or saw
that I was getting
smeared at any juncture.
But, as I saw this, my
father who was my
father turned, spoke down
to me in such
a way that I listened. I
took what he said,
gazed at my cell, and
watched the paint dry
deep into the night
before I busted out to
watch the dawn break over
the Delaware.
#1603
“Be careful what you handle,”
I told her, “you can get to me
even if you touch another,” it
happened in an office shaped
like the foyer of a huge hovel,
built of mud, etchings of bugs
on the wall, perfect perverse
kids scampering among clods.
“You know what I want, and
how I can get it,” she replied,
as she took another out, put
me in, but only inside a brain
used amiss to find a level that,
shaped like a foyer, was past
office, into brick, sans mud.
#1607
Every live body has a dialect:
to the extent that bodies are
in the process of effacing both
themselves, what they efface, I
move past dialect to the extent
that there are no no-brainers
here, what’s moral in this is the
belief that properly used dialects
emanate waves to hold bodies
in place. As to who’s saying this,
I heard this on the street last
night after a few drinks with
an ex at Dirty Frank’s. It was
a bum who meant it, it worked.
#1613
Follow Abraham up the hill:
to the extent that the hill is
constituted already by kinds
of knives, to what extent can
a man go up a hill, shepherd
a son to be sacrificed, to be
worthy before an almighty
power that may or may not
have had conscious intentions
where hills, knives, sons were
concerned, but how, as I watch
this, can I not feel that Abraham,
by braving knives, does not need
the one he holds in his rapt hands?

Aaron Belz (Los Angeles, USA): Two Poems
FAMOUS This morning the universedivulged its secret: “There is no huggy bear.”Then the universe
sat for a momentas if in deep thought. “Rather, huggy bear is ill and about to die.” The universe stood up and shrugged. “I guess you just do the best you can, right?” No, I thought. That can’t be right.
There must be a back doorto get out of this place. Then I developed kaleidoscopic vision. Everything became multiplied and divided, and it was slowly turning. This must be how
Bonosees the world, I thought.
SHE TAUGHT US To avoid certain phrases, such as “like the plague,”but how desperately were we to avoid them? She had deprived herself of a way to express this. “O bubonic plague, bubonic, bubonic. Nothing elseis as bubonic as you!” began one of my essays,for nothing was, until you came along, my dear. You proved even more bubonic than the plague,so I avoided you like the blague—that is to say,like the joke, trick, or blunder. It’s a French word.
Kelley White (New Hampshire, USA): from Salt Suite
SALT SUITE I: That Moment We Say Yes to the Water my good hand an oar my hair a whisper of torn sail he offered to wash the sand from my feet one white feather as if a bowl of fresh water could keep us safe from the sea death’s breath breathing water to hold all that stiff salt anger like a phone call about an angry tooth is it always our mother forcing us to breathe? and what are sobs but hunger? and when the mother comes to lift the shoulders to make a cup of her chest now that you can see a little light what have you brought up from the bottom? the man with the puffed pink scars down his chest? iron feathers? what living water? SALT SUITE II: It Takes a Long Time to Get Past a House I’d like a jar without sides I’d like an empty skate one broken egg, womb warm “It was the way she welcomed the water, her thirst, eyes open, gulping great mouth fulls even as she pushed beneath the skin and let the it cover her face, willful, her drunk exhausted arms, that was the shock, to see her swallow death, to suck at death’s breast. . .” (who did this thing? sinking flowers in the sand? the stones know where it is safe to lie) I’d like an angry shovel an abandoned umbrella I’d like a painted stone SALT SUITE III: A Painted Stone 1. she drank, her body face up and staring that heavy hair floating to hold all that stiff salt anger the stones know where it is safe to lie 2.
if I led you to the water, if I eased you in, back against the tide, would you trust me to keep you breathing? would I trust you to breathe? 3. death’s breath not breathing water as if a bowl of fresh water could keep us safe from the sea
Jeffrey Side (UK): The Semantic Limitations of Visual Poetry
In The Reader, the Text, the Poem, Louise Rosenblatt says: ‘The poem, then, must be thought of as an event in time. It is not an object or an ideal entity. It happens during a coming-together, a co-penetration, of a reader and a text’.
She later elaborates:
The reading of a text is an event occurring at a particular time in a particular environment at a particular moment in the life history of the reader. The transaction will involve not only the past experience but also the present state and present interests or preoccupations of the reader. This suggests the possibility that printed marks on a page may even become different linguistic symbols by virtue of transactions with different readers. Just as knowing is the process linking a knower and a known, so a poem should not be thought of as an object, an entity, but rather as an active process lived through during the relationship between a reader and a text.
For the poem to be experienced as an event in time, the importance of mental activity, or “internalisation”, in the reader cannot be overestimated. By internalisation I mean that part of the reader’s response that is able, through conscious decision, to minimise the relevance of the text in the hermeneutical process.
This is difficult to achieve with poetry in which the artifice (in the form of certain extra-lexical ingredients—such as the visual and acoustic) is fore-grounded at the expense of semantic elements. Such poetry inhibits internalisation and is, as Charles Bernstein has said, ‘concerned only with representing its own mechanisms’.
These elements of artifice are, like painting and music, non-semantic and, as such, they preclude an exegetical response that is distinct from the hermeneutical procedures employed in the reception of non-representational visual art and music. In ‘The Dollar Value of Poetry’ Charles Bernstein advocates a poetics that is grounded in experiences that are released in the reading. In this sense, then, poetry is seen as being untranslatable and un-paraphrasable for ‘what is untranslatable is the sum of all the specific conditions of the experience (place, time, order, light, mood, position, to infinity) made available by reading’.
Bernstein sees this untranslatability as being misunderstood by advocates of ‘certain “concretist” tendencies, who see in radical concrete procedures the manifestation of untranslatability at its fullest flowering’.
As Bernstein, stresses ‘what is not translatable is the experience released in the reading’.
He goes on to say that ‘in so far as some “visual poems” move toward making the understanding independent of the language it is written in, i.e., no longer requiring translation, they are, indeed, no longer so much writing as works of visual art. In ‘Words and Pictures’, he emphasises the linguistic and semantic criteria necessary for any aesthetic of viewer/reception theory to be plausible: ‘visual experience is only validated when accompanied by a logico-verbal explanation’.
For Bernstein, then, as he says in ‘Thought’s Measure’, ‘there is meaning only in terms of language’.
Furthermore, he is well aware of the dangers of too much foregrounding of artifice when he writes in ‘Artifice of Absorption’:
In my poems, Ifrequently use opaque & nonabsorbableelements, digressions &interruptions, as part of a technologicalarsenal to create a more powerful(“souped up”)absorption than possible with traditional,& blander, absorptive techniques. This is aprecarious road because insofaras the poem seemsovertly self conscious, as opposed to internallyincantatory or psychicallyactual, it may produceself consciousness in the reader in such a way as todestroy his or her absorption by theatricalizingor conceptualizing the text, removingit from the realm of an experience engenderedto that of a techniqueexhibited.
Bernstein welcomes internalisation. Without it, it is impossible for poetry to be experienced as an event in time. However, he does tend to view the semantic field as incorporating non-lexical features of a poem.
While I agree with incorporation in principle, in practice it is psychologically problematical for most readers. This is perhaps why such poetry is deemed “difficult”.
It could be argued that visual poetry is, indeed, semantic. I agree to an extent. For instance, Ernst Gomringer’s ‘WIND’ (which plays with associations such as the words "in" and “win” contained within the word "WIND”) and Augusto de Campos's ‘CODIGO’ (which contains the word "God" as an anagram and alludes to "cogito ergo sum”) do, indeed, operate semantically. Nevertheless, their semantic operations are extremely meagre. With ‘WIND’ the associations come to only two words: “win” and “in” (perhaps also the word “wind”, as in to wind a clock). The same limitations can be seen in de Campos's ‘CODIGO’. Apart from a reader’s fleeting appreciation of the novel aspects of these poems their affects are exhausted no sooner than they are recognised.
In contrast, if we compare the following lines from ‘Into the Day’ by J. H. Prynne with ‘WIND’ and ‘CODIGO’ we can see their limitations more clearly:
Who does we reign our royal house is roofed with fateful slates
These lines begin with the words ‘who does’ which immediately puts us into questioning mode, but the next word, ‘we’, draws our attention to the grammatical inappropriateness of the preceding word, ‘does’, in its location between ‘who’ and ‘we’. We have been led to expect a question but the grammatically incorrect syntax has frustrated this expectation. We are left instead with a language that rather than denoting a position of enquiry relies, instead, on connotation for this effect. This sort of “question” belongs to an "enquiry" that is syntactical rather than referential. In other words it is language pretending to be a question.
Similarly, ‘our royal house is roofed with fateful slates’ although syntactically correct contain the juxtaposition of ‘fateful’ with ‘slates’, two words not usually associated or combined with each other. This cannot be said of ‘roofed’ and ‘slate’ which often share the same juxtaposition. If the word ‘fateful’ had not been included there would be little room for plurality of meaning. The word ‘slates’ would mean solely roofing materials. It is the juxtaposition of ‘fateful’ and ‘slates’ that produces the plurality. A few of the dictionary definitions of the word ‘slate’ are: 1) a fine-grained rock that can be easily split into thin layers and is used as a roofing material. 2) a roofing tile of slate. 3) a writing tablet of slate. 4) a dark grey colour. 5) a list of candidates in an election. ‘Slate’ is, thus, rich in connotation. The addition of ‘fateful’ enables any one of these meanings to become appropriate. For example, it is quite possible to have a fateful dark grey colour—as in the sense of an omen. So, too, is it possible to have a fateful group of electoral candidates.
If we were to choose this latter image for one of the meanings of ‘fateful slates’ we could make it fit into the rest of the sentence (if it can rightly be called one) by opening up the meanings of ‘our royal house is roofed with’. This is fairly simple, as the idea of electoral candidates enables ‘royal house’ to connote a political arena of some sort as suggested by the word ‘house’ (The Houses of Parliament or The White House, for example). The word ‘roofed’ connotes a ‘covering-over’—a protection of some sort, as in the image of a bird’s wing covering and protecting its young. If we take this as our connotation, then one of the many meanings of ‘our royal house is roofed with fateful slates’ could be: ‘Our political system is protected from tyranny by its processes of electing political candidates who are under oath (fated) to guarantee this freedom from tyranny’. This interpretation of Prynne's 12 words is only possible with a richer semantic field of possibilities than both ‘WIND’ and ‘CODIGO’ provide.
The formal qualities of a poem are, of course, important but only indirectly: in that they facilitate the inner ear’s appreciation of the poem’s sonorous qualities. They do not contribute overmuch semantically. The only thing of importance is the mental activity experienced by the reader. The reader’s attention should not be focused on the poem’s structure or its rhetorical devices but, rather, should be concentrated on the resonance produced by the semantic qualities of the lexis. Only in this way, then, can the poem be fully experienced as mental activity. It must be remembered that a poem is primarily “heard” in the mind. All that we are able to glean from a poem is conveyed through the poems semantic operation. To argue that the formal qualities of the text facilitate a more than limited semantic response is to rely too heavily on an aesthetic theory that is more appropriate to the visual arts.

Rosenblatt, pp. 20-21.
Rosenblatt’s attitude to the relevance of the text can be seen in the following quotation where she comments on the titles of literary works: ‘But when we try to think of what a title—Hamlet, say, or Moby Dick—might refer to apart from a reader, whether the author himself or another, “the work” disappears. The title then refers simply to a set of black marks on ordered pages or to a set of sounds vibrating in the air, waiting for some reader or listener to interpret them as verbal symbols and, under their guidance, to make a work of art, the poem or novel or play’.

THE CONSTIPATION SWEATERWhat if all of my interactions with others are a figment of my imaginationand I’m actually completely insaneis kind of an unsettling thought I had one dayso I wrote to youlately I’ve been struggling with realityand put reality in quotes to emphasize the struggle but I didn’t think struggle was the right sentimentso I looked in a thesaurus but couldn’t find a better word but did find give the old college tryand triedto understand what that really means, the old college try,but I don’t know if college was really real for meor if all of my interactions with others were a figment of my imaginationand I was completely insaneis what you would’ve heard from me that dayif I hadn’t thrown the note away before giving it to youbecause I was afraid you’d think I was completely insaneis something you should never sayto the meat department staff at your neighborhood Dominick’sbecause they’ll think you’re completely insaneexcept for the really old guy who can’t hear anything,he’ll keep yelling what, whatand you’ll end up in a situation where you’re yelling all this to himand others around you will think you’re completely insane and the point hereis to keep this insanity thing kind of on the down lowbecause you’ve spent time in the hospital and you don’t want to spend time in the hospitalbecause it’s so lonely and the gowns are so uncomfortable and the foodis so averagebut mostly it’s so lonely,the way nurses interrupt your sleep at night to replace your IV,the way nurses wake you in the morning to take your blood,the way the morning lasts forever and the hospital staffplaces you in front of cartoons as if that's enough to get you through the daybut it’s completely maddeningand I’m so sorry for everything I’ve ever done that’s hurt youbecause I didn’t mean tois what I wanted to say that nightI returned from the hospitaland we ate dinner togetherand watched Primer for the fifth timebut instead I asked if the nurse who joked about taking my temperature rectally was flirting with me,I washed the dishes and wrote The Constipation Sweater, about a sweateryou can wear that helps facilitate defecation.PHOENIX VERSUS THE FLYING CHICKENIf all this is happening on an infinite number of parallel membranesand my life exists separately within each of those parallel membranesthen perhaps some of those existences occasionally transcend membranesthrough some type of telekinetic wormhole and find their way into my dreamsand I’ve actually been violently chopped in some of those existencesor my cats are not alive in some of those existencesor I died in a gruesome airline disaster above Mexico Cityin March 2006in some of those existenceswhich before that time I’d feared was my death dreamand after that time decided was about how my girlfriend can sleep through anythingis something most people don’t imagineother people are thinking as they whip through Dominick’son their way home from work each night—most people are rocking out to Yes’s Owner of a Lonely Heart, buying tampons and peanut butter cups—is something I hope to communicate to other me’s who’ve never had this thought on all those parallel membranes out thereis another example of something I should really try to keep on the down low because others may interpret it as insaneis a thought I had one night as I whipped through Dominick’srocking out to Owner of a Lonely Heart, buying tampons and pbc’s but the more intense part of the thought I had waswhat if everyone in this place is having this exact same thoughtand it’s what Trevor Rabin was thinking when he wrote Owner of a Lonely Heartand what if all the other me’s on all those parallel membranes have already dreamt what I’m thinkingbut it didn’t make any fucking sense to thembecause those me’s strayed from the me who’s herein Dominick’s right now due to decisions they made I wish I’d madethat guided their lives to completely different placeswhere they have tampons and peanut butter cups but they’ve never heardof Dominick’s because they only have Penny Saver’s wherever they areand they spend their days with refugees from war torn regions,educating themor nursing them back to good healthand they wonder if those they educate or nurse back to good health ever wonderif all this is happening on an infinite number of parallel membranesand their lives exist separately within each of those parallel membranesthen perhaps some of those existences occasionally transcend membranesthrough some type of telekinetic wormholeand find their way into their dreamsbecause it might explain the meaning of the dream they had Dominick versus the tampon cup the same way it might explain the meaning of my dream phoenix versus the flying chicken.THE NIGHT OF THE JAGUARLet’s say this emerges centuries from now in some type of post-apocalypticDumont Dunes hellscape,people are either going to be blasting around from membrane to membrane impressed with my forward thinkingor not blasting around from membrane to membraneamazed by my total insanityand I expect the latteris what most people at this point expect me to say to someoneat my neighborhood Dominick’sbecause I don’t do very wellwith keeping this insanity thing on the down low but it’s not something most people expect me to say to the puddingat my neighborhood Dominick’sand the reason I think the latter is because come on,if you’re living in some type of post-apocalyptic Dumont Dunes hellscapelogic would dictate that earth has regressedfrom where it is nowunless the educational divide has become so extremethat the highly educated have wormholed their way to more tolerable parallel membranesand left this post-apocalyptic Dumont Dunes hellscape to those of us who enjoy tearing into a good piece of meat with our handsand pleading to our faithful squadron tobring us the head of Orpheus the Mightyfor the Night of the Jaguar is upon usand blood will surely flowred like the river Hades through this long ago forsaken hellscapein which casedescendents, I salute thee!is something we’ve all thought about at some pointas we whipped through Dominick’s on our way home from work at night,but how many of us have outlinedeverything we have in common with the jaguaron the back of our grocery listsin the hope that we might be reveredin the chance this future outcome happens? Here’s mine:We are both solitary, stalk-and-ambush predators.We are both opportunistic in prey selection.We both bite directly through the skull of our prey.We both enjoy swimming.We both range from Paraguay to México.We are both compact and well-muscled, with robust heads and powerful jaws.We both reach sexual maturity at three to four years of age.We both practice aggression avoidance behavior.We are both the national animal of Guyana. Of course it’d be ridiculous for me to want to be worshipped for this type of forward thinkingbut I think revered would be nicebut I don’t know, in this scenario there’s probably nota lot of reading going onbut instead a lot of heat and blood and dunes and filth and false idolatrybut the good news is if someone does read this,I’m not going to seem totally insanebecause the Night of the Jaguar is upon us, my brethren,and blood is about to flow red like the river Hades, red like the river Hadesas you go forth and bring me the head of Orpheus the Mighty!© Jason Bredle 2009
Jean Vengua (California, USA): Three Prose Poems
#1what do you think. half sleepy, once again on the other side of pain, ad nauseum, etc. she thinks about the angry blooms. how they emerge with such force, and with a little careful coaxing they give up black pollen. upended like that. turning volatile inside out, she can’t figure it. wants to sew it up tight with a needle and thread; wants a beginning and an end. she has a body and expects it to tell tales. a tale of a prehensile tail. well what does it have to say for itself? from which joint or talon or lip or tongue issues word? half a word. half a moan, then, in exchange for some tender strokes.#2a blossoming non-pain along the elbow, even to the shoulder. pain of short shrift and some dribbles of light, and there among the curved rafters under the breasts. soft containment, the flesh thinning with age. sometimes turning the tongue on a word. nipples that are concise, small territories, templed; and these, once dark, that have paled and lost their boundaries. shift shift click. the knee dreams of fluffy pews. the back of the neck dreaming of ice. the tongue dreaming of ribs. stretch marks pay tributary to the navel, a locked door, both sides. where once there was a vortex of blood, there are a few paths narrowing to a stop.#3she feels old. can’t understand she’s beautiful, even naked, plastered in signs and executed like once-perfect britney. “nudity is not a crime.” even when perfectly wet or close up, each hair is an aging fold, a suzanne, or a polly jean in the tub. the aesthetics speak imperfect and fleshy nouns. English wants to be precise. to be indirect is the best prescription. (sigh) i can’t stand these colors. the colors of autumn are electric collars for your gender. this muscle is a girdle that contains all erotics; although your erotics are not my erotics, we may meet in the middle (joined at the navel, so to speak). look: language falls down around my ankles, so revealing.© Jean Vengua 2009

What’s this about making
moves, said
the apprentice? I’ve got
irons in the fire
with all these pieces,
isn’t that enough?
To have mastered how the
fire works,
so that each piece burns
right down: it’s
not the only move that
matters, but as
I just made a line of
rooks rather than
pawns, what else could
possibly get my
goat? The master heard
this, appearing
limber, but quite chained
to the voices
that were taking away the
tools he used
to put his apprentices in
their places. I
have nothing to say about
this, he said,
as he wiped beads of
sweat from a brow
that furrowed so
intensely that all his
enemies insisted he had
dark ties. Just
make rows of rooks
instead of pawns,
and you will find
yourselves kings and
queens. They all left him
that night, after
dumping the ashes in a
river that ran in
back of the workshop,
into a black sea.
