About
32 year old fuck toy. NSFW, Adults only, if you're not old enough get off my blog. Just another slut :). Let me be clear though, this blog is not condoning any non-consensual acts, and the only images I own, or am responsible for are the ones I post of myself which can be found on their own section or searching the tag me on my page.

Do a good job and I’ll consider giving you a second chance.  Piss me off again and I bury the rest of you.  Now open your mouth, whore.

violent-rape-fantasies:
You scream at first because the water’s ice-cold.  But then your screams turn into desperation when you see me turn around and leave with the water left running.
“I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.”
Frank Herbert - Dune
