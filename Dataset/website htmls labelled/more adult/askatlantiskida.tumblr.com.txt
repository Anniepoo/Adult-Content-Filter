Had she looked any closer, she would have noticed the giggling rafters…or perhaps she wouldn;t have. The specter knew how to stay well-hidden, as humans were always skeptical of his existence anyway…he merely fed them what their eyes pleasured in seeing, which was normality. Except at night. Humans reasoned that night-time was always for the supernatural, and they attributed his actions to mere delusion, paranoia, or blantant hallucinations.
“Night falls, my victim…and soon you will fall within its grasp…”
The specter chuckled at the notion, as sunset was already close to occurring.
her eyes widened as she was lifted off the ground. “t-this is a dream..i- need to wake up. she held onto her bunny, whimpering softly.”j-just a d-dream. j-j-just a dream…just a dream..”
Kamukura levitated her ever higher, grinning giddily as he envisioned the shrieks that would soon issue from her mouth.
“Oh, this is no dream…just admit it.”
And he plunged his arms downward, sending her into a freefall. At the last moment, he reactivated the levitation, floating her an inch from the ground before collision.
“Could you possibly dream that?”
she looked down, shaking before her eyes rolled back, fainting out of shock and fear
