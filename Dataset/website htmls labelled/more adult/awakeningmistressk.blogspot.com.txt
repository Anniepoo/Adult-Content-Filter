Valentine's Day Submission
Ah,Valentine's Day. Usually the day that couples go out and have a nice dinner, profess their love by sharing chocolate or roses and then hook up.
Yes, that is a generic look at V-Day however it stands for most people. This year one big difference is many couples decided to take in 50 Shades of Grey. A Twilight fan-fiction with BDSM sex scenes and real abuse/stalker issues.
Not a good depiction of BDSM at all! That is why my slave and I will refuse to see it and throw money at a show that depicts our lifestyle in a negative light.
I decided we would have a calm, relaxing day at home together. No worries, no stress. Just the two of us all day. I informed my wife of my plan and she agreed. I mentioned it would likely be BDSM themed and she agreed readily.
As morning came my slave jumped out of bed and locked her collar on around her neck as if it was second nature.
After we enjoyed a light breakfast I told my slave to get dressed in a way that would be pleasing to me.
While she prepared for the day I was busy tending to the fireplace getting it nice and warm in our living room. I looked to the stairs as I heard the click of her 5 inch black heels that she knows turns me on so easily. As she came down the stairs I took it all in from top to bottom. Wet hair which she knows I find to be highly arousing, a red see thru shirt that showed off her breasts and nipples just right, red and black lacy panties, a garter belt, black thigh highs, and the heels. Of course her collar was locked back on after her shower.
She was the vision of perfection. She immediately would kneel before me and hand over the leash to her collar for my hands. She looked down and spoke ever so softly "Sir, slave has 3 humble requests".
This submissive attitude was intoxicating to me. She was submissive from the start of the day and was falling deeper into it without thinking. She was falling into a form of subspace!
The first two questions were general house keeping type thoughts for the day. That third question though. "Will Sir turn off the fingerprint on slave's phone and change the password for today so I concentrate on you and your pleasure all day?" My, my, my. K had fallen deep into subspace.
I of course obliged her request without batting an eye.
We lounged in front of that fire, watching a TV show(If you must know House of Cards), her legs spread and hands resting on her thighs the whole time. I toyed with her breasts. With my property between her legs. Building her arousal.
After an episode ended I had her stand up and proceeded to use our newly bought rope to do our first rope bondage harness(Found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUsznt8qNgE ). The effects were almost immediate. The moment I touched her breast and nipple she was highly sensitive after the rope was tied in place.
We sat back down watching yet another episode, the whole time I toyed with her breasts and nipples,causing her to squirm and whimper. Finally, as the episode ended she spoke.
"Would it please Sir to take me right here on the floor?"
"Why yes it would slave. Do you want me to take you right here?" As I asked I stroked a breast yet again. She shuddered and then nodded her head.
"Right here, in front of the fire."
As you can imagine it was quite the romantic end to a perfect day.
One massive take away. She loved the rope and wants more as soon as possible. Probably tonight ;-).

An Orgasm a Day.
My wife used to be quite an orgasmic woman.
In those formative years when people experiment with themselves my darling slave experimented quite a bit.
Yet somehow in the years after that exploration and marriage she went from an orgasm a day to 2-3 a week. Quite a difference!
The hope when she was the Mistress was that we would get back to the 1 orgasm a day she used to feel when she was exploring.
Even at the height of her control I could not achieve the desired effect of 1 orgasm a day.
Yet, now with my dominance it is so clear how to get to 1 orgasm a day. Starting tomorrow my slave will be required to orgasm every single day. Quite often I hope to include a lot of intimacy in this however even if she is not fully in the mood she will orgasm every single day because it pleases me.
Thankfully we have the Magic Wand. With that little device she will be able to orgasm every single day within 5-10 minutes even if she is not initially aroused.
She agreed to this readily even though she realizes that she will not always be horny and in the mood for an orgasm.
She wants to achieve a level of sexuality with me that she hasn't achieved before. A required orgasm a day is the best way to it.
Let's see how the first week goes, shall we? ;-)

The Fabled Morning Sex
My slave is often times hard to arouse in the morning. She and I both are not what you would consider morning people in general however for her it is quite noticeable.
Thoughts of arousal are often dimmed by desire for food or to get about starting her day. A totally understandable belief however waking up with a raging erection essentially every day does not make me inclined to not try for some 'fun' between the sheets when I first rise.
That being said from time to time she will wake with desire in the morning. I would say half of those times after some mild petting it is usually agreed to eat breakfast before continuing.
The day after the Magic Wand arrived was a different experience entirely. We laid in bed talking. I ran my fingernails along her arm. Back and forth, gently.
Back and forth up and down her arm. We talked small talk. How each other slept, what our plans for the day were. Things of that nature. All the while my nails running back and forth across her skin just along her left arm. I went all around her arm, raking my nails gently but just firm enough so she could feel me on every inch of her skin.
Our conversation wound down and I found myself getting ready to stand up. My slave did not move though.Well, let me rephrase. She clutched at me and gently began to writhe against my leg.
My slave was primed.
She wanted an orgasm.
She needed an orgasm.
Now, my wife hasn't always been found of bondage. Don't get me wrong she likes a blindfold and tease with her hands tied in such a way as she can scratch an itch or move a bit if she wanted to. But the idea of her hands spread apart unable to move? Usually too much for her and would just kill any scene.
I asked her if she wanted to cum.
Her response was to look down from my eyes and nod her head softly.
I smiled softly and spoke gently"The only way I will allow you to cum is if you are tied up and blindfolded."
She pouted and thought for a moment. Of course by this time I had teased her just a bit more and I knew she wanted this orgasm badly.
She nodded her head softly as she looked at me. I smirked a bit and shook mine. "Ask me."
She looked down, part nerves part her mind wrapping her head around the fact that she wanted to submit I assume.
"Will Sir please tie and blindfold me so that I may orgasm?"
"Yes slave. I will."
Now I had not intended to fuck her right then and there. I figured I could get her off a few times and then we could go about our day with her fucking to be saved for that night.
As she laid there, arms spread wide and tied to the headboard. Her eyes blindfolded. Her nude form writhing against her bondage as I pressed that Magic Wand against her clit until she came I knew I had to take her.
I will let your imagination fill in the blanks here ;-)
Until next time.

The Magic Wand
My wife has always been a bit anxious trying new things in a sexual sense. Stepping outside her comfort zone has always been slowly and with baby steps.
I recall once being in a sex shop with her and looking at the myriad of vibrators we could have bought. I remember having to convince her that buying one with a built in 'rabbit' was the way to go for some great sexual release.
I remember her asking me what "this sorcery" was when the rabbit ears touched her clit for the very first time.
Much of our sexual exploration has been slow, some nervous tension, and then amazing results. Another example is when she was nervous of mounting my face however once that dildo gag was in my mouth she rode herself to a quick and mind numbing orgasm.
Well the other day someone on twitter recommended I get a Magic Wand. I knew of the device and I was already tempted to purchase one. You see we have 180 feet of bondage rope enroute and I saw some pretty interesting looking harnesses with that very vibrator in mind. But I just didn't know if it would be too intense for my slave.
@PropertyofSir on twitter assured me it would be the best decision I made to buy one. With that in mind, and my already large desire to have this for a bondage harness, I purchased it on Friday.
Well, Amazon works fast! I had it in hand Saturday night. I tested it out a bit on myself and I must say the feeling of it on my shaft, for the briefest of moments, was divine. I knew that my slave would be hooked.
My initial plan was to blindfold her and then surprise her with the device. However plans are not always easy to keep. I started to feel sick so I laid on the bed and relaxed. My slave came home and saw the wand and was instantly curious.
She e-mailed me, as is custom upon first waking up and before going to sleep, and told me she was excited to try the wand.
I happened to wake up and read the e-mail before she went to sleep. I looked her in the eyesand asked "Maybe I should wand you right now. Would you like that?"
She immediately averted her gaze from my eyes and squirmed in the bed some yet she did no answer me in the negative or affirmative.
I tilted her chin up so she would look me in the eyes again. "Slave?"
A small, imperceptible nod was my only answer. It was the only one I needed. As I leaned over to plug the wand into the outlet I directed her to pull her sleep pants down and to present.
Definition time! Present is the term I use when I want her to spread her legs for me. When she is standing she spreads her legs and places her hands behind her back. When she is laying on the bed her legs are spread wide and hands are placed on her thighs, so close to being able to touch my property however unable to do so without permission.
By the time I rolled back over she was presented and waiting. I placed the wand to her clit and turned it on low. The effects were almost immediate. Her breathing got heavier, her hips began to gyrate, her body began to respond.
As her eyes fluttered shut and her lips quivered I upped the speed to the high setting. Her muscles clenched, she groaned and in under 5 minutes she came. Within 10 she had two full orgasms.
She even began to giggle for no apparent reason. I am assuming the tension release was great.
Suffice it to say I can not wait to erect a harness to keep the wand in place for hours.
I wonder how long she could last.
How long should I make her last?

How Mistress K Lost Control
When my wife first gave me those submissive eyes that Master's and Mistress's know all too well. That same look that I had given her more times than I can count over the last 3 years. I knew I had to snatch the opportunity presented.
My wife was getting stressed by her work commitments and every day life. She was feeling anxious about everything including dominating me at home.
It was all so much. How could she handle all the stress without something giving? She couldn't. No one could.
I convinced her that she needed to cede control to me in order to allow me to help quell her stress and anxiety.
She agreed.
This happened very early in December.  Since then she has had a choice. She could either continue submitting to my will or she could lock that chastity cage on my cock and take charge back. I realize it was an incredible risk because who knows how sadistic she might have gotten after tasting the other side of the whip. I could have wound up without an orgasm for over a year I imagine.
Every week the choice was the same. She choose to submit.
One day I told her that every week was not working for me. It was simply too short. I preferred every two weeks. She agreed.
That also changed today.
Before I left for work I explained to K that while she had certainly been submissive to my will I still did not have control. Every time she was able to make a decision regarding submitting to me or not was eroding the trust I was building. How could I be the Master and her the slave if she could simply stop things at any point?
This was much different than having a talk about the direction of things, using a safeword, or changing intensity. Her decision was submission or Dominance.
When I came home I asked if she had made her bi-weekly decision. I expected her to tell me to continue for two weeks with a reasoning/explanation as to why she could not give up her grasp on control and trust me.
Today we did away with her bi-weekly decision at her request.
Now the power is mine. I must remain focused and confident for her. She needs my loving yet stern hand to guide her into a better place.
She says she still feels awkward to be called my 'slave' because she is not doing things to please me she is more interested in fixing herself.
Yet with minimal enforcement she has followed my rules even while both of us suffered from the Flu(thankfully on different weeks!)
As I explained to her. I am not doing this for my pleasure. That is a side benefit to me. I am doing this for her benefit.
I know from my own experience when I was the slave that one must be broken down before they can be built back up stronger and better.
This is step 1 of the breaking of Mistress slave K.
Stay tuned for more.

The True Awakening
It has been approximately 18 months since this blog has last seen use.
That is changing. As is the true meaning of 'awakening'.
Oh, first let me start by explaining why this post is not coming from Mistress K.
She has had an awakening to be certain. She now finds herself wearing my collar. Kneeling before me. Doing as I command.
Since we last visited you we had continued our journeys in BDSM and Male Chastity. I even went a full six weeks without an orgasm. It was quite an experience.
We were planning to dive head first back into the lifestyle come January 1st. I finally had a career that allowed me to wear a Chastity device at work with no issues. I had tested it and come January 1st I was going to be chaste for, at minimum 6 months.
You probably find yourself asking what happened. To be quite honest so do I.
All that I can tell everyone is that she currently serves my will. She cums when I allow it. She is teased more every single time, finding her limits and pushing them.
Entering the world of BDSM was a true awakening. It awoke a need inside my wife. Inside my Mistress. Inside my slave.
I don't know for how long she will want to be the slave in the relationship but what I do know is that while she is I will get inside her mind. I will get inside her soul. And I will take charge of every fiber of her being.
Stay tuned. I guarantee it will be exciting.
Particularly when the 180 feet of dyed red rope arrives for some Shibari.

Asserting Control
Dominating my slave is the surest way to lift my mood and reset my entire emotional landscape. I can go from feeling anxious, guilty, and uncertain to feeling confident, positive, and assertive just by looking down into his submissive eyes, cropping him, and stating categorically that I'll be denying him. This is true even if my anxieties had nothing to do with sex or our relationship.
Sometimes I can't imagine not being dominant anymore, even though it started out as a way to indulge my husband. Why, then, do I sometimes resist it?! These episodes are coming less frequently these days, but each time they occur, I question everything from the healthiness of a femdom relationship to my husband's happiness to whether BDSM is really classified as a mental illness.
A few days ago I reasserted my control a bit forcefully.
Before his father got so sick, J had some rules that I was beginning to enforce regularly regarding his personal health habits and his cock. I had relaxed these rules for a bit, but I decided it was time to reintroduce them this week, and I sensed that he was ready as well...but feeling rebellious.
The rules I speak of are these:
1. That he exercise four times per week for half an hour minimum;
2. That he absolutely avoid fast food; and
3. That he not play with my property without my permission, even if it is only to tease himself.
The first two exist for his health and my pleasure. I want my slave not only to look physically fit and appealing, but also to have the stamina to please me at length without tiring or cramping. And I want him around to serve me for many years to come, of course. Before we implemented these rules we discussed his feelings on my use of sex to control his eating and exercise habits. He confirmed that he didn't find it demeaning and could think of no better, more enjoyable way for keeping fit.
The third rule is to ensure that submission is always on his mind. He can't even touch himself without asking my permission. And I often say no.
This weekend I told J that these rules were effective immediately, when he'd thought he had another week or two of relative freedom. He protested. Strongly. He whined. He said, "But I thought I had until next week!" When I responded, "But why wait? I want you to start this week," he did not take this hint. He whined more.
I was displeased.
This was the straw that broke the camel's back, as I had already been irritated with him for persisting in his horny attempts to arouse me when I had flat-out told him I did not intend for us to have sex today, that I wasn't in the mood to be pleasured, and that I wanted to spend some quality time together out of bed.
Finally I brought out the crop. And I cropped him hard. And I explained forcefully, each sentence punctuated by a strike, that these rules are not about what he thinks or he wants. He is the slave. I am the Mistress. I made these rules for his own benefit, and I made these rules because they please me, and that should be his only concern: that they please me. And when Mistress says no to a horny slave, that means no.
If life were logical, I would have felt bad for cropping and scolding him. Instead, I felt much better. I felt back in control. He began to exhibit the proper submissive behavior. I no longer felt guilty about denying him sex. Much (not all, but much) was right with the world.
Acting dominant makes me feel more dominant, just as acting confident or sexy makes one feel so. Now I just have to figure out how to motivate myself to act this way when I am simply not feeling it at all. Slave helps by provoking me to punish him when he sees I'm feeling down, but sometimes this backfires and makes me feel guilty for wanting to punish him instead.
Perhaps as I get more used to this lifestyle, this will happen more naturally.
Your continuously learning Mistress K
