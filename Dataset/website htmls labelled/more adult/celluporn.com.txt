SINISTER 2 (Blu-ray Review) - Universal
USA/2015
Directed By: Ciaran Foy
Written By: Scott Derrickson, C. Robert Cargill
Starring: James Ransone, Shannyn Sossamon
Color/98 Minutes/R
Region A
Release Date: January 12, 2015
The Film
Bughuul is back in this sequel to the 2012 hit film that featured a demon that had a fetish for forcing mass murder on a family while filming it on an 8mm camera. This time he focuses his attention on a pair of boys who have escaped their abusive father with their mother and are haunted by a group of ghost kids who try to fulfill the family's destiny with another one of the 8mm murder reels.
SINISTER 2 takes perhaps the most interesting part of the first film, the murder films, and shoves them down our throats like dicks in a gang bang. It gets to the point where you find yourself counting the number of films for entertainment because there is nothing else worth while on display and of course too much becomes too much too soon but at least they solved the plot hole that these silent films all had original scores in the first film as the films are synced up to a record player which is probably the most thought or effort put into any aspect of the film.
The film is competently made from a directing standpoint and the performances are passable but with a script so dreadful nobody will care. The characters are cookie cutter and make cliche decisions. There's sequences that simply don't add up, such as one of the brothers getting run over with an SUV at a violent speed and shaking it off in seconds but by the point that happens there's so many plot holes that who cares about one more.
SINISTER 2 plays out like the lamest Children Of The Corn sequel you could imagine, complete with children hiding in the corn. It takes the most interesting parts of the first film and turns them into the only moments with any real thought put into them but rendering them worthless at the same time. It is a completely phoned in and thoughtless piece of crap.
Rutabaga rutabaga save me rutabaga!
The Audio & Video
Universal delivers a stunning Blu-ray for the film. The English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 surround mix is brilliant featuring a crystal clear mix across all channels. There's no background noise and no annoyances. The mix pounds through when it wants to and features a delicate mix when it needs to. The 2.40:1 anamorphic widescreen transfer is gorgeous with inky black levels that have no sign of compression issues. Colors are natural with highly detailed surface detail. There's no waxiness to skin tones which appear fleshy and healthy.
The Extras
-Extended Kill Films (Blu-ray exclusive)
-Deleted Scenes
-The Making Of SINISTER 2
-Audio Commentary With Director Ciaran Foy
The Bottom Line
The movie is an absolute waste of time even for fans of the first. If they're trying to make a franchise out of SINISTER than they're going about it the wrong way. Skip this mess.

CONDEMNED (DVD Review) - Image/RLJ Entertainment
USA/2015
Directed By: Eli Morgan Gesner
Written By: Eli Morgan Gesner
Starring: Lydia Hearst, Ronen Rubinstein, Dylan Penn
Color/83 Minutes/Not Rated
Region 1
Release Date: January 5, 2015
The Film
A well off teen girl escapes bickering parents to live with her aspiring musician boyfriend and his roommates in an abandoned Manhattan building filled with other squatters. The mix of chemicals from all of the derelicts calling the building home combine to destroy the minds of the residents and turn them into drooling, puss spewing maniacs.
In the vein of classics like Street Trash and Slime City, CONDEMNED is a seedy splatter horror film set in New York City. The abandoned building with its flickering lighting, dripping pipes, and graffiti covered walls serves as a properly disgusting and scary setting for the film to take place in. There's plenty of colorful characters on display like the rich runaway trust fund girl, the wannabe punk rock stars, the abusive pimp and his woman, the leftover superintendent from the 70s, the meth cooker, the Neo- Nazi and his gay sex slave, and the junkies. This is the all star lineup of fuck ups and that makes every character unlikeable and totally disposable.
There's a big plot hole at the end involving our main protagonist girl and the CDC where they've taken her into custody with the sickness that infected the building and have no idea who she is despite that she'd obviously be on recent missing persons reports. It's forgivable and easily overlooked but it is there. The film stands toe to toe with the messiest splatter cheese fests. Abscesses are popped, disgusting vomit is spewed, blood is sprayed and in various colors.
Acting is a bit over the top for as each character plays a mini caricature of their stereotype and it works for the tone of the film as the whole thing is a bit over the top in violence and excess. I feel there is a bit of an homage to Return Of Living Dead on display with the camera following the various chemicals mixing and dispersing into each apartment similar to how the infected zombie smoke flowed up through the pipes and into the sky forming acid rain in Dan O'Bannon's classic 1985 horror comedy. I appreciate how director Eli Morgan Gesner linked the various residents of the building through their disgusting pipes.
CONDEMNED isn't perfect by any stretch, there's a painfully out of place scene involving a couple of policemen smoking weed that could have been handled much better to keep the point and outcome of that scene the same. It is hamfisted and feels like it was part of another script. The effects on display aren't always the greatest and that all of the characters are unlikable, including our rich girl Tess that the film wants us to cheer for but we have no reason to, takes away our emotional connection to anybody involved in this situation. It's not perfect but the faults are points deducted on a passing grade and not a failure.
The Audio & Video
RLJ/Image deliver CONDEMNED on DVD in a nice looking anamorphic widescreen 1.78:1 transfer with dark and inky black levels and solid detail for a standard dvd. The Dolby Digital 5.1 audio features a nice mix job. The soundtrack and dialogue are complimentary while there's no background noise or audible hiccups.
The Extras
-Cast Interviews
-Script Readings
-42nd Street Mode w/ Live Audience Commentary
-"Entertainment Tonight Canada" on set interview with Dylan Penn
The Bottom Line
CONDEMNED is flawed but fun and deserves an audience. It is a nice way to start off the 2016 horror year and hopefully it gains some attention.

THE GREEN INFERNO (Blu-ray Review) - Universal
Chile, USA/2013
Directed By: Eli Roth
Written By: Guillermo Amoedo, Eli Roth
Starring: Lorenza Izzo, Ariel Levy, Aaron Burns
Color/101 Minutes/R
Region A
Release Date: January 12, 2016
Blu-ray/UVHD
The Film
A group of college students determined to protect the rainforest fly to Peru and crash land in the Amazon jungle where they are captured by a tribe of cannibals and suffer brutal and grotesque acts of savagery while their very existence becomes a fight to survive.
I'm a huge fan of the Italian cannibal films that were released in the 70s and 80s from Umberto Lenzi's Man From Deep River that started it all to the infamous classic Cannibal Holocaust from director Ruggero Deodato. Eli Roth has made it known that's he's a big fan of these films and wanted to make his own film to pay homage to them with THE GREEN INFERNO.
I'm watching this film again to bring you a review and I hope you appreciate it because this movie is pure ass. Where even the lowest form of the Italian cannibal films succeed at only being an exploitation film with graphic imagery and questionable agendas at least they succeeded at being sleazy entertainment. THE GREEN INFERNO isn't entertaining and it is filled with obnoxious unlikeable characters and wooden acting.
Many of the big scare and gross out moments of the film are filled with awful looking CGI that not only takes the viewer out of the moment but can actually have you laughing at the screen when you should be shocked and deplored - one look at the "ant" scene will show you exactly what I mean.
The film is a mess from start to finish with moments of comedy sprinkled throughout that have no place being there. Any message that Roth wanted to convey is completely lost. I doubt there was ever one to begin with.
I'm done talking about THE GREEN INFERNO. I endured it a second time for this review and that will be the last time I waste my time on it.
The Audio & Video
The Blu-ray from Universal features a stunning full HD 1080p transfer in the film's original 2.40:1 aspect ratio. Colors are vibrant and jump off the screen from the lush greens to the blood reds and various color paints used on the native's faces and bodies. Skin tones are fleshy and natural with no signs of waxiness. There's excellent detail level in both surfaces and textures, from the barks of trees to facial hair and threads of cloth. A DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 mix handles the English audio with great success. The mix is brilliant as background noises such as wild birds and animals are noticeable without taking away from the more primary channels of dialogue and score. There's not a single bit of damage or background noise evident in the crystal clear track. You couldn't ask for a nicer A/V presentation of the film.
The Extras
Where Universal killed it with the A/V, they totally dropped the ball on special features including only a audio commentary track and a still gallery. A featurette on shooting in the jungle, the history of cannibal films and where THE GREEN INFERNO fits in, or cast and crew interviews would have been a welcomed addition to really round out the disc.
The Bottom Line
If you're a lover of modern gore movies and don't care about decent writing, acting or watching a good movie in general you may find something to enjoy here. This is shock value for the sake of shock value and doesn't even entertain on the lowest levels.

WRECKER (DVD Review) - XLRator Media
Canada/2015
Directed By: Micheal Bafaro
Written By: Micheal Bafaro
Starring: Anna Hutchison, Andrea Whitburn, Jennifer Koenig
Color/83 Minutes/Not Rated
Region 1
Release Date: January 5, 2016
The Film
Emily and Lesley are on a road trip to party with some friends. The girls quickly become victim of a psychotic tow truck driver who begins playing deadly cat and mouse games with the girls at high speeds and life or death stakes.
I'll be blunt and to the point to save you some time - If you've seen Stephen Spielberg's Duel you've seen this movie done much much better. If you haven't seen Duel go see it. There's nothing here that you won't get with better filmmaking, actual tension and suspense and actors that aren't cliched bimbos.
WRECKER pulls together a full movie that makes sense and that's where the praise really ends. It's seems to be on a counter that every 5 minutes something has to happen but it's never exciting and is telegraphed. Every big moment in the movie is predictable and foreshadowed like the viewers are idiots and can't follow along without our hand being held. The climax is filled with clunky CGI that looks terrible.
The Audio & Video
XLRator Media delivers WRECKER on DVD with a standard release. The 2.35:1 scope aspect ratio is maintained and looks good when the movie looks good. There's times the camerawork in the movie simply doesn't look good and there's nothing the transfer on the DVD could do about that. The 5.1 Dolby Digital has a great mix and is very crisp and clear. Levels are balanced and stable so there's no need to reach for the remote for fluctuating volume.
The Extras
A trailer is the lone extra
The Bottom Line
WRECKER is a movie that has previously been made numerous times and in much better quality. If you're a die hard for these types of highway terror movies you may want to check it out otherwise skip it.

THE LAST HORROR FILM (Blu-ray Review) - Troma
USA/1982
Directed By: David Winters
Written By: Judd Hamilton, David Winters, Tom Klassen
Starring: Joe Spinell, Caroline Munro, Judd Hamilton
Color/87 Minutes/Not Rated
Region FREE
Release Date: December 15, 2015
The Film
Vinny Durand (Joe Spinell) is a cab driver with dreams of being a big time Hollywood director working with his favorite actress Jana Bates (Caroline Munro). Vinny decides the perfect time to make this happen is to follow Jana to the Cannes Film Festival and begins stalking her while her entourage begins turning up dead.
Spinell and Munro team just two short years after they paired up for one of my personal favorites, the classic Maniac and are brilliant here again. Joe Spinell portrays the delusional and increasingly psychotic Vinny Durand with grace, never coming on too strong to the audience or hamming it up. The film could have very easily entered cheesy territory which is not at all the tone that this film was going for but Spinell was a world class talent and brought that to the table to handle Durand's personality quirks.
Former Bond girl Caroline Munro can't be overlooked either and she's as gorgeous as ever as the starlet Durand longs to work with. Munro plays a great damsel in distress type character and is a perfect character to root for and care about - the perfect counterpart to Spinell.
THE LAST HORROR FILM was shot guerrilla style with no permits during the 1981 Cannes Film Festival and that raw, organic energy can be felt seeping through each and every scene. This isn't something filmmakers could easily get away with today and likely will never be duplicated. It's fascinating to watch director David Winters work through the crowds of film fans, critics and stars to form a genuinely disturbing and twisted horror film that packs in some fantastic shots, a good bit of violence and a couple of surprises.
I already have a deep love and appreciation for THE LAST HORROR FILM and what they managed to create while breaking all of the rules and somehow the film still gets better with each viewing. My feelings on the film were echoed by Caroline Munro as she was genuinely excited to chat about it with me at a convention in spring 2015 where she mentioned it was one of her favorite films she's been a part of and is proud of how it turned out. She's a class act and for such an oddly off the wall and twisted exploitation film it can still manage to be defined as classy.
The Audio & Video
Troma dishes out a quality Blu-ray release that does the film justice. The 16x9 anamorphic widescreen transfer has good detail and color reproduction. There's a bit of speckling and light scratches showing that the source material wasn't overly cleaned up but it fits the tone and style of the film to have a bit of grit left over. There's no digital noise or excessive DNR so skin tones still look healthy and natural. The English HD mono audio sounds very good. There is some noticeable background crackling in the audio but it's not distracting and is easily ignored. Otherwise the audio sounds nice and has quality mix and steady levels.
The Extras
-Audio Commentary
-Mr. Robbie short film - the unfinished follow up to Maniac starring Joe Spinell
-New Intro by Lloyd Kaufman
-Highlights of the 2015 Tromadance Film Festival
-A Full Episode of Kabukiman's Cocktail Corner
-The Return Of Dolphin Man
-Trailer
The Bottom Line
I was beyond excited to see that the vastly overlooked movie was getting a Blu-ray release and that it turned out to be a quality presentation. THE LAST HORROR FILM is not only worth your time and money but your collection is suffering without it.
