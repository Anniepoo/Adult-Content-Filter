Update!!!
Boy has it been a long summer. Between trying to write I've
been spending time with my family and we even took a 2 week vacation together.
I'm proud to annouce everyone survived and there were very few fights. Driving
across the country with four kids can be a little nerve wracking but the kids
did great and fighting was at a minimum.
I have a lot going on writing wise. The Nehalem Pack has
several books coming out and or in the works. This series is my
favorite. The characters are easy to write, only because they talk to me quite
a bit more.
Book 26, A Mate Worth Waiting For, has just been accepted by
Siren and will release in November.
This is Raleigh and Christian's book. I had a lot of fun
writing it! Poor Christian has waited four long years to finally be reunited with
his mate. I'd love to tell everyone what happens but what fun would that be? I
will say this, Raleigh is the most understanding, sweet and loveable guy on the
planet.
While plotting out this story and just in general, I listen
to a lot of music. So naturally I made Raleigh a lover of music and serval of
my favorite songs made it into this book. I'll post the playlist. I love when
books mention music and certain songs that help feed into that moment in the
story.
The next book on my to-do list is book 13 in The Warriors of
the Light series. This will be Benedict and Asher’s story. I've been playing
around with a few ideas and because of this type of paranormal storyline I can
step out of the box on what is considered normal. Don’t worry, I’m not going to
do anything to crazy but I'm definitely sending Asher and Benedict on a journey
and maybe resurrecting a fallen warrior. We shall see!
Thanks for stopping by! Happy reading!!!

Release Updates!
I really can’t believe I haven’t posted a blog since
SEPTEMBER! That's like forever ago.
I've been keeping myself busy. Between writing and family there’s
little time for anything else. And now that we're coming upon summer I'm going
to be super busy with all my kids’ stuff. The joys of parenthood. I love them
but they keep my husband and me running around like chickens with our heads cut
off and never going in the same direction.
On to writing news! I have three books coming out within the
next 5 weeks. Here's the list:
Book 20 Nehalem Pack, A Wolf's Atonement April 2
(Paranormal)
This will be Tenny and Jordan’s book. These characters were introduced
in book 19, The Teacher and His Wolf. Tenny is Knox's younger brother who ran
away from home only to end up becoming a prostitute. That right there is why
this title is under the Love Edge category. I will say this I do not
make a lot of references to his past work as a hooker. This story focuses more
on that fact that Tenny abandoned his family not what he did once he was away
from them. There are parts that made my own damn eyes tear up.
Blurb:
Tenny Farrell has made his fair share of mistakes in his
young life. Regret has become a good friend of his and now that he’s in Silver
Creek, he’s willing to do whatever it takes to make amends for his past sins,
but his family isn’t making it easy on him.
The last thing Tenny needs is one more complication to deal
with, but that’s exactly what he gets when he meet Jordan Campbell. The man is
everything Tenny’s ever wanted, but not knowing how Jordan will react to who he
is, Tenny lies. He just needs a little time to figure everything out.
The truth always has a way of coming out and Tenny’s world
comes crashing down around him when all the half-truths he’s told are exposed.
Nothing is ever as it seems, and Tenny is discovering some things in life are
worth fighting for. He just has to pray it’s enough to grant him forgiveness.
Book 12 The Warriors of the Light, Julian's Forever April 18
(Paranormal)
This is Julian's and Daniel’s book. Julian is Damon’s half-brother
and was introduced in book 11, Damon's Determined Wolf. Daniel is a human who
is searching for the person responsible for murdering his best friend. Daniel
is going through some of his own personal issues but I don’t want to give too
much away!
Blurb:
Daniel Young is battling terminal cancer and using what time
he has left to find answers to who killed his best friend no matter what danger
it puts him in. With nothing left to live for what does Daniel have to lose?
Julian Salva joined the Warriors of the Light to help put a
stop to the evil trying to take over the world and to find his nephew. Never in
a million years did he expect to meet a fearless human on his latest mission.
The man infuriates Julian with his lack of caution and inability to follow an
order. For reasons unknown to Julian he’s falling for the human, if only Daniel
was his mate.
Nothing is ever as it seems but there’s no time to find out
all the answers. With Daniel’s life hanging in the balance Julian will risk
everything for a man he barely knows.
Julian prays that this time, time is on his side.
Book 2 A Forever Home, Safe in HIs Arms May 2 (Contemporary)
This series gets neglected a lot but I really love the
characters within this series and I also have a lot of plans for this series.
Safe in His Arms is E and Sam's story. A lot of tension and frustration is in
this story. Which I did on purpose. What’s a good love story without a little
struggle and give and take??
Blurb:
A chance encounter six months ago has changed Elliot Nolan’s
life forever. It was only supposed to be one night of great sex, nothing more
but once Officer Sam Lancaster steps back into his life, Elliott doesn’t know
what to do. He’s suffered abuse from a man who claimed to love him before and
allowing someone so close again is a fear Elliot’s not sure he can ever
overcome.
All Sam wants to do is fall in love and settle down. Is that
so much to ask for? Apparently when it comes to Elliot it is. Sam tries to be
just friends with Elliot but that is proving to be a lot easier said than done.
People come in and out of your life for a reason and Elliot
is starting to see that maybe Sam’s worth the risk. A lifetime alone is a safe
option but living without Sam is something Elliot isn’t sure he can do.
I just finished Nehalem Pack 21. I'm still working on a
title for that one! I will admit I did something a little different in this
story and I hope the readers will enjoy it.
Hope everyone has an excellent week and happy reading!!!

Today's Guest: Jamie Lake
Today I am lucky to have Gay Romance Author Jamie Lake as my
guest. He's discussing his Bad Boy series so please sit back, relax and enjoy Jamie
Lake!
For those who aren’t
familiar with the Bad Boy series, tell us about it.
It’s the story of a
really hot teacher who becomes desperate for money when his hours are cut and the only choice he has is to
moonlight as an erotic masseuse for
men. The problem is, he has to keep is profession a secret from the school and it’s right when he meets the guy of his
dreams, who happens to be not only one of his student’s dads but also a cop.
If you could be any
of your characters in Bad Boy for a day, who would you choose and why?
I’d
say Chip cause he’s so hot. I’d touch myself all day. Haha. And also cause he’s a parent and I’d love to be a
dad one day soon. I think I’d love a
daughter but I’m open to whatever God blesses me with.
How long did it take
you to write Bad Boy?
The first Bad Boy book, I think might have taken me a
few weeks. I can write a book in a week or less but by the time it goes through
editing and copy editing, it can take a few weeks, sometimes longer.
How do you plan your
writing day?
Well, I get up first thing in the morning and after taking a
leak and walking the dogs and procrastinating, I’ll try to write in 20 minute sessions.
I usually, that early in the morning, manage to do a couple of sessions before
I take my morning nap and then I wake up and try write at least until 3pm with
those 20 minute sessions. If I have any drive left after that, I try to write
more. I go to bed between 7:30pm-10pm every night but I always get up at 4am
either way. Sometimes I’ll watch a TV show on Amazon Prime before I go to bed.
Writing so many
different series from The Trainer, Boyfriend for Rent, Marked for Love, Stay
Always and Bad Boy, do you ever get the characters mixed up?
No, because I
focus on just one book series at a time. I
could juggle two probably, like write one in the morning and the other in
the afternoon, but I prefer not.
What m/m books other
than your own do you recommend people to read?
I’m a big fan of what Kindle
Alexander and River James are doing. And
I love Sara York. They’re all awesome people.
What are some of the
biggest misconceptions that you think people who don’t read m/m have about the
genre?
Many people assume the books are
all about sex and that seems to be the consensus of what a lot of people think about gay relationships. They
are so focused on the sex part, they don’t
stop to think about the relationship. Many of my straight male friends talk about the exact same relationship
problems with their girlfriends that I’ve
experienced with my boyfriends.
Where can we get a copy of Bad Boy? You can get it exclusively
on Amazon http://bit.ly/BADBOYNOVEL1  or email me at JamieLakeNovels AT gmail.
Blurb
Peter never thought things would get so tough that he’d need
to give out sensual massages in secret in order to make ends meet. He’s a kindergarten
teacher and a good one who loves his job. But being a sensual masseuse by
night, hot as it may be, is not exactly his dream. All he wants is a nice quiet
life and the love of a great guy, a family, and someone who will love him from
the heart and accept him without judgment. But when the school slashes his
hours in half and no other jobs are available, the opportunity to give sensual
massages to men under a secret name seems like the best way out of his current
situation at least for now.
Chip is a tough, macho, blue collar, police detective whose ex
has just died. He is also a dedicated loving single father to a 5-year-old son.
In a town like Las Vegas, he thinks he’ll never meet anyone who is ready to
start a family. He has had his fair share of flakes and liars in his life but
when he finally met his son’s favorite kindergarten teacher, probably the hottest
guy he’d seen in years, his hope is lifted. He just knows, this is the one. Has
he finally met someone who is honest and won’t hide things from him?
For Peter, what he thinks will be a onetime thing turns into
a booming business giving sensual massages at night. Meeting Chip seems like the
welcome change he needs in his life. He is by far, everything he could ever ask
for in a man but it’s not exactly the best time in his life to meet someone.
But if Peter doesn’t jump at the chance to be with Chip, could he be missing
out on the one he’s been waiting for?
Peter promises himself he’ll only do the sensual massages in
secret just until he gets caught up on his bills. Then, he’ll quit. But what will
the school where he works say if they find out what Peter is doing on the side
and what is worse, what will Detective Chip say when he finds out his dream guy
has been a very bad boy?
What will Chip say if he finds out what Peter is doing on the
side? And, what’s worse, what will the school say when they find out this teacher
has been a very bad boy?

Logan Blitz Tour
Tour long Giveaway: $50 Gift Card
Dates: 8/26/14 thru 8/28/2014
Blurb:
A man who always sees beneath the surface.
Logan has lived his dream of being an artist for hundreds of years. He’s painted some of the most beautiful women in the world, but none of them compare to Meghan Campbell. When they are paired up to go after the next jewel, resisting her becomes almost impossible, but he knows he must. The witch is hiding something and until he knows what that is, he cannot fully trust her.
A woman who can lure any man.
As a witch with siren abilities, Meg has never had a problem with the opposite sex. That is, until she met Logan. The irritating man seems to be the one person in the world who doesn’t succumb to her spell. Unfortunately, he is the one man she really wants. No matter how hard she tries, he resists her.
As they embark on their quest for the next jewel, tempers flare and passion ignites. But when a new layer of the curse is revealed, they discover their failure could put lives in danger. The two must work together to fight the rising power against them and hope that those who support the Clan survive the fight.
Excerpt
She heard the sound of feet
down the hall and knew her morning solitude was about to be broken. When Jack
slid into the room laughing, she smiled in reaction until she saw his
companion.
Logan.
The man brought about too many
feelings to count. Dealing with him on half a cup of coffee was just not fair.
And of course, he looked amazing. All that messy hair, his bedroom eyes, and
the stubble he hadn’t shaved…how was a woman supposed to ignore all that
beauty?
“Morning, Miss Meghan. How are
you this morning?” Jack asked, drawing her attention away from Logan.
“I’m very fine indeed, Sir Jack.”
He giggled like he always did.
“I am not a sir.”
She widened her eyes. “But you
are the son of Angus, are you not?”
His smile grew. “I am.”
She looked up at Logan. “Good
morning.”
“That’s your opinion,” he
mumbled as he headed for the coffee. It was out of character for the artist.
He’d always seemed to be in a good mood until the last few days.
“Did you wake Logan?” she asked
Jack.
“Yes, but I needed to wake him.
I had a dream,” he said sounding more like the solemn boy Maggie had told her
about.
“Oh, don’t you know not to let
dreams bother you.”
“Some of Jack’s dreams are
premonitions,” Logan said as he placed his coffee at the head of the table.
Where she liked to sit. Bugger.
“I understand. But, if they are
premonitions, there is nothing we can do about it now.” Meg knew that better
than anyone and had paid a steep price. She returned her attention to Jack.
“So, Sir Jack, what would you like for breakfast?”
“I can get my own,” he
announced.
Logan, for his part, had
prowled over to the sideboard to get himself some food. As she had thought
before, he hadn’t been what she would have pegged as a stereotypical artist. He
had the look. But, his temperament had been one of well, a normal, every day
person. Artists, and she had dealt with more than one in her day, tended to be
moody and well, more trouble than they were worth.  Meg didn’t like moody men. She liked them to
be happy and somewhat needy because that’s how she had earned her living for so
long.
Still, it was hard to ignore
the way he moved, or those long, artist’s fingers as. She could just imagine
what he could do with those. Lord, to feel them dance over her flesh—
Jack made a sound and he was
looking at her strangely. Oh, bugger. The boy could definitely read thoughts
from time to time.
“What else is on your mind this
morning, Jack?” she asked as she sipped on her coffee.
He shrugged as he sat down to
the table and started to eat his bacon. He chewed for a few seconds, then said,
“Did you know that Logan sleeps without any clothes on?”
She choked, spewing a bit of
her coffee. “Does he indeed?”
“Spilling all my secrets,
Jack?” Logan asked.
“I didn’t know it was a secret.
You have to tell me. Besides, Miss Meghan was thinking about--”
“Never mind about that, Jack.
Get to eating,” she ordered, hoping Logan didn’t notice her blush.

Bio:
From an early age, USA Today Bestselling Author Melissa loved to read. First, it was the books her mother read to her including her two favorites, Winnie the Pooh and the Beatrix Potter books. She cut her preteen teeth on Trixie Belden and read and reviewed To Kill a Mockingbird in middle school. It wasn’t until she was in college that she tried to write her first stories, which were full of angst and pain, and really not that fun to read or write. After trying several different genres, she found romance in a Linda Howard book.
Since the publication of her first book in 2004, Melissa has had close to fifty romances published. She writes in genres from historical suspense to modern day erotic romance to futuristics and paranormals. Included in those releases is the bestselling Harmless series. In 2011, Melissa branched out into self-publishing with A Little Harmless Submission and the popular military spinoff, Infatuation: A Little Harmless Military Romance. Along the way she has garnered an epic nomination, a multitude of reviewer’s recommended reads, over five Capa nods from TRS, three nominations for AAD Bookies and regularly tops the best seller lists on Amazon and Barnes & Noble.
Since she spent her childhood as a military brat, Melissa swore never to marry military. But, as we all know, Fate has her way with mortals. She is married to now retired AF major and is raising her own brats, both human and canine. She spends her days giving in to her addiction to Twitter and spends her days thankful for their new home and the short trip to Wegmans.
