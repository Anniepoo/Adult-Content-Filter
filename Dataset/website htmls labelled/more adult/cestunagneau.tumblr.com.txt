Femme Fatale || Sebtanainthedarkness-santana:
Running her finger around the rim of her glass, Santana’s eyes stayed fixed on Seb as he spoke, “You should be impressed with the work of art you do leave with. She’s sitting right here.” She teased with a sparkle in her eye and laughter in her tone, “Some of my pieces are on display around the manor but most of them are sold once completed.”
The female watched as the other pulled his seat around next to her and couldn’t help but laugh, leaning over to whisper in his ear, “Not a witch.. But that would explain a lot if it were true.” Sitting back a little, San gently parted her legs just enough to let Seb’s hand slide along her inner thigh, “I can’t help that you can’t resist me, in fact, I rather enjoy it,”
“Maybe next time you can actually give me a real tour of your house.” He said with the same mischievous glint in his eyes. “It will be such a shame if I only enjoy my work of art in the bedroom and the kitchen.” He hummed as she parted her leg and clicked his tongue in mock disapproval at her last words. “Vanity thy name is Santana.” He preached with a quick peck on her cheek and delicate circles on her thigh. Her hemline was riding up and he was glad for the privacy of the table cloth.
Their appetizers arrived shortly. The waitress was a bit surprised by Sebastian’s change of position but she quickly adapted. It was a bit difficult to eat with his left hand but he was not willing to remove his hand from his date’s leg. “So you said your house is a family property. So I’d take it you grew up here in New Orleans?”

Femme Fatale || Sebtanainthedarkness-santana:
Santana half watched the movie, concentrating instead on her fingers stroking along Sebastian’s inner thigh, just enough to get him excited and starting to stray from the movie before she moved away, shifting slightly in her seat to drape her legs over his lap and sipping at her drink before repeating her actions several more times throughout the duration of the movie.
Once the movie was over, Santana quickly slid her shoes back on and let the male act like a true gentleman,; leading her to the car, opening and closing her door for her and then holding out her chair once they reached the restaurant, she couldn’t help but think that she could get used to this; It had been far too long since she’d had the chance to even meet a man with manners like Sebastian’s. The raven haired beauty lowered her menu once the waiter had left them, “I didn’t..” She agreed with a nod, “I’m a lady of leisure if you need a term for it. No school, no job, or at least not one that really pays. I paint sometimes, I’ve had a talent for it since I was nineteen and ever since then I paint and occasionally men and women come sniffing around wanting to get their hands on me but instead they leave with artwork.” The Latina shrugged, a smirk tugging at her lips, “I make a fair amount of money from it.”
Sebastian took a sip from his water and lifted an eyebrow. So she was an artist. “I love art. But I’m more in the film side of things than oils and acrylic. Must be nice to do what you want and earned too.” He said. “Should I be complimented because I did not leave with an artwork?” He smirked, leaning slightly to push back stray pieces of hair behind her ear. He looked at her for a second before deciding to fuck it and scooted his chair so he was sitting beside her rather than across her.
“You’re just irritatingly magnetic, do you know that?” He huffed with a little pout. He remembered how she teased him in the movie theater and took revenge by caressing her leg under the table. He grinned and kissed her cheek. “You’re a witch, aren’t you?” He teased. “And this is some sort of weird voodoo.”

Femme Fatale || Sebtanainthedarkness-santana:
Santana made sure that she was comfortable, picking at the tub of popcorn between them and half smirked, “Kinky..” She teased, nodding as she listened to the male as he told her about himself, “Oh, you’re a student? I’d never have guessed that.” she laughed lightly, “the whole Spring Break thing gave that away but it’s not a bad thing. As least you’ve got a brain, more than I can say for most of the men that I meet.” The vampires shrugged, turning her attention to the movie, a smile playing at her lips when Seb kissed her temple, “It’s a pleasure to meet you properly, Mr Smythe.. Pleasure being the operative word when it comes to the two of us.”
He hummed in agreement, his chest vibrating from the air. “Pleasure indeed, Ms. Lopez.” He spent most of the movie watching the screen and playing with Santana’s hair. Occasionally, he kissed her face. She really was irresistible to him. He was not sure if she was paying any attention to the movie but she was not complaining and that was great to him.
The temperature was a bit lower when they got out of the theater and he tucked Santana against his body as they made their way to his car. They arrived in Bistro Daisy in no time. The quaint little yellow cottage is lit by numerous line of fairy lights. They were seated and he pulled out a chair for his date and slid in his seat across her. Once they had ordered their food he looked at her. “You never told what you do for a living.” He said. “Are you a student too?"

The latina carefully made her way up the stairs to the back of the cinema room, settling herself in the seat and pulling up the arm between the two of them to get more comfortable, even toeing off her shoes, “That’s a fair proposal.” She nodded, eating another piece of popcorn before turning to look at the male, “My full name is Santana Maria Lopez and I’m only willing to say that I’m early twenties. It’s a woman’s prerogative to keep her age to herself, but I’m not fifty, that’s what’s important.” She smiled softly.
Sebastian smiled when she settled comfortably against him like a human pillow. He chuckled at her answer. “I doubt if anybody would believe that you’re fifty, darling.” He pinched the tip of her nose. “But if you were, I always wanted to date a much older woman.” The previews were a constant background sound behind them. “My turn, I’m Sebastian Smythe, I’m also in my early twenties and as you may have guessed I’m a college student in dear old UNO."
His attention was diverted momentarily when the movie started. He had seen this before and he always believed that if one would like to really watch a movie they should do it by themselves. He curled an arm across Santana’s shoulders and pressed his lips against her temple.

The female returned Sebastian’s kiss with a smile, taking his arm as it was offered and stepping through the threshold with him, effortlessly walking in her five inch heels alongside him, “Too bad that I like it this way.. Play your cards right and I might keep them one day, if you’re lucky.” She smiled teasingly, slipping down into the passenger seat and crossing her ankles as she buckled in feeling the male’s eyes on her, “Who needs a social life when you’ve got a sex life like yours?” She purred, raking her eyes over him as she spoke, “I used to have a night life, now it’s spent with both of us throwing the other around in bed and I can’t say that I’m complaining.”
Santana rolled her eyes a little, “Of course, I have a penchant for nerds, somehow you manage to hide it.. That looks like it’s working out for you.” She let him pay, leaning closer to his side as he did so and picking up the tub of popcorn to eat a little of it, thankful for something so sweet that she could actually taste it for once, “I don’t see me running, especially not in these heels. How do you know that I won’t be interested in this movie? There’s a lot you still don’t know about me.”
“I’m hoping to change that fact.” He replied. If there was something different from Santana, it was that he actually wanted to know more about her. They had not had a lot of chance to talk but the snippets of conversations they had were interesting enough. They entered their cinema  "How about we start with the basics?“ He led her to a seat at the back of the theater, "Like your full name and age.”

Santana took her time getting ready, blow drying her hair straight before blowing it into tumbling sleek waves around her shoulders. She made sure that her make up was flawless, emphasising her eyes with smokey make up, complete with lots of dark eye liner. Once she was happy with her face, she crossed over to her closet and threw it open, searching through all of her clothes until she found the dress she wanted.
An hour later, Santana descended the stairs to answer the door herself, having entrusted the boys to dispose of the body from earlier out the backdoor while she left via the front. She pulled the door open to reveal that she had poured herself into a strapless red bandage dress, paired with Louboutin pumps and a box clutch, “We meet again, handsome.” She smirked when she saw the male on the door step.
Sebastian licked his lips once he laid eyes on Santana. She looked like a vision in red. He stepped up into her space, kissing her quickly on the lips and offering his arm. “You look stunning.” He praised, sincerely. He ran a hand through her hair and smiled. “Too bad… I liked your curls just a bit better.” He opened his car’s door for her before sliding into the driver’s seat. He gave her a once over after he had buckled up. “You’re bad for my social life.” He said with a smirk. “I want to stay in but I need to show you off.” He started the engine and drove to the movie theater first. “I hope you like superhero movies.” He said.
They were a striking couple, Santana and him. He saw that as they approached the double glass doors of the theater. She fitted quite nicely against his side when he rested an arm across the small of her back. He bought two tickets for the new Captain America movie and a big tub of popcorn. “I’m a bit of a nerd I’m afraid.” He revealed with a smile. “You can go running to the hills now. I wouldn’t blame you.”

Pulling the towel from her head and running her fingers through her curls gently as she listened to Sebastian, smirking to herself, “I have no issues with that, I’d keep you forever if you wanted me to. You’re a great addition to my bedroom.” She chuckled.
Spreading her thighs a little as the male knelt between her legs, shuddering softly as she felt his hands running over her bare skin, “I was just thinking red as it so happens..” She murmured, leaning to return his passionate kiss, “I’ll see you in a few hours.. Try not to miss me too much..” she teased him, “Go, before I drag you back to bed.”
“Oh please, we both know you’re the one who can’t get enough of me.” He teased back with a wink. He pulled back and gave a little wave before exiting the room. He almost jumped in surprised when Daniel the Gorilla appeared out of nowhere to lead the way out. He smirked and gave the man a mock punch on the arm. “Don’t wait up later tonight. I’m bringing Santana home.” He said. Daniel did not look very happy about that. He waved again and slid into his car.
His bachelor’s pad seemed puny when compared to Santana’s mansion but he loved it. The building was a old brownstone with ivy clinging to the bricks and his one bedroom and bath unit had a nice view of the park across the street. Once he changed into clean clothes he grabbed his phone and cashed in that favor from one of his friends who co-owned a trendy restaurant in town. Networking had its perks. He scored a table for two. It would be a fun night.
He passed time finishing up some revision for his thesis then took another shower and his much needed shave. He picked his clothes. Something comfortable and fancy enough looking. He got into his car and pressed Santana’s door bell at exactly 8 in the evening.

San laughed softly, watching in appreciation as the male not only rinsed her clean but then cleaned himself off in record time. Just as she moved to pick up a towel to dry off after stepping out of the shower, she smirked as Sebastian did it for her, “You know, a girl can get used to things like this. I might have to keep you around if you keep spoiling me like this.”
Wrapping her hair in the towel as she sat on the end of her rumpled bed, the latina, nodding slightly to herself as he drank a good portion of the formula laced coffee, “You look a lot perkier than you were before, good to see that my coffee making skills aren’t that bad. even thought they do suck.” She leant back on her hands, biting the edge of her lip, “I’m free almost all nights… I’m more of a night owl anyway. Pick my up afteer sundown? We can hit the town and you can treat me like a lady if you wanna. I think I might have something for you to wear for on your way home.” She gestured to Seb’s crumpled clothes, “Those only serve as evidence to all your friends that you’re getting thoroughly fucked.. When it’s said like that I think you’ll probably want to keep them, show off a little like all men do.”
He shrugged. His grandmother had taught him manner. He was sure this was not how she pictured he would be using them but what she did not know would not hurt her… or him. “If last night is a norm, I’d want to stay forever.” He said, half seriously. He crinkled his nose as he put on his clothes. He was a bit of a neat freak and he hated wearing unwashed clothes.
He smiled when he was all dressed and stepped up to Santana. He knelt between her legs, running his hands up and down her skin. “So I’ll see you later tonight.” He placed a kiss on the sensitive skin of her inner thigh. “Wear something nice and red.” He leaned up and pressed his lips against hers in a deep kiss.

Femme Fatale || Sebtanainthedarkness-santana:
Untying her robe and letting it fall to the floor, Santana stepped into the shower with the male, allowing him to draw her into a lazy kiss, it was stark contrast to those that they had been sharing just hours before but she couldn’t say that she didn’t like these too. Joining Sebastian under the spray, the female’s dark hair quickly saturated and when she ran her hand through it to push it over her shoulder, giving the male more skin to lather up, it started to spring back into its natural tight curls, “You took the words right out of my mouth..” She half moaned, letting her body relax under his skilled hands. So much so that when he pulled her flush against him again, she gasped in shock, hand instantly moving to his hip to keep steady. Once she realised that she was, in fact, steady, she used the grip on him as leverage to grind her ass back against him, “I’d say are you up for a quickie but I brought you coffee.. It’s not great but after last night I think we could both use it.”
Coffee in the afternoon sounded weird but his jaw cracked open in a yawn and the notion sounded wonderful now. With some difficulty, he pulled away from her. They rinsed and he wiped her down with a towel before doing it to himself and wrapping it around his waist. A glance at the mirror showed him that her needed a shave.
He poured himself a cup of coffee. It tasted odd but he never did like coffee from American but the effects were almost immediate every sip he took. His headache was gone and he felt stronger when he finished his portion. “Now where was this when I was in the middle of my exams?” He asked Santana in an amused tone. He placed the cup done and looked at his rumpled clothes . “I think to go home and change.” He said. He rubbed his cheek. “Shave too. Are you free tonight? How about I take you out to the movies and dinner?"

Brewing a large pot of coffee and pouring in a healthy dose of the replenishing formula, Santana stood by the kitchen door to watch the guys carry the already ripe smelling body back downstairs. The latina screwed up her nose, cursing her vampire senses; Any normal person wouldn’t be able to smell the death that was creeping under the door to the basement. Satisfied that the body was out of sight, she picked up the coffee pot and two mugs, walking over to the basement door, “I want the two of you to remain in coffin for the day, I have Daniel to lurk for me. You’re both in my bad books, I hear a complaint and I’ll stake you myself.”
San turned, slamming the door closed behind her and started up the grand staircase, the sound of running water reaching her ears as she neared the top step. Striding along the hallway, the vampiress let herself back into her bedroom, depositing the coffee pot and mugs on the table before slipping into the bathroom and leaning against the door with a feral hunger in her eyes that she tried to mask, “I see that you found your way to my ensuite..” She purred.
“Hey…” He greeted with a little lift of his head. “Good sense of direction, remember?” He slicked back his wet hair and smiled. “Are you  just going to stand there?” He asked. Once she joined him he drew her close, kissing her languidly. His body was too exhausted to do anything else it seemed. He helped her under the warm spray of water. She had wonderful hair. He liked blondes but Santana could be the exception to that rule. He reached for the body wash and started sudding her up. He might spend most of last night exploring her body but that did not take any pleasure away from doing this. “This is nice.” He murmured as he pulled her against him. Her back to his front. His not so flaccid cock nestled nicely between her ass. .
