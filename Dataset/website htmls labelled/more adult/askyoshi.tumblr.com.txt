“Well, folks… It’s the midnight of Sunday night, and Boots & Saddles Weekend is coming to an official close. Our final event, of course, is the midnight swim, which…well, is skinny dipping of course. Everyone please join us in removing your boots, saddles, and whatever event-approved accessories you wore with them and and taking a refreshing swim in the Yoshi Island sea. Remember: you are responsible for your own clothes.While the event is officially over once your swim is, you’re welcome to stay as long as you like, dressed or undressed however suits your fancy. Well…at least until Monday morning, ‘cause we kinda have to clean up everything then…”

“Um… I can walk, y’know…” said the younger Ice Bro on the Fire Bro’s back.“Hey, I’m just getting into the spirit of the event!” laughed the big brother. “I’ll let you off once we’re actually in the festival area, cool?”“Sure, I guess…” shrugged Winnie. “Sorry about mixing up yesterday’s boat schedule…”Char waved it off. “Ah, honest mistake.”

I used to do Boots and Saddles Weekend on AskYoshi! But I’m not active there anymore. petalburgyoshi wanted to carry on the tradition and dang he drew something for it on a million accounts of his I didn’t even know existed. It’s pretty late but not over yet - so here’re Oxnard and Yoshi joining in on the stylish fun!

“Oh, dear. It’s already past 8? It’s almost baby girl’s bedtime! Well, I suppose it’s now or never. Ladies and gentlemen, we all know that saddles are a tremendous piece of yoshi culture. They are universally worn to protect our backs and allow us to carry objects, young ones, or…in some cases…famous human plumbers… Teehee.But do you why us yoshis started wearing saddles in the first place? The history of the yoshi saddle is, believe it or not, actually tied closely with that of the koopa shell. As some know and others don’t, yoshis and the common variety of koopas are closely related in the evolutionary chain. Many generations ago, the two species looked a lot more alike than they currently do, and our kind wore shells very similar to the ones worn by the koopas of the time.As generations went by, the two species grew apart both socially and genetically. Due to the changes in anatomy and posture, yoshis stopped building a front to their shells, and they evolved simply into armored back plates. However, yoshi communities had developed into such close and tight-knit communities by then that they’d begun feeling more security from togetherness that individual personal protection.The ‘half-shells’ continued on for the sake of tradition, but they were made of softer materials–mainly dried and preserved fruit skins. They gained a smoother design, deviating from the shell’s hexagonal pattern. Eventually, they couldn’t even be called shells anymore, as they were designed more for riding comfort than protection, and more wearers had simply begun calling them saddles instead.Naturally, the current koopa form is still more suited to wear shells than our saddles. But it’s still a touching gesture when a koopa tries the look anyway out of genuine interest in our culture. It shows that Boots and Saddles Weekends like this one are doing their social job and, in the process, helping bridge that gap that’s grown between our kinds over the many years…”

“Umm… Am I late? I’ve been hearing this Boots and Saddles festival is quite the social event so, er…I just thought I’d give it a try just for the experience. …It’s really drafty.”((OK, now that toads have been canonically declared a sexless race (presumably meaning gender identities for them are just identities), I have no idea how to draw my toadsona’s naked crotch anymore. So for now, I’m just giving him “troll doll anatomy”.))
