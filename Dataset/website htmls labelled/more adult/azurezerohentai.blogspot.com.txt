Majo - released (RPG)
Majo is a simple RPG Maker ace game about a witch named Izuki that gets kicked out of her home by the Demon King whom lusts after her body. Now she must take down his dungeons to build her strength and gain new abilities (hookshot and a bow), solve puzzles, get to tie up enemies (or be tied up by them) and generally have fun before going back to kick his ass.
it's a fun and comedic story that ought to take 90 minutes to complete but there's a nice amount of content including unique game over scenes for most enemies (some of the are grouped into one scene)
be sure to try the demo :)
content
8 sexy enemies
9 game over scenes
13cg +variants
4 dungeons to puzzle and fight through
features
sexual attacks - kiss, grope, and whip your way to victory
sexual status effects- horny and tied up, tied up gives you a sexy image of some enemies (and laughable ones for some others)
on map abilities - hookshot and the bow for fun puzzles.
You can purchase the game at dlsite (which is censored and more expensive)
or buy the unlock file for 7usd/£4.6 (roughly) by following the link below
to stay out of the reach of a new annoying VAT law in the EU, I have to manually email all unlock files to customers, so sometimes you might have to wait a few hours to receive it.
once you have the unlock file, all you need to do is put it in the same folder as the game.exe in the demo

update
5/02/2015
Work on Majo is progressing smoothly, chances are game will be done in the next 3 weeks...
yesterday i got the base for dungeon 4 made along with this pretty girl. [picture removed]
currently she's called coco but i'm open to ideas.
Also, I have a patreon now, people wanting to support me can go there...though i don't want people to feel short changed, so it should only be for people who want to support me making games and have spare money...
I keep getting down , because I don't seem to get many responses to the threads i post about my games... the only time i got any real replies were when i held competitions for free copies and the like...but those werent really good for sales.
I have a deadline looming, in august my student overdraft starts charging interest, so i need to make £1950 before then or I'll be stuck with an endless debt, my mother is kind enough to not kick me out though i haven't paid any rent since before xmas. So any donations/commissions are greatly appreciated.
Damsel quest remains my best selling game(272 copies), with science girl trailing behind by 50 copies. Grimoire hasn't hit 100 sales yet, so i'm dissappointed in that too, i thought it was a fun game...
if all this comes off as whiny that's fine, i understand most of the fault lies with me as an artist and a spriter, and maybe as a games designer too, but I'd like to hear from people even if they don't like me very much...

Grimoire (Rika) nearing completion
I'd have liked this game to be a metroidvania, but this game is more like kurovadis and it's linearity.
A simple story, Rika the witch is trying to obtain a dangerous magical tome. but when she arrives at the dungeon it's located in, she finds another witch got there first, whom dumps her into the depths of the castle. Rika is a dropout so she only has one basic projectile spell to being with, and must fight her way through the depths to obtain more spells and find a way back up to defeat the other witch.
this is the final demo content wise, but the unlock file has not been generated yet so people will need to redownload it when i release some time before the 20th.
controls are arrow keys to move, X to jump, and C to use spells.
the other day i spent 3 hours going through every room in the game and tiling it.
the list of stuff i have left to make is as follows
final boss room - including the remaining attacks for the boss and game over animation
3 game over cg
crush the bug that leads to the wrong game over cg.

Dropbox still down
the ban seems to have been extended beyond what it should so i've mirrored most of my demos on mega
https://mega.co.nz/#F!30xGEDxR!HqPOxu9OLqUO07dHEZ63lQ
i have also redirected my checkouts to mega, so now i dont have to email everyone who buys one of my games (though a few dont get through every now and then)
expo was great. didn't buy much though, couple of no game no life wallscrolls, a momo deviluke figure, some lovely wolf ears, and sora's tee-shirt from ngnl
also, my girlfriend proposed to me with a ring in a tardis...that was a shock, so yeah, im a finacee now

the game contains some pretty difficult puzzles, one in particular has a bit of a meta solution involving data shared across all save files.

update 27/11/2013
I'm actually quite shocked, science girl has sold over 100 copies in the
first week, which is getting me really anxious to work on a proper game
again...
both the next damsel quest game and my non adult game idea have similar
mechanics so i could probably design them both alongside each other,
however... my spriter is taking a break after science girl wore him out
so i'm left with nothing to do...
one person on ULMF is considering commissioning that rpgmaker game i've
been doing little bits and pieces of but i can't afford to commit to it
unless i get the deposit at least (since i need to pay an artist for the
cgs) this is cause english rpg maker games typically haven't been
successful sales wise... (couldnt help working on it a little though)
but because of the funding i would be releasing it at a cheaper price
than i would be able to risk usually as the commission would provide me
8/52 weeks rent
the next damsel quest game is gonna be an action rpg/platformer, the
upgrade system will allow the player to raise whichever stats they want
using skill points upon leveling, but there will also be extra skills
you can unlock by offering item drops at altars, like lifesteal (i do
love that lifesteal) i dropped the parry system because it simplifies development and complexity doesnt always mean good gameplay
the non adult game will use the same engine as the dq game, but the
upgrade system will be different, with an equip system instead, the
different runes you can equip modify your stats and some offer abilities
like taking less poison damage, this difference means i can keep the
general gameplay the same but the challenge will be different, for
example. the anti poison rune lowers your stats, but allows you enough
time to get through a poison filled passageway, but the lowered stats
means you have to be extra careful to avoid enemy strikes
and the rpgmaker game is similar in gameplay to ib or witch house, you
find items, solve puzzles and make choices, but also you have to sneak
through certain enemy filled areas, you can see a barebones example of
the necessary scripts at work here
this game has also given me the opportunity to give emi her own game
(she would have been the main love interest in that yuri game i gave up
on a while back)

To put things in perspective (moneys report)
this tax year, i have currently  made £129.69 per month, my rent per week is £75...so, i'm still not there as success stories go...
so I'd like to hear more of what you guys and girls (shouldn't have been surprised about) want in your games :)  mechanics wise too, my research indicates that rpg mechanics such as leveling and choice in character progression adds a lot of replay value to a game, which is something i would prefer to making the player grind to unlock gallery stuff (great vita escape).
currently only got my object0 sprites to play with but there arent enough of them to make a full game, so im currently just building platformer mechanics for use in candy quest and damsel quest 3,
also someone might be commissioning an rpgmaker game from me, which i'm really looking forward too as many people seemed to have enjoyed princess escape and it's a similar format to that, and the funding means i can afford the risk of making it, you can also expect the game to be released cheaper as a result, but i cant start work properly until i get the deposit so i can pay the artist i want to work with for the cgs (because my own aren't really that good or consistent)
damsel quest
274 sales meaning roughly £822
science girl
49 sales roughly £79.87
7/12 months into the tax year

OKAY, science girl is finally complete after weeks of boredom waiting for sprites to be finished XD

mega mirror

you can buy it at my tumblr
full version includes;
9 enemies
3 levels

my stance on piracy of my games
it's gonna happen and i don't mind that to some extent, but please keep it out of my face and don't do it in my threads... it really hurts to have something i worked hard on trampled by people and saying what is effectively "I want to play your game but don't want to pay a few dollars for it"
i know some people honestly can't afford it, or don't want it appearing on their records...but there's a perfectly good donate button for the latter, and only one person has used it.
edit- TWO PEOPLE now... though this does seem to be a kindness donation as they allready bought both games on sale atm
edit2- NOPE...same guy :)
