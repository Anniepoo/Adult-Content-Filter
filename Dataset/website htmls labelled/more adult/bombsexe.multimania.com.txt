PATREON GOALSSome time ago I decided to finally update my Patreon goals so you can get some benefits from supporting me. I think it’s a good moment to annouce them especially when the first one is already reached and now I have to keep the word. First goal gives you an option to, once per month, vote for one of four choosen characters that will appear in my next animation ( commissions don’t count ) so here you have four ladies competing to win a place in animation. From left to right:Verana - corrupted Durid from the AshenvaleUnyra - lost Shaman of the Shadowtooth ClanFarseer Viona - prophet of the Sha’tarKeealle - infamous Warlock of the Blackbinder familyVOTE HERE!You can see the rest of my Patreon goals here.Consider supporting me if you like my works.
