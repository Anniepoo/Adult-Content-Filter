Taking One for the Team
It may look like Penny here is suffering from a psychotic break, but looks are deceiving in this post-morphic-technology world.  On a mission to apprehend two dangerous terrorists, she had them cornered when they used a Free Form Morphic Device to change both of their entire body masses into her breasts, thinking themselves trapped, but safe.
But they didn't know Penny.
"They better give me a damn medal for this," was all she could think to say before she pulled the trigger.

Shipping Error
Roy loved Hooters girls.  So much, in fact, that he had himself changed into an entire shipment of uniforms to be worn by the lovely ladies of a particular Hooters establishment.  The problem is, it was supposed to last for 2 weeks.  It's been 6 months.  You see, there was a mistake made by the postal service, and he was shipped to China instead of Alabama.  How that kind of mistake is made, I don't even want to guess.  But we don't know where in China he was sent to, and it's been difficult trying to find him.
I hope Roy is still having fun, clinging to all those lovely, shapely bodies over there.  He may have no idea what in hell is going on around him, but curves are curves, no matter where you are.
