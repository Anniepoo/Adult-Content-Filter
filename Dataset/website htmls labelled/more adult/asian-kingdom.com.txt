OKAY LEMME TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED AFTER I REBLOGGED THIS A FEW DAYS AGOSo as some ofyou guys know my dad died back in December. He had a 2007 Chevy Silverado that he LOVED, but since neither my mom nor I would drive it, she decided to let the bank come and sell it.Today, she texts me around 3:00 pm with this:we just got an extra $5,711.64 that neither of us expected.Yeah, we’re surprised. lol
Well, fuck
Ok
