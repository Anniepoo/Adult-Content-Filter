A Sissy's Day Off
i sort of had yesterday "off."  With permission already in hand, i left early in the morning to play golf out of town at the invitation of some friends who needed someone to round out their "scramble" foursome.  Whenever such permission is granted, it's always with the understanding that my routine domestic and housewife duties won't fall too far behind.
As demanding as Diane can be, She's still pretty understanding.  She knew i wouldn't be able to do all of my regular Tuesday duties but did ask that i have some light snacks ready when She and four of Her peers came over after work for a casual meeting on a project She's heading.  i had anticipated to be home in plenty of time.  However, i was late getting home because of a frost delay at the golf course and my playing partners' lack of urgency to leave.
By the time i got home (after a trip to the grocery store to pick up some provisions for the snacks) i only had about an hour to shower and get everything ready for Diane's arrival.  When She and Her peers arrived, i was just about finishing up in the kitchen and when everybody came in, i started to serve drinks and then put out the food.
As anticipated my hospitality didn't go unnoticed, particularly after Diane said "he makes a great hostess doesn't he?"
Everyone kind of chuckled and thanked me for what i'd done.  No surprise that one of the woman told Diane how lucky She was.   Diane didn't say much and after a bit of small talk about their project She finally said "I think we're all set.  I'll let you know if we need anything else."  It was a polite way to let everyone know that HER meeting was ready to start.  It was also a subtle (or maybe not-so-subtle) way to dismiss Her submissive.
In a way dismissal was pretty "stinging."  i have plenty of expertise and experience in the area of this particular project Diane is heading.  In fact, She's already asked my opinion on a few things about it in the past few weeks.  None of that mattered at that moment.  She took the opportunity to let everyone know She was in charge.  i exited as gracefully as any domestic servant would have done.  It was a lesson in humility.
And today is a makeup day for my day off yesterday.  Not the pretty kind of makeup.  Instead, it's the kind where you have to makeup for a lost day of housework.
At least i can look pretty while doing it.
love,
sissy terri

Bulls & Cuckolds - The Differences
i apologize for the length of yesterday's post.  If it were a writing assignment of any kind, i would have been lucky to escape with a "D-."  So many things seem to happen on Saturday, all of which seemed somehow connected to the other, i tried to cram everything in.  i still missed some things that weighed on my mind.  One of the hardest things to do when it comes to putting our thoughts to paper is to summarize effectively.  Sunday's lengthy post is a good example.
There is one "cuckold moment" that took place between Diane and i on Saturday night that i'd like to share,  if for no other reason than to point out the differences between bulls and cuckolds.
As i was dutifully pleasing/cleaning Diane shortly after Her arrival from an afternoon spent making love with Paul, She told me what a good time they had and actually thanked me for being so understanding.  i stopped my worshiping only briefly to give Her a "You're welcome Mistress" before returning to my duties.  Then there was this brief exchange...
"You know" She said, "Paul's having some of his friends over tonight to watch the football game.  They're probably all there now having a few beers and enjoying themselves.  You on the other hand are here enjoying my already well satisfied pussy."
Her attitude and sexy taunting increased my arousal while humiliating me at the same time.  This simultaneous kinky twist only caused me to try to please Her even more.  She must have noticed the change in my approach.
"You like that don't you?" She asked and continued before i cold answer, "Doing sissy things while they guy things?"
A brief pause and another "Yes Mistress."
"You sure you wouldn't want to be watching the game with the guys?" She asked.
"Yes Mistress.  Very sure" i said.
"Good, now just continue doing what you're doing" She said.
It was the end of our little discussion and She came a few minutes later.
Pleased with what i had done, She handed my the panty She'd worn to see Paul and told me to start sewing a little bow on it.
It was just another cuckold duty i had to perform while guys everywhere were probably watching the game.
love,

No Secrets & Some Surprises
Given the circumstances that existed while i gave Linda her pedicure yesterday, it's no surprise that a rather sensitive discussion ensued.  While Diane was with Her lover Paul, i was home alone with Diane's friend Linda on my knees in front of her.  She sat on the leather sofa while i gave her a pedicure.  It put me in a very submissive state of mind.
If you read yesterday's post, you know that i'd asked Diane what i should tell Linda if she asked where Diane was.  i was told to tell Linda the truth since Linda knows all about Diane's relationship with Paul and then some.  However unbeknownst to me, after She left here Diane texted Linda to let her know she would be spending the afternoon with Paul and to enjoy her pedicure.
Before the pedicure began, Linda told me she had heard from Diane telling her She was with Paul.  i still felt a bit embarrassed about it but Linda didn't seem phased by it at all.  Instead, She handed me a small two small gifts, a token of appreciation "for all the pedicures you dont charge me for" she said.  Other than a dozen Pro V1 golf balls with a pink side stamp, the two golf related gifts were very vanilla.
But as soon as the pedicure began with a foot bath and some massaging, i felt like the topic of Diane being with Paul while i was here with Linda alone was like the "elephant in the room"; an obvious subject or situation that should be addressed.  The silence was deafening.
"Are you okay with my being here when Diane's with Paul?"  Linda asked me.  "You're a little quiet."
"Of course.  i'm fine" i said, "just not sure what to talk about."  It was kind of a stupid thing to say.  i sounded as if i was pathetically looking for sympathy or something more.  Linda took the opportunity to ask me some pretty direct questions.
"I'm sure it has to bother you sometime" Linda said.  i admitted that it did but not as much as people think.  i added that much of it depended upon the circumstances.
"I understand the inequity in your relationship with Diane.  I get that.  Does that bother you at times.  She gets to play, and you don't.   And what about jealousy?" She asked.
i did my best to explain my feelings to Linda.  All of them.  i spoke frankly and told her how i've done quite well in coping with the jealousy and how i've accepted the inequity that exists in our relationship.  i never had to use the term FemDom or anything like that.  i told her that it was indeed difficult at times.
"i still have many sexual urges" i told her.  "But Diane controls how they're either acted upon or not."
i couldn't help but get a little aroused both from giving Linda her pedicure and what we were talking about.  i could tell Linda sensed that.  Linda broke the silence with a very pointed question.
"Ever have urges for me?" She said.
i was honest and told her i did.  But i also told her that all of them were from the submissive point of view.  "Just being honest.  It's who i am" i said.
"That's very flattering.  Know that I feel kind of the same way.  Most women would.  Who wouldn't love to have a man at their disposal like that?  But I respect what both of you have, and would never do anything to ruin it" She said.  Then she added something that surprised me a bit.  "Diane knows how I feel also.  I've been frank with her too."
i had to ask..."What did She say?"
"She just smiled and laughed a bit.  Told me you were off limits" Linda said.
We both laughed and the mood was lightened a bit.   Before she left, Linda gave me a very innocent kiss on the lips.  It felt nice.
The afternoon made me realize how few secrets i have from Diane.  i've written about this year because one of the sections of our new "contract" deals with my having to tell Her everything and being honest about the desires i have - "No Secrets" is Diane's mantra.  As for Diane, Her relationships and desires aren't really secrets either.  Instead, when She's slow to reveal some things, they're just "surprises."
Diane spent the entire afternoon with Paul.  She was with him until almost 5 PM.  She texted me to let me know that She was "just leaving" his house.  "I'll pick up a take home pizza we can make later" She added.
When She arrived, i asked Her if She had a good time and if She wanted a glass of wine or something.
"Yes I did" She said, "And no I don't.  You have a couple of things to do before we have a drink."
The first was to worship Her where Paul's cock spent much of its time that afternoon.
The second was to sew the first bow of the year onto the panty she wore yesterday.  i think i did a pretty good job, even though it took me a couple of tries.
"I didn't want you drinking before your first sewing assignment" She laughed.
In the end, i felt like a very happy and submissive cuckold.

A Bow on Mistress' Panty
The fashion industry suffered a great loss this week when designer Andre Courreges passed away at the age of 92.  Courreges was the creator of the miniskirt, that marvelous style that captured (and toyed with) the imagination of just about every male when they hit the scene in the 1960's.
The miniskirt may not be as popular and mainstream as it once was, but it will never really go out of style.  Especially with crossdressers who love to show off their sexy legs!  You can read more about Andre and his contributions to fashion here.
Here's an interesting photo shoot from his work in 1968:
While i was busy doing housework this morning, Diane got a call from Paul letting Her know that He was going to be "free" this afternoon and asking if She was "available."  Apparently, he is quite "free" and able to entertain Diane.  This last minute "date" is likely to lead to my having to sew my first little bow onto a pair of Diane's panties.
It's also going to lead to a situation where i'm here at home giving Linda a pedicure while Diane is spending part of the afternoon with Paul.  Diane will be leaving here around noon, while Linda should be arriving about an hour later.  Diane will be getting Her pedicure shortly.  Doing my Wife's nails before She meets Her lover followed by a pedicure for Her best friend wasn't exactly how i thought this day was going to play out.
"What do you want me to tell Linda when she asks where you are?" i asked Diane earlier.
"Just tell her the truth.  I'm with Paul.  It's not like it's a secret" Diane answered.
All this is making for a pretty intense cuckolding day.

Beautiful "Submissive Thoughts"
Blogs that post on a regular basis are pretty interesting to follow, but by the same token (and i'm as guilty of this as anyone), and probably out of necessity to some extent, they tend to repeat or write about the same or very similar things.
For instance, i don't think many people would find it very interesting to hear about my daily chastity percentage, read about my worshiping of Diane the night before or things that seem to happen in our household just about every day. Though Diane is someone who is not always very predictable, She doesn't have a surprise in store for me every day...not even close :)  When She does, it's rare that i don't share it with readers.  i still don
On the other hand there are some bloggers who post ever so rarely but when they do, their words are well chosen and their blogs beautifully written and  worth reading.  These are bloggers whose blogs i keep on my list of links even though they haven't posted in many months.  Rarely a day goes by that i don't glace over at that list in the hopes that they've posted.
Well yesterday, a new post at one of those favorite blogs of mine showed up and it was a delightful read.  Not only was it well written, but the news it contained about my friend Marissa made me happy for her.  The blog i'm talking about is "Marissa's Lens - Thoughts on the Life of a Submissive."
i really hope that Marissa posts more frequently, but i understand if she doesn't and will still look forward to reading her blog whenever she does.  But take a moment to check out her blog on fetblogger.
As for updates here, chastity is at 100% for 2016 and at 94.25% since we started this "thing."  As for my first "sewing assignment" to put a pretty little bow on Diane's panties, it hasn't happened yet.  Both She and Paul have been too busy this weekend to get together, but there's a good possibility next week may have an entry on the Cuckold Calendar."
Finally, tomorrow Diane's friend Linda has an appointment with me for a pedicure in the afternoon.  In case anybody's interested, i still have a couple of openings :)

When Permission is Required
Most people would define a successful relationship or marriage as one where both partners view the other, or work together as equals.  Those of us who by choice prefer a Female Led Relationship (FLR) certainly don't fit that definition even though our relationships can often be as or more successful than more traditional ones.
Yet there is plenty of equality in a FLR.  The equality exists in the things we do for, or provide to, each other.  Each of us fulfills a need that pleases the other and as such, makes them happy and fulfilled.  We fulfill those needs for the other equally, just in different ways.
The reality of a FLR, specifically those little things that take place that help make it what it is, doesn't provide instant gratification or happiness.  That's especially true for the submissive.  The discussion between Diane and i that took place this morning is a good example of what i'm talking about.
As residents of the American southwest we're in the midst of what's supposed to be a very wet and rainy winter, the result of what could be one of the most powerful El Nino effects in years.  We're also getting some unusually heavy snow in the higher elevations and a small ski area that's most often closed during the winter will be open in the next couple of days.  I asked Diane if She would like to go skiing one day this weekend.
"I don't think so" She answered.  "We've got a lot going on."
"Can i go tomorrow or Friday?" i asked Her.  "Would You mind."  i've already been corrected on how to properly ask permission.  Asking Her if She "would mind" is acceptable, only if i ask for permission first.
"You can, but you'll have to do it in chastity" She said instantly.
For all intents and purposes, it was the end of the discussion.  Her answer eliminated the need for follow-up question.  Had She said i could, i would have asked if i could remove my chastity device.  It's one thing to play golf in chastity.  Skiing is another.  There's too great a risk.  She could sense my disappointment.
"We'll get to ski this winter.  It's still early in the season" She said.
And so i wait, and remain locked.
In the big picture of our FLR my submissive needs are somehow met by the requirement that i ask for permission to these types of things.  But in the reality of the moment, i often miss the big picture.

Celebrating Chasity
My sissy is playing golf today securely locked in her pink CB-3000.  I've heard that some wives kiss their husbands balls for good luck before they head to the course.  That is soooo not ME!  But I did wish her luck and got a nice kiss on my bottom before I left for work this morning :)
Yesterday I received an email from a reader with the following attachement:
"Mike" wanted to know if I had any special plans for this day.  Up to then I hadn't thought about it.  However I do have plenty to celebrate and I'll do my best to make it a memorable day for the both of us.  Any suggestions?
And by the way, last year at this time terri had only spent 70% of the time locked up.  Can you guess where she's at this year?
kisses,
Diane
