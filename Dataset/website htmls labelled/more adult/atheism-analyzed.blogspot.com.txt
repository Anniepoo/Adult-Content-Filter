Atheism Analyzed
A former 40 year Atheist analyzes Atheism, without resorting to theism, deism, or fantasy.***If You Don't Value Truth, Then What DO You Value?***If we say that the sane can be coaxed and persuaded to rationality, and we say that rationality presupposes logic, then what can we say of those who actively reject logic?***Atheists have an obligation to give reasons in the form of logic and evidence for rejecting Theist theories.

The Narrative Is Safe With Hillary

Excerpt of the Day
This is who profits from perpetual outrage:
This Is the Hollowed-Out World That Outrage Culture Has Created
Shamelessness. That’s the key.
Shamelessness is what our system is actively selecting for. You might even say we’re breeding for it. You have to breed for it, when you think about it. What normal, well-adjusted person would sell their soul, exaggerate their worst tendencies, suppress their self-awareness, just to get attention? What sane person would willingly subject themselves to a system that flays and mocks and criticize and screams? Who finds being yelled at or publicly derided simply a cost of doing business (poorly)?
A shocking amount of people, it turns out.
Unfortunately, none of them are the people you might hope for. The cartoonist Scott Adams, apologizing during a major incident over a minor flap a few years ago, wrote that “Ideas are society’s fuel. I drill a lot of wells; most of them are dry. Sometimes they produce. Sometimes the well catches on fire.” People like Adams—valuable cultural contributors—are losing the ability to take creative risks. A good person who happened to have said something dumb in an email once, or took a private naked photo, might have their willingness to drill those wells (as Adams put it) utterly destroyed, while others—due to their calculated shamelessness and delusional imperviousness—continue to operate with impunity, untouched.
Just look at Donald Trump. A Yale Professor is driven to resign over the microaggressions in an email while someone like him can stand on the national stage and spew ignorance and hate.
It’s a hollowing out of our world. The good employees are quitting and the terrible are made intractable and untouchable. The people who thrive are the ones who we wish would go away, and the people we value most as cultural contributors lurk in the back of the room, hoping not to get noticed and hurt.
At this point, everything in-between—vulnerability, nuance, truth—may as well not exist. When our culture encourages the fakeness and stupidity and trolling it is supposedly trying to rail against, there is no room for anything else.
And with these incentives we have decided to create, it’s almost certain this point will fall on deaf ears. It’s too subtle to cut through the noise.The race-baiters, the man-hating feminists, the abortionistas, all of these cannot be touched: they are shameless. Shame requires both an objective, external moral code and a conscience. When the moral code is Consequentialism, there is no conscience required. Atrophy of the conscience results, and shamelessness is inevitable.

Evidence that Polar Bears and their prey seals have existed through multiple periods of complete sea-ice-free Arctic temperature cycles:
Biological response to climate change in the Arctic Ocean:
the view from the past
If, as DNA and fossil evidence
suggests, polar bears and their primary prey, ringed
seals and other prey such as walruses, have existed
for at least 125 ka and likely hundreds of thousands of
years, then they experienced extreme climate conditions
of glacial periods as well as partially or completely
summer sea-ice-free interglacial periods (MIS 11, MIS 5
and the early Holocene). Microfossil proxy evidence for
southward expansion of sea ice during glacial periods
implies that vertebrate species that are dependent on sea
ice habitat might have also migrated southward into the
Nordic and Bering Sea-North Pacific regions.The earth and its denizens have survived global warming before, multiple times. But the AGW Narrative and Panic Pushers will not likely change their hysterical position of Deadly Doom. It's how they make their living.

Jihadis Learn to Die Rather Than Run
ISIS Burns Its Own Jihadis Alive After Losing Ramadi to the Iraqi Army
In what's just more proof that ISIS is by far the most diabolical terrorist organization in the world, Fox News reports that its leaders burned their own jihadists alive because they fled when the Iraqi city of Mosul was attacked by the Iraqi army.
ISIS fighters who fled to the terror group’s Iraqi stronghold of Mosul after being defeated in Ramadi were burned alive in the town square, sources told FoxNews.com, in an unmistakable message to fighters who may soon be defending the northern city from government forces.
Several residents of Mosul recounted the grisly story for stateside relatives, describing the deadly reception black clad jihadists got when they made it to Mosul, some 250 miles north of the city retaken by Iraqi forces operating with cover from U.S. air power.
A former resident of Mosul who now lives in the U.S. says that his family back home told him what happened:
They were grouped together and made to stand in a circle, and set on fire to die.
Several other Iraqi refugees have heard similar stories from family members still in Mosul. Michael Pregent, a terrorism expert and former intelligence adviser to Gen. David Petraeus, says this kind of brutality -- even towards its own fighters -- is nothing new for ISIS:
There is no surprise on executing ISIS fighters from Ramadi. They did the same to fighters after Tikrit.
The "sin'"of the executed jihadis is that they didn't fight to the death when Ramadi -- an important strategic city in Iraq -- was attacked and eventually retaken by the Iraqi army (with air support from the U.S.). Apparently not dying in battle is a deadly sin in the eyes of ISIS's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. And he means that literally. This group doesn't just kill outsiders, as other terror groups do, but even its own members.
And they don't get their 72 virgins, either.

Why The GOP Establishment Hates Trump and Cruz
From Red State:
The anger at Trump is more the result of the feeling that he has betrayed his class by seeking the approval of the rubes in flyover country.The vitriol tossed towards Ted Cruz though indicates that his vision of a corrupt establishment that has forfeited the Mandate of Heaven. What is worse is that they know they are dealing with an honest man who believes in what he preaches, he doesn’t, like many of his critics, mouth platitudes then sneer at the people who elected them. When the establishment wooed Rubio, the Gang of Eight amnesty bill was the product. When Ted Cruz was appointed vice chairman of the NRSC he fought to keep that organization out of primaries and then left it when it would not stop acting as an incumbent protection racket.
These people see their gravy train coming to an end. They see the curtain falling on Failure Theater. They are pissed, they are angry, they don’t understand the mood in the GOP, and they are striking out.Put them in the dustbin of history. Handcuff them and return them to the Democrats.

Useless Republicans
The Beloved Migrant's Victimhhood Class and the Beloved Principle of Multiculturalism are in Drect Conflict with the Beloved Women’s Victimhood Status.
Taharrush Comes To the EU
The principle of Taharrush is becoming a household word, like jihad and takiyya. Takharrush is now known as sexual abuse against women by groups of men. It is an Arabic cultural phenomenon which grew out of the use of the word to describe sexual abuse of children,
and is now expanded to include sexual abuse and rape of women.
I have found two studies on the subject of taharrush. This practice of a group of men surrounding a woman and assaulting her by word and hand groping of “all orifices” and sometimes rape began apparently in Egypt.
The rationale is this: The original culture of female dominance in the home and male dominance in supplying the home with financial stability and physical protection has become damaged. During the 20th century, modernization came to Egypt under both Nasser’s socialism, and Sadat’s reforms. Most notably, females were made equal to men, and men lost jobs (to women and other modern reasons).
The hyper masculine culture could not withstand the reduction of masculinity, especially in the lower classes, where males experienced high unemployment. The males, still operating under the traditional form of masculinity, gathered daily in the streets, especially in Cairo. They began to reassert their masculine dominance of
women, who they still considered chattel under Islamic law. The ability to attack the women seems enhanced by the concept of sex with slave girls, even if the slavery is temporary, say for minutes.
Thus as displays of masculinity, primarily to impress their compatriots, men would form a wall around any woman, any age, any nationality including tourists, and then would sexually fondle the woman, taunt her, and sometimes rape her, right there in the street in broad daylight. Apparently this restored the masculinity of the men, at least in the eyes of the other men at the scene, and self-image was restored. At least to the attacker. [Note 1]
Thought of the woman, her feelings and rights, never enters their minds. The woman is fair game under the principles of Islam.
This is the concept of Taharrush. If this constitutes an understanding of it, it certainly does not constitute approval of it in the minutest. Taharrush is barbaric, it is based in the cruelties of a barbaric worldview which degrades both men and women, and yet is a worldwide system which generates violent adherents intent on conquest.
If you have seen the videos on YouTube of the refugees trying to mount trucks going under the channel to England, you know that they are almost all young adult males with nothing, many not even with backpacks. According to the studies, these are the exact demographic which uses Taharrush to bolster their self-esteem. If this is the case, and it is, then the mass molestations and rapes are an expectation, not a deviation. And it explains the high number of rapes suffered by Muslim women in the river of refugees, as well.
Leftist Conundrum
It also explains why the government and police have been burying the news, much less statistics, regarding the epidemic of attacks both on European women and on refugee women. Taharrush reflects badly on multiculturalism.
Apparently multiculturalism is a higher priority than the safety of the Victimhood Classes of women attacked under the culture of Taharrush. That had been a closely held secret, until the New Year’s Eve attacks in Cologne. Now the news is out, and the existence of Taharrush is now known across a wide swath of Europe. But many women had to be attacked before the authorities admitted the problem.
Europe’s response has been to a) blame women; b) assert aggressive gun control; c) claim a need for “education” of refugee men; d) fear for the safety of the refugees due to reprisals.
Let’s analyze just a bit. a) it is not women’s fault; b) gun control is to protect the refugee barbarians, not to stop the attacks; c) educating several millennia of acculturation out of these men is not likely.
These men already espouse a hatred of their new countries, shouting Fuck [everything]. They have been taught barbarism since childhood and now they are reduced to barbarous conditions where they are subservient to everyone, including anyone who helps them. This will not be easily remedied, especially not with Leftist dream-tropes. And d), fear for the safety of the migrants is a valid concern, if not the most pressing. It will become more urgent as the EU fumbles and fails to deal properly with the influx of barbarism into itself.
The Multicultural Paradox
The gap of cultures between barbarism and women’s rights is a formidable chasm. The Merkel style of fawning support for it fails to acknowledge the inherent paradox, the internal contradiction which infects multiculturalism. It is this: Multiculturalism assumes that all cultures are like the culture of the multiculturist in that all cultures actually want to coexist in a western cultural fashion.
But multiculturalism cannot accommodate any culture which does not want to coexist with western culture. This obvious truth is highly visible in major portions of the world, from the Atheist countries of China, Russia, North Korea, Cuba to the Islamic countries around the world from Malaysia to North Africa and the entire Middle East.
Under strict politically correct multiculturalism, all of these who want to destroy the western cultures must be allowed into the west, even illegally. The presupposition of assimilation is understood, if not stated. But it cannot happen. Multiculturalism depends on the cultures being alike in their fundamental concepts, not differing radically, as do Atheist Communism, Atheist Fascism and Qur'anic Islam.
So multiculturalism cannot be very “multi”; it must restrict itself to cultures which are already very much like itself. If it is truly “multi”, then it will kill itself with death by immigrant. So true multiculturism cannot ever
be true multiculturism, and that is a logical paradox.
Back in the USA
The rapes of many if not most of the females who are attempting to enter the US illegally from the border with Mexico represents a similar problem for multiculturalism. Entering also are the rapists, along with people who want the largesse of US government handouts (which are now considerable). Undoubtedly many will work. Undoubtedly many will be satisfied with their new-found taxpayer support.

Men
and
Sexual Harassment
•
Results show that the vast majority - 62.4%
of the male audience surveyed - confirmed
that they have perpetrated and/or continue to
perpetrate one or more of the forms of
harassment. 49.8% being ogling women’s
bodies, 27.7% whistling and shouting
comments, 15.9% shouting sexually explicit
comments, 15.4% phone harassment, 13.4
unwanted touching of womens bodies,
12.2% following and stalking, 4.3% exposed
or pointed out his penis.
•
Results confirmed that the majority of these
incidences take place in public places: 69%
on the streets, 49.1% on public
transportation, 42.4% in parks and coffee
shops, 29% in educational institutions,
19.8% on beaches, and 6.2% in the
workplace.
•
Most participants stated they prefer to harass
in the evening, followed by mid-day, no
specific time, morning, and after midnight.
•
Regarding frequency of harassing behavior,
the vast majority of male participants stated
they harassed women approximately once a
day, while others stated they did so more
than once a day. The minority harassed
weekly and then monthly.
•
Regarding reasons for the harassing
behavior, results show that the vast majority
of harassers 41.8% believe that harassing
behavior works to satisfy their repressed
sexual desires, perhaps confirming the above
classification of the bull harasser who
indiscriminantly looks to satisfy his sexual
desire at any time or place with any females
he sees.
•
23.1% of the men surveyed reported that
harassing women made them feel more
masculine, more confident, stronger in
relation to women, powerful. 13.9%
considered harassing degrading and
humiliating to women, and agreed with the
conclusion that sexual harassment enhances
the already existing culture of male
hegemony through acts of violence by men
against women.
•
19.3% said that they experience no positive
or negative feelings when they harass
women because they are accustomed to
doing it since they were young.
•
Results indicate that 53.8% of men blame
men’s sexual harassment of women on the
women. They interpret the cause of sexual
harassment primarily as a result of women
dressing indecently (unveiled). However,
our study shows that most victims of
harassment wear headscarves, illustrating
the falseness of this claim. 42.4% of men
also attributed harassment to women’s
beauty. One of the interviewees said that
when he sees a beautiful woman he tries to
harass her verbally first and then sees how it
might develop further. Others said that they
harass women because women enjoy it.
27.7% reported that they harass women to
satisfy their sexual desire, or to pass the
time, or to increase self-confidence. When
we analyzed these responses, we found that
all reflect the idea of masculine hegemony.
Usually men blame women, not themselves,
describing her appearance as inappropriate
or saying that she initiated it or likes to be
harassed.

The Left and Concern for Women
"JOHN HINDERAKER ON EUROPE’S RAPE COVERUPS: “What I find inexplicable is the European liberals’ lack of concern for the young women who have been violated. In their political calculations, the women do not appear to figure at all. It’s almost like they were all Kennedys or Clintons.”
Plus: “As in Europe, New York’s political class doesn’t really care what happens to citizens. It’s all about their power.”
Ed Driscoll at InstapunditWhen there is any conflict between two victimhood Classes (Women and Muslims) the Leftist Messiah Class will always a) cover up; b) protect their power base first and foremost.

Questions
Assume that there is a set of principles, [X], which are grounded absolutes.
Conditions:Party A believes in, and lives by, all the principles of [X].
Party B believes in some of, but not all, the principles of [X], and claims that major portions of [X] must evolve due to the cultural advancement of humans.
Questions:Which party deserves the title "Xist", who believes in "Xism"?
Which party deserves the title, "radical"? Or "apostate"? Or "heretic"?
Now refer to the prior article, just below. Then return for the rest here (or just read on, as you choose).
If "peaceful Muslims" dishonor Islam, then why are they NOT the radicals, rather than the 100% faithful Islamists? Of course, they are, but in the parlance of the Leftist accommodationists, inversion of terminology is frequently necessary in order to further the cause, the Leftist Narrative.
A prime example of that is the new use of the term, "anti-Islamic", for actions of the actual adherents of the grounded rules of Islam. Only the passionate adherents of a Narrative, taken over truth and common sense, would do such a thing.
Plus, it is the Party B, above, which more closely matches the approach of the Left, in the practice of modifying rules and morals to match whichever way the culture goes. Or more specifically, how any person chooses to "reinterpret" or even reject rules at any given moment. In other words it is intellectual and moral anarchy.
Given the obvious worldview anarchy of those in Party B as well as the Left, they all should be called Atheist. They reject any grounded "revealed" and absolute values which they don't like at a particular moment. They place themselves and their own desires and authority higher than anyone else.
They are the Radicals.

In France: Teen Slasher Invokes ISIS and More
Teen slasher of Jewish teacher in France cites Islamic State
PARIS (AP) -- A teenager armed with a machete slashed a Jewish teacher in a Marseille street on Monday, invoking the Islamic State group and saying he had also planned to go after police, a French prosecutor said.
The 15-year-old Turkish Kurd was arrested soon after wordlessly attacking the teacher, who was injured in the attack in central Marseille, said Brice Robin, the Marseille prosecutor. The teen invoked Allah and the extremist group only after he was detained, saying "the Muslims of France dishonor Islam and the French army protects Jews."

Headline of the Day
THEY WANT TO GO BACK HOME: The Clintons are longing to find UFOs.Even better, is the actual story:
If elected president, Hillary Clinton promises to tell the truth about the government’s secret work with space aliens — as if she’s capable of speaking the truth about anything.
Would Clinton investigate UFOs and Area 51 (the top-secret Air Force base in Nevada that fervid rumors call the home of the feds’ supposed alien investigations)? The question came in an interview with The Conway (NH) Daily Sun.
Her answer: “Yes, I’m going to get to the bottom of it. I think we may already have been [visited by aliens]. We don’t know for sure.”
Let’s wind that back. First instinct: Pander to the questioner. Second: Cover yourself with all the folks who know better. Third: Fudge to avoid getting pinned down by either side.
Not much different from her response on real issues — like her we’ll-get-to-the-bottom-of-Benghazi promise. (At least she didn’t try to blame an Internet video for flying saucers . . .)
On top of that, Clinton hinted she might create a presidential task force to investigate Area 51.
This turns out to be a running thing for the Clintons. According to old-time Clintonite Webb Hubbell, Bill gave him a mission back in the ’90s, as Hubbell was becoming a top Justice Department official: “I want you to find the answers to two questions for me. One, who killed JFK? And two, are there UFOs?”
As The Post’s late, great Washington Bureau chief, Deborah Orin, later noted, “Hubbell describes his failure to find out about JFK and UFOs as a big regret when he had to resign” to plead guilty to bilking law clients back in Arkansas.

One of the Other Clinton Crimes - this one is Bill's
America, Cut Him Loose
(2001)
The president who hung a ”For Rent” sign on the door to the Lincoln Bedroom also conducted a clearance sale on pardons in his last weird sleepless days in the White House.
The fallout from those pardons is threatening to destroy Mr. Clinton, and perhaps also his wife, the junior senator from New York. He may finally be getting his due.
The Clintons can spin this however they want. But the simple truth is that the way in which some of the pardons were granted seems to fit neatly with the standard definition of a bribe, which is the promise of money or gifts — something of value — to influence the action or behavior of an official.
Marc Rich was one of the U.S. government’s 10 most wanted fugitives. He was accused, among other things, of wire fraud, racketeering, evading $48 million in taxes in what prosecutors described as the largest tax avoidance scheme in U.S. history, and violating the trade embargo against Iran during the hostage crisis.
Do we think something of value was exchanged for Mr. Clinton’s pardon of Mr. Rich? Or do we think Mr. Clinton went to bat for this billionaire fugitive because, darn it, it was the right thing to do?
Federal prosecutors have launched a criminal investigation of the Rich pardon as well as Mr. Clinton’s decision to grant clemency to four Hasidic men who stole tens of millions of dollars from government agencies. The four men were from New Square, N.Y., a village in Rockland County that voted almost unanimously — 1,400 to 12 — for Hillary Clinton in last year’s Senate race.
Mrs. Clinton met with New Square’s religious leader, Rabbi David Twersky, during the Senate campaign. And in December, after winning the election, she and Mr. Clinton met at the White House with the rabbi.
Was there an understanding? Did the quids hook up with the quos in an illegal votes-for-clemency scheme? Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, is trying to find out.
The Clintons may or may not be led away in handcuffs someday. But whatever happens with the criminal investigations, it’s time for the Democratic Party to wise up. Ostracism would be a good first step.
Instapundit says:
Still waiting on the handcuffs. And the Democrats are too short on talent to write the Clintons off.

From the (not too) Distant Past: It's NOT Islamic Terrorism!
Government renames Islamic terrorism as 'anti-Islamic activity' to woo Muslims
By JAMES SLACK
Last updated at 22:16 17 January 2008
Ministers have adopted a new language for declarations on Islamic terrorism.
In future, fanatics will be referred to as pursuing "anti-Islamic activity".
Home Secretary Jacqui Smith said that extremists were behaving contrary to their faith, rather than acting in the name of Islam.
Security officials believe that directly linking terrorism to Islam is inflammatory, and risks alienating mainstream Muslim opinion.
In her first major speech on radicalisation, Miss Smith repeatedly used the phrase "anti-Islamic".
In one passage she said: "As so many Muslims in the UK and across the world have pointed out, there is nothing Islamic about the wish to terrorise, nothing Islamic about plotting murder, pain and grief.
"Indeed, if anything, these actions are anti-Islamic'.
Another section referred to enlisting the Muslim community against "anti-Islamic activity".
Her words were chosen to reflect new Government strategy on labelling the terrorists and their recruiting agents.
The shift follows a decision taken last year to stop using the phrase "war on terror", first adopted by U.S. President Bush.
Officials were concerned it could act as a recruiting tool for Al Qaeda, which is determined to manufacture a battle between the values of Islam and the West.
The strategy emerging across Government is to portray terrorists as nothing more than cold-blooded murderers who are not fighting for any religious cause.
Al Qaeda inspired terrorism is instead being described by key figures as "more like a death cult".
Last night the Home Office stressed that no phrases have been "banned".
But senior Whitehall sources have made it clear that the "war on terror" and "Islamic extremism" will not be used again by people at the top of Government or those involved in counterterrorism strategy.
And Now There's This:It's NEVER Islam: Shot/Chaser in Philadelphia
So just how delusional is Edward Archer, pictured above (and below), the chap who ran up to Police Officer Jesse Hartnett’s cruiser on the streets of Philadelphia and, brandishing a stolen police revolver, unleashed a hail of bullets, wounding Hartnett? Archer, a recent convert to ISIS, said he did it “in the name of Islam.” That's the shot. And here's the chaser:
according to Jim Kenney (D), the mayor of Philadelphia, Archer is so delusional he only thinks he did it in the name of Islam. Clicking on the macro labelled “Islam has nothing to do with it,” Kenney burbled the tired rejoinder:
“In no way shape or form does anyone in this room believe that Islam or the teaching of Islam has anything to do with what you’ve seen on the screen.”
Is that so, Jim?
Reporting on Kenney’s preposterous response, Breitbart made this amusing observation: “Kenney, a Catholic, received his bachelor’s degree from La Salle University, and it remains unclear where his religious expertise concerning Islam derives from.”

In Sweden, Another Immigrant Sex Attack Cover-up Is Exposed
Exposing Major PC Cover-up in Sweden –
Leading Daily Dagens Nyheter Refused to Write About Cologne-like Sex Crimes in Central Stockholm
"STOCKHOLM The Cologne sex assault on New Year’s Eve, where groups of Arab and North African men groped more than a hundred German women, has shocked Europe this last week. But a very similar incident, with a large number of perpetrators and victims, took place in the Swedish capital last summer. That incident however was silenced by large Swedish newspapers and media companies, despite repeated attempts from police officers to contact journalists. This is how leading Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter tried to cover up a politically inconvenient sex assault story."When facts go counter to the Leftist Narrative, always choose the Narrative.

Fantasy Islam: Islamophilia is the Result of Ignorance of Islamic Dogmatic Texts
The Left is completely under the spell of fantasy Islam. What they claim to be "radical" behaviors are, in fact, sanctioned by the Qur'an and the Hadiths. Under Leftist-Marxist class war, however, Islam is a protected class and as such cannot be other than a Victimhood Class. Nothing about a Victimhood Class can be evil. Official Victims only ever "act out" against their Oppressor Class (the class which always devolves to white males). Acting out is an expectation.
So it is that the adherents to the revealed word of Allah and the model of the life of Muhammad are falsely portrayed as "radicals", ostensibly deviants from actual Islam. The reality is that they are true to actual Islamic law, while the Peaceful Muslims are the ones who deviate from the Laws of Islam, and they are therefore the heretics who will ultimately be punished by the sword or AK47.

Sura 4:24 extends to all Muslim men the license given to jihad warriors in sura 33:50: O Prophet! We have made lawful to thee thy wives to whom thou hast paid their dowers, and those whom thy right hand possesses out of the captives of war whom Allah has assigned to thee. [Emphasis added.]
As I related in the column linked above, Robert Spencer has noted that the sharia manual Reliance of the Traveller — which is endorsed by, among other influential Islamic leaders, both the scholars of al-Azhar University (the seat of Sunni sharia scholarship since the tenth century) and the International Institute of Islamic Thought (the Muslim Brotherhood’s think-tank) — explains that “When a child or a woman is taken captive, they become slaves by the fact of capture, and the woman’s marriage is immediately annulled.”
The point of this decree, Robert elaborates, is that the captive woman is then available for sex slavery, as prescribed in the above quoted scriptures. Moreover, as he also points out, the practice of forcing sex on captive women is implicitly permitted in the hadith — authoritative collections of the prophet Mohammed’s words and deeds, which, like the Koran, have scriptural status and form the basis for sharia law. Robert quotes from the Sahih Muslim collection (Book 8, No. 3371, scroll down from here):
We went out with Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) on the expedition to the Bi’l-Mustaliq and took captive some excellent Arab women; and we desired them, for we were suffering from the absence of our wives, (but at the same time) we also desired ransom for them. So we decided to have sexual intercourse with them but by observing ’azl ([i.e.,] withdrawing the male sexual organ before emission of semen to avoid-conception). But we said: We are doing an act whereas Allah’s Messenger is amongst us; why not ask him? So we asked Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him), and he said: It does not matter if you do not do it, for every soul that is to be born up to the Day of Resurrection will be born.
The hadith plainly demonstrates that, from the standpoint of Islamic law, the only question was whether coitus interruptus was permissible; the permissibility of forcing sex on the captive women was obvious and assumed. Given what the Koran explicitly says, how could it be otherwise?...
Knowing that Westerners are unfamiliar with Islamic scripture, Islamist apologists deceptively scoff at the notion that something as heinous as sex slavery could have roots in Muslim doctrine. Since people of good will desperately want to believe this is the case, they avoid researching the matter and are all too ready to assume that anyone who would suggest such a thing simply must be a slanderous Islamophobe.
On the other hand, Islamic audiences know the scriptures and are taught that they are the verbatim instructions of Allah. It is further inculcated in them from childhood that anyone who attempts to repeal, criticize, or interpret Islamic scripture in a manner contradictory of ancient Islamic teaching is guilty of blasphemy — and of apostasy if the person making the attempt is a Muslim. Sharia makes those offenses punishable by death.

An Interview With David Silverman
Meet the Fox News atheist —
the man Bill O’Reilly calls a fascist and Sean Hannity thinks is evil
[Ed.: My comments are in brackets and bold, just like this. Caution: sarcasm ahead.]
"I asked him what his goal was.
“I’m not seeking to outlaw religion,” he answered.[Remember this when you read further down]
“Every American has the right to practice a religion. But we would be a freer state, healthier, if we dropped the myths of yesteryear. We’d be a more knowledgeable country. Just look at Scandinavia. We see the positive effects of atheism there.”
[Oh yes! Ya gotta love what has been done to Scandinavian countries by the AtheoLeft]
The most critical flaw of faith, he told me, was the notion it offers of an “objective morality” – that is, unquestionable, immutable, heaven-decreed moral absolutes that cannot evolve as our consciousness does. “The lie of objective morality that make people do bad things and think they’re doing good,” with ISIS atrocities and attacks on abortion clinics serving as obvious examples thereof. Such murderers “think they’re doing God’s work, they think they’re doing good.”[All religion is ISIS and abortion abbatoir attackers; that’s a revelation]
I asked why he chose the present moment to publish “Fighting God.”
“We’re seeing this rise in religious hatred all over the world,” he said, “and a pushback against criticizing religion. Yet religion is the problem. [Well, it's not the problem in China, Russia, Cuba, Venezuela, Scandinavia, the EU, etc.
And not all religion.]
We see its influence all over, in abortion, gay rights, climate change. [Oh my yes. To be against killing one’s progeny, rampant buggering, and data molesting is defined as EVIL – objective and TRUE EVIL. It has been revealed as such by… the evangelist Silverman! So it is an objective absolute.]
In Europe, the rise of Islam” – especially with the influx of Muslim refugees – “is leading to the rise of firebrand atheism, as atheists are being pushed into realizing that they have something to fight, and something to defend.
[Hm. So it’s only Atheists who realize this? Who Knew? Atheists must be the Islamophobes everyone talks about.]
In Heidelberg and Basil and Zurich I spoke to packed crowds who wanted to know more about firebrand atheism because of the fear of the rise of Islam.[Wait, it’s ALL religion, right? Why just Islam?]
Religion is hurting our species, it’s hurting the entire world, and yet we protect it.
[That’s better. It IS all religion, then.]
We need to put religion in its place, which is back in the church.” He paused. “Religion is a scam, a lie codified in our society, demanding respect, even from the non-religious, and cannot be challenged.
[So – you had to go to Europe to challenge religion? It's codified in the USA? Like a law? Again, who knew? I could swear that you have challenged religion for a living in the USA.]
But religious opinions are opinions just like any other opinions. It’s about time for the lie to come to an end, for the lie to die.”[So religion is a lie, which is to die? And not to be allowed? OK, then. That’s what I thought you were all about! Now confirmed.]
“How exactly is it a scam?”
“A scam takes money from people for a promise that’s never kept. Religion tells people they will get to heaven. But they never get to heaven. [Alriiiight! Promise never kept! There's no heaven! There must be facts and data coming next to support this claim; I can’t wait!]
Religion lies, takes money, funnels money to preachers and then demands respect.
[Whoa, what happened to the PROOF?
This is not proof. It is a blanket condemnation based on lack of evidence cum ignorance of actual religion. Again where is the objective empirical proof for this? Obviously it's not required, since the Atheist evangelist has declared "religion" to be EVIL... absolutely, objectively, morally EVIL. So it's the Atheist MORAL CODE.]
No really powerful god would have to demand respect. So I refuse to give respect.”
[Oh, now I understand. You know precisely what a deity would do, because… um, why?]
Does disrespecting faith work as a tactic?
“Yes! When no one shows disrespect for religion, those inside the churches feel afraid and abandoned.
[Oh man. You are so powerful that believers actually cower at your disrespect? Impressive!]
Yet religion deserves no more respect than tarot cards or astrology.
[Uh oh. Bad analogy. Those things can be tested empirically.]
This is an outreach effort to those inside the churches.
[Oh yes! Those inside churches are desperate to hear how superior you are to them and their inferior, backward ways which you disrespect with such splendiferous arrogance and intellectual emptiness. Yes, that’ll work.]
We’re saying, you can get out! We can grow the movement by spreading atheism, but also by getting atheists who don’t call themselves atheists to call themselves what they are.[So they're all held captive in there? And your Atheism will free them to hate like you do? That’s the way to dream.]
Ninety percent of atheists don’t call themselves atheists; the real number [of atheists] isn’t 3 percent but 35 percent.
[Not according to the experts who take the polls.]
All I need to do to multiply the movement by a factor of ten is get atheists to call themselves atheists, we don’t have to change opinions about God. There are even atheists behind pulpits.”
[Yes. Dream the Dream! So many people can't wait to hate... you can lead the way!]
What Silverman is cannot be characterized as evidence-based, logic-based or rational; he is an evangelist who spouts hatred for religion. In other words, an evangelistic hate monger in pseudo-rational clothes.
There is more at the SITE, but I stopped here because it is enough to demonstrate the “thought” process of the guy.

Atheists Misunderstand the Pope
Atheist wishful thinking: "Yeah, I'll go to heaven without believing it exists: Cool!"
Pope Francis assures atheists: You don’t have to believe in God to go to heaven
“You ask me if the God of the Christians forgives those who don’t believe and who don’t seek the faith. I start by saying – and this is the fundamental thing – that God’s mercy has no limits if you go to him with a sincere and contrite heart. The issue for those who do not believe in God is to obey their conscience.
“Sin, even for those who have no faith, exists when people disobey their conscience.”
Of course, what this really says is, "Go to him" sincerely and contritely; that is the condition for receiving God's Mercy. And that is not Atheism any more, is it?
[A: no it is not].
Further, to obey one's conscience is another way of saying, listen to the God inside you - the Holy Spirit. Atheists listen to their appetites and proclivities, then declare that to be "rational". And most have long since declared their superiority, intellectually and morally, not only to believers, but to God and certainly the Pope.
The false belief that the Pope says they need not believe in order to receive access to heaven will only serve to confirm their "specialness" in their already elitist minds.
Most actual Atheists have no chance of meeting the Pope's criteria. That's because these critieria are defining a believer, not an Atheist.

Quote of the Day #2
I love this election year!
"And then, as Jeffrey Epstein’s flight attendant once said, Bill Clinton comes out of nowhere to bite her on the ass.
Whereas Bill was supposed to be Hillary’s “not-so secret weapon,” he’s now a liability. It’s schadenfreudetastic to watch liberals forced to choose between the Scylla of the Hillary campaign and the Charybdis of the feminist project.
Of course, liberals are mad at#…#conservatives (and Donald Trump) for pointing it out. I particularly love the subhead on this Slate piece. “The right hopes to turn the feminist consensus on rape against the Clintons.” Ah yes, those terrible conservatives, how dare they take feminists seriously!"

Regarding Islamic Integration Into Western Society
New in America: Not Muslim, No Taxi
Islamic taxi drivers at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport are refusing passengers carrying alcohol and blind folks with seeing-eye dogs because the animals' saliva is sacrilege according to Sharia law.
The enterprising Muslims during the past year have stranded 100 passengers a month, sometimes for more than an hour, according to the Metropolitan Airports Commission, since three-fourths of the 900 taxi drivers servicing the airport are Somali Muslims who have decided to participate in the new discipline.
To make matters worse, a local outreach director of the ever-obliging Council on American-Islamic Relations, Damon Drake, dismissed the issue, saying, "Now that the Muslims are here, they need to be accommodated."
The issue originated 12 months ago when the airports commission received a fatwa, or religious edict, from the Minnesota chapter of the Muslim American Society. It stated that "Islamic jurisprudence" prohibits taxi drivers to carry passengers with alcohol "because it involves cooperating in sin."
One solution, Islamic zealots suggested, would be to designate the majority of cabs following the practice with special colors, or lights, so that passengers would not hold their breath — which is tantamount to telling a newly stranded passenger: "I am Muslim, and I choose not to give you a ride. Tough luck."
This plan was abandoned when airport officials determined that it might cause people to avoid using taxis altogether.
It is not possible to massage this into further outrage, but there is plenty of need to wonder about wider meanings and consequences, not to mention why such a situation was allowed to drag on with no decisive action to date.
Even if one could dismiss such shenanigans as a humorous episode that escaped nationwide attention until recently and will soon go away, what of the next challenge?
What if Islamic drivers deny the right of transportation to women wearing short skirts, robed priests and rabbis, or homosexual couples, as indeed has happened in Minneapolis?
And what to do should conductors, pilots, and stewards on trains and planes insist they should not transport unveiled women or serve alcohol. How far off is the day when emboldened imams in neighborhoods where American Muslims are in the majority, such Dearborn, Mich., demand the broadcasting of the calls to prayer over loudspeakers at dawn and at other times. Farfetched? Not at all. A few months ago, a naturalized Australian imam, Sheikh Taj Din al-Hilali, who came from Egypt, raised a storm when he likened unveiled Australian women to "uncovered meat that draws predators."
These are neither polemic nor frivolous questions given a cultural process that accepts that Islamic taxi drivers possess "religious rights" overriding public service codes and America's separation of church and state.Good thing they aren't refusing to bake cakes or serve pizza at weddings. They need a good dose of Uber.

Gov. Abbot (Texas) to the Rescue
Texas Gov. Greg Abbott calls for Convention of States to take back states’ rights
"Gov. Greg Abbott, aiming to spark a national conversation about states’ rights, said Friday that he wants Texas to lead the call for a convention to amend the U.S. Constitution and wrest power from a federal government “run amok.”
“If we are going to fight for, protect and hand on to the next generation, the freedom that [President] Reagan spoke of … then we have to take the lead to restore the rule of law in America,” Abbott said during a speech at the Texas Public Policy Foundation’s Policy Orientation that drew raucous applause from the conservative audience. He said he will ask lawmakers to pass a bill authorizing Texas to join other states calling for a Convention of States.
Along with the speech, Abbott released a nearly 70-page plan – part American civics lesson, part anti-Obama diatribe – detailing nine proposed constitutional amendments that he said would unravel the federal government’s decades-long power grab and restore authority over economic regulation and other matters to the states.
“The irony for our generation is that the threat to our Republic doesn’t come just from foreign enemies, it comes, in part, from our very own leaders,” Abbott said in a speech that took aim at President Obama, Congress and the judicial branch.
The proposal for a convention, which has been gaining traction among some among conservative Republicans, comes just as the GOP presidential candidates begin to make forays into Texas ahead of the March primary election. The state, with 155 delegates up for grabs, will certainly be a key player in the party’s nominating process.
Abbott hasn’t endorsed a candidate, though the field includes Sen. Ted Cruz, who was one of Abbott’s top employees when the governor was attorney general. Abbott is likely hoping to boost his national profile within the GOP as eyes turn to the state.
This week, presidential contender U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., published a piece in USA Today endorsing the idea of a convention to amend the Constitution and restore limited government. In April, 27 active petitions had been filed with Congress seeking a convention to amend the constitution to require that Congress adopt a balanced budget.
Congress would be forced to act once 34 states joined the effort. So far, Cruz hasn’t endorsed the idea."Here's the Plan:
Abbott, in his plan, dismisses many of those criticisms, saying that he would call for a limited scope to the convention.
The plan lays out nine specific proposed amendments that would:
Prohibit congress from regulating activity that occurs wholly within one state.
Require Congress to balance its budget.
Prohibit administrative agencies from creating federal law.
Prohibit administrative agencies from pre-empting state law.
Allow a two-thirds majority of the states to override a U.S. Supreme Court decision.
Require a seven-justice super-majority vote for U.S. Supreme Court decisions that invalidate a democratically enacted law
Restore the balance of power between the federal and state governments by limiting the former to the powers expressly delegated to it in the Constitution.
Give state officials the power to sue in federal court when federal officials overstep their bounds.
Allow a two-thirds majority of the states to override a federal law or regulation.
A convention, Abbott wrote, would force the federal government to “take the Constitution seriously again.”
“The only true downside comes from doing nothing and allowing the federal government to continue ignoring the very document that created it,” Abbott wrote.The Tenth Amendment should have been sufficient; it just needs an enforcement clause. Maybe the states need to march their National Guards on DC. However, overriding the Supreme Court with the voice of the people is also a necessity. When the Supreme Court is packed with one-world, fascist Leftists, there is no hope of constitutional stability in the nation.

THE… DOG:
I know many of us have wondered who was in charge of the Obama administration, but the dog seems rather a long shot.
Not impossible, mind, but unlikely.
And yet, he was the object of this plot. Man in alleged plot to kidnap Obama’s dog arrested on weapons charge.
