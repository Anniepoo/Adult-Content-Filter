WAVE
I walked a long way from the bonfire and stood still, letting waves lap over my feet. On nights like this, everything glows in the mist—the moonlight above, the crackling flames behind me. Some foreigners will spot moments like this as home: moments when time and place pass over each other, much like an eroding shore line. Silently past the dunes, you came up behind me and cupped your palm over my mouth. Your scent identified you immediately and you can’t imagine the relief I felt, as you leaned my head back into your torso, holding my wrists with your other hand. I didn’t think you’d remember this fantasy from months ago. But here you are, showing off your memory skills. Thin wrists in your sturdy grip. Inevitably bound to each other, we remain silent for a few minutes, before I push against your strength, testing your willingness to keep restraint alive. Your whole body contracts, steadying me to you. When I finally rest, you lower me down, knees into the cold sand. Sinking along with me, your inner thighs press against my arms, thrusting my rib cage onto the  sea. Pressing into my mouth, you turn my head to the side and begin savouring my neck, with bites, pulls, teeth and tongue. As quietly as I can, I moan into your palm, viscous syllables pouring through your fingers. The salt air is chill, your hands are hot and I’m exceptionally turned on in the sudden shelter you’ve created for me. The wave I’m riding is you.

MORE THAN A BODY
Had you in my head all day, murmuring to me between thoughts designed to escape you—how futile. You pick me up at work. By the time I spot your car along the avenue, you step out to open the door for me. No affection or fanfare, just the mechanics of basic habit. Although I pretend not to notice, I’m completely turned on by that assertive gesture. Take me like that, with such certainty about what you’re greedy for.
Later, warm against your chest, my worries seem distant and conquerable. You, your hand on my lower back, my hips taught against your pelvis. You, holding in your palm the curls around my ears. “I love your lips,” you said. I didn’t expect that and smiled, my mouth broadening. For a few moments, our smiles brim with laughter, a release. “Give them to me…” Pulling my neck to you, my mouth arches back up to yours again, wet without boundary, tireless.
I know I’ve done you right when your throat is as dry as your cunt is wet. Curl your lip again and I’ll lunge at your mouth, keeping you suspended, within the elixir of your own sweat, fogging up the car window…And then you take me home, game on: cuff me, lick and pull, bite me everywhere. Not the weak nibbling of indecision, no. I want you to show up for me. “Did you really like kissing me that first night?”“Yes. And every other time since.” You held me and kissed me more.
When you gather yourself for the giving and come to me, I’m yours. Then and there, as you wish. It takes more than a body to be yours. It takes the will to risk flesh. The will to be present for the unknown…it disarms me. When you come to me prepared for the taking, it resets me into humility.

Gorge
Splayed out on the bed, the weight of you feels so good on me. My legs wrap around the back your knees, your fingers twist my hair. Five minutes ago, your voice soared above my head. The sound of you in complete abandonment of logic, that sensation your voice leaves on my skin…it’s what I breathe for. Still beaming, settling into the warmth between us, I lay here with you, finger tips lingering down your spine.
We hold each other, no longer panting, easing into regular breath. I turn my head to you and kiss you, eyes gorging wide on you. Lowering your lids, you smirk as you bite my lip. “Thought you might have broken your clit on my teeth, little minx.” An uncontained smile expands on your face. “Are you alright?” I want to laugh, but can’t. I’m still so attracted to you, and the memory of what happened an hour ago, it hollows my chest with want. I lick your jaw slowly, curling my tongue around your chin and up to your lower lip…why haven’t you bored me yet? I haven’t fucked anyone else for as long as we’ve been fucking. “Quite alright, yes. You?”
“Couldn’t be better.” Face like yours. Jaw like that. I could get used to you. Your hands roam from breast to hip, pulling me to you with a demanding grip. As you press closer to me, the metal ring on your harness leaves a cool half-moon on my thigh. Soon, you’ll saunter home into the dawn, leaving your scent on my bed and my cheeks pink. All four of them. Demand more of me again, yes. I will reward you with something to gorge on.

FINGERSMACK
I tried sliding my fingers out. More than once. Humbled, I looked up to meet your eyes. That moment kept us closer to each other than to our own skin. I watched your pupils sink into an apologetic daze. But no apology was needed, it was hot. You, lying there, in full pleasure, devouring me, contracting. Acquiescence has its special allure: I plunge further and feel your juices celebrate this reach. This longing for your body to align its desires through my touch. With the phantom feeling of you around my fore and middle finger, I hold my pen and let the ink stain the page with words that can barely approximate that space we make. With our bodies, in our heads, on the bed.
I, who often hurt without telling, grasp my pen to record the details I could never forgive my mind for blurring. All the subtle things, I wrap them in letters. Holding you close to me with vowels and that echo of your voice, between four walls and a sweaty window pane.
