Growing a penis at 12: the ‚ÄòGuevedoce‚Äô boys of the Dominican Republic
houseofalexzander:
By Dr Michael Mosely
I hated going through puberty; voice cracking, swinging moods, older brother laughing at me. But compared to Johnny, who lives in a small town in the Dominican Republic, I had it easy.
We came across Johnny when we were filming for a new BBC2 series, ‚ÄúCountdown to Life‚Äù, which looks at the consequences of normal, and abnormal, developments in the womb.
Johnny is known as a ‚ÄúGuevedoce‚Äù, which literally means, ‚Äúpenis at twelve‚Äù. And the reason he‚Äôs called that is because, like 1 in 90 of the boys in the area, he first started to grow a penis when he was going through puberty.
Guevedoces are also sometimes called ‚Äúmachihembras‚Äù meaning ‚Äúfirst a woman, then a man‚Äù. When they‚Äôre born they look like girls with no testes and what appears to be a vagina. It is only when they near puberty that the penis grows and testicles descend.
Johnny, who is now in his 20s, was once known as Felicita. He was brought up as a girl and remembers going to school in a little red dress.
When he was young he would happily play with other little girls, but after the age of seven he started to change
‚ÄúI did not feel good, I no longer liked to wear a skirt, and I was no longer drawn to play with girls. All I wanted to do is play with toy guns and boys‚Äù
When he turned obviously male he was teased at school because‚Äù, as he put it, ‚Äúit is hard to imagine a girl that is now is a boy‚Äù.
^^Johnny
One of the first people to study this unusual condition was Dr Julianne Imperato, a Cornell endocrinologist. She travelled to this remote part of the Dominican Republic in the 1970s because of strange rumours about girls turning into boys
She eventually unraveled the mystery of what is going on and by doing so helped make a surprising medical breakthrough.
At conception we all inherit a set of genes from our parents that will, in time instruct our bodies to make us male or female. But for the first few weeks of our lives human embryos are neither. Instead we have a protrusion called a tubercle. If you‚Äôre genetically male the Y chromosome instructs the gonads to become testicles. They also send testosterone to the tubercle, where it is converted into a potent hormone called dihydro-testosterone This transforms the tubercle into a penis. If you‚Äôre female and don‚Äôt make dihydro-testosterone then your tubercle becomes a clitoris.
When Dr Imperato investigated the Guavadoces she discovered the reason they don‚Äôt have male genitalia at birth is because they are deficient in an enzyme called 5-Œ±-reductase, which normally converts testosterone into dihydro-testosterone. So they appear female when they are born, but around puberty, when they get another surge of testosterone, they sprout muscles, testes and a penis.
Apart from being slightly undersized everything works and the Guavadoces normally live out their lives as men, albeit with wispy beards and small prostates.
By a quirk of chance Dr Imperato‚Äôs research was picked up by the American pharmaceutical giant, Merck. They used her discovery to create a drug called finasteride, which blocks the action of 5-Œ±-reductase. IT is now widely used to treat benign enlargement of the prostate and male pattern baldness. For which, I‚Äôm sure, many men are truly grateful
Since he‚Äôs become male Johnny has had a number of short term girlfriends, but he is still looking for the love of his life. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to get married and have children, a partner who will stand by me through good and bad‚Äù, he sighs wistfully.

Came across this story today and found it compelling for many reasons. Particularly the fact that although teased occasionally by peers, the people of this village have no problem embracing, accepting and continuing to love individuals like Johnny. That‚Äôs inspiring to me!

lucycadence:
I am getting really sick of all the ‚Äòsissy‚Äô blogs that follow me and reblog my photos. I don‚Äôt have any problem with people having their own kinks, sharing photos about it or what ever but please remember, I AM NOT A SISSY OR A CROSSDRESSER. I am a woman. My identity is not a kink or a fetish, it‚Äôs who I am and I would very much like it if more people respected that. I don‚Äôt want my face on your sissy dreams blog or what ever it is.
Thank you.
Let me start off by saying, I‚Äôm sorry if I offend any trans women on here that I follow or reblog from.
I‚Äôm in a weird place in my life and for me while it may have started out as a bit of curiosity with a fetish, it has grown to be so much more of a confusing grey mess in my head.
What I have learned (I think) is that for me the feminine and female form are things that I admire, want to take some part in (even if just cross dressing), and form a relationship with. I‚Äôm attracted to women as well as other crossdressers, and trans women. I see trans women as women and think they are both equally attractive.
If I reblog a trans woman on my page, it‚Äôs because I think she‚Äôs beautiful and attractive in the same way any woman would be, or because I aspire to look just as good as her.
Anyways, sorry if I offended you in any way
