A few of my favorite records.
Several of the songs remind me of fabulous times with some wonderful people. What are your favorite and is there a special reason why?
I like this song “Of Nature” by the Faunts which has a really soft and almost haunting sound. It’s perfect in an early morning.
Another is “Crash Into Me” by Dave Matthews Band. It makes me think of someone that I used to adore in my high school days.
A third is one you have pictured here, which is “A Hard Day’s Night” by The Beatles.
Blues Brothers soundtrack on vinyl! So much win!!!Tough choices, I was always a fan of my dad’s record collection growing up. Loved listening to his collection of CCR (Cosmo’s Factory is a particular favourite!). Also, Steppenwolf. Earschplittenloudenboomer was a brilliant test of the stereo / windows! My first album was of an Aussie singer, Paul Kelly, with his song “All the Dumb Things”, fitting in hindsight! John Coletrane’s Blue Train was another I almost wore out. So many good memories with vinyl!(via sexysassymommy)
