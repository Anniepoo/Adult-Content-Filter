spiritualinspiration:
Are you believing that God will do something specific in your life today? Oftentimes, when we are standing in faith, the storms of life will blow. Things will come against us that try to knock our faith down. But, I to encourage you to stand strong in your faith and in your thinking so that you can be effective and see your dreams and desires come to pass.
Scripture tells us that if we go back and forth on what we believe, we are unstable and ineffective. Instead, we have to be fully persuaded that the Word of God is true no matter what we see. The way you stand firm in your faith is by staying focused on God instead of your circumstances. Sing praises to Him throughout the day and guard the words that come out of your mouth. When you stand firm in your faith, you have peace. You have a supernatural rest because you know God is in complete control. You trust Him completely. Today, stand firm in your faith, watch your words, and know that He is leading you into victory in every area of your life!(Source: typographicverses)

I spent most of her life chasing empty substitutes for Jesus. I tried to find my worth in things and people, only leaving me emptier. Spending much of my life entangled in sin, I experienced much brokenness from teen pregnancy, domestic violence, and infidelity. Today, I am committed to leading other broken women to wholeness through the Gospel and equipping them with the tools to walk with God for a lifetime.
{matthew 5:13-16}
