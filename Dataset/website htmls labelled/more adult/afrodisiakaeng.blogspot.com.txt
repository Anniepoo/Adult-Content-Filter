Fennel Arancini w/ Piquillo Pepper Coulis
Recipe
from: "Chef Gone Wild" Juicy Gossips.Recipes.Reviews.Experiments by Zen ChefIngredients:For the Coulis:2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil1 tablespoon chopped onion1 clove garlic, chopped6 piquillo peppers, seeds removed2 tablespoons unsalted chicken stock or low-sodium chicken broth1/2 teaspoon freshly squeezed lemon juiceMethod:Warm the oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook until tender, but not colored. Add the piquillo peppers and chicken stock and cook for an additional 2 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a blender, add the lemon juice and purée until smooth. Set aside.For the Risotto Balls:1 fennel bulb: leaves separated and bulb cut into 1/8-inch dice1 bunch flat-leaf parsley, leaves only7 cups unsalted vegetable stock or low-sodium vegetable broth8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter1 small onion, trimmed, and cut into 1/8-inch dice2 cups Arborio riceSalt and freshly ground pepper1/2 cup finely grated fresh Parmesan cheese1/4 pound fontina cheese, cut into small pieces1 tablespoon fennel seeds, toasted1 tablespoon pastis or anise liquor1 tablespoon mascarpone cheesePiquillo pepper coulis (from above)1/2 cup all-purpose flour2 large eggs, lightly beaten1 cup bread crumbsPeanut oil for deep fryingMethod:1. Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil. Add the fennel and blanch for 5 minutes. Add the parsley and cook 1 minute longer. Drain and hold under cold running water to cool. Squeeze the leaves to remove the excess moisture. In a blender, purée together the fennel and parsley leaves until bright green. Set aside.2. Bring the stock to a boil in a large saucepan. Reduce the heat to medium-low and keep the stock at a slow, steady simmer.3. Melt the butter in a Dutch oven or large pot over medium heat. Add the onion and fennel and cook, stirring, just until the onion is translucent but not colored, about 5 minutes. Add the rice, season with salt and pepper and cook, still stirring, for about 5 minutes longer. Add 1 cup of the hot stock. Cook, stirring often, until the rice absorbs most of the liquid. Add another cup of the hot stock and cook and stir as before. Continue cooking, stirring regularly and adding the stock 1 cup at a time, until 6 cups of stock have been added. At this point, taste the rice. Usually, the rice will need another 1/2 to 1 cup stock and a few more minutes to cook.4. Stir in the fennel-parsley purée, the cheeses, fennel seeds, and pastis. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Refrigerate until cold.5. With your hands, a spoon, or a small ice cream scoop, form balls 3/4- to 1-inch in diameter. Using your thumb, make a deep indentation in the center of each ball. Fill with 1/4 teaspoon piquillo pepper coulis, pinch the edges together to enclose the filling, and quickly roll between your palms to re-shape. Dip and coat each ball into the all-purpose flour, then into the eggs, and finally into the bread crumbs, making sure to coat them evenly and gently tapping off any excess. Place the balls on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet and freeze for at least 2 hours.6. Pour 3 to 4 inches of peanut oil into a deep pot and heat the oil until it reaches 325 degrees F on a deep-fat thermometer. Fry the balls in batches until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes for each batch. Using a slotted spoon, carefully lift the balls out of the oil and onto a paper towel-lined plate. Pat off any excess oil and season with salt. Serve immediately.nb. serves 50 amuse-boucheNO... not that fennel!

Walnut burgers
Ingredients:3 cups of walnuts, soaked for 2 hours1 cups of carrots, topped and tailed1/2 cup of fresh herbs, such as parsley, basil and coriander, tightly packed1/2 cups of red onion1 cups of portabello1/4 red pepper, deseeded and destalked3 sundried tomatoes, soaked for 2-6 hours1 cloves of garlic1/2 dessertspoon of paprika1/2 teaspoon of dried pizza herbs1/2 teaspoon of dried parsleyMethod:Set aside the fresh herbs, the pepper and half the onions. Finely chop the sundried tomatoes. Blend all other ingredients in a food processor. Transfer to a large bowl and continue blending with a hand blender until you achieve a smooth consistency.Very finely chop the remaining ingredients by hand (this ensures a good texture), and mix into the burger mix. Divide into 4 equal portions andform into burger shapes. You can eat it as it is, but we prefer to dehydrate for 4-24 hours for a much more intense flavour.Raw foodism is a lifestyle promoting the consumption of uncooked, unprocessed, and often organic foods, as a large percentage of the diet. It's supposed that raw food contain a lot of enzymes and bacteria and many more micro-organism that help human body.
Maybe aphrodisiacs elements will work better...
