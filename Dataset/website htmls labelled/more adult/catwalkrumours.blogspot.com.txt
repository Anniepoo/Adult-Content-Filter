Britney Spears Nude? How on Earth Is the Answer No?
Britney Spears Steps out in an Ultra-Low-Cut Dress on Her Birthday. Unfortunately, Nothing Pops out of Her Top.
Yesterday everyone's favorite troubled pop star, Miss Britney Jean Spears, celebrated her 27th birthday. She's so young! So busty! And her dress is so skimpy! But the pics of Brit's big celebration at The Daily Mail, while wonderfully sexy, especially considering Britney's lows of the past years, only disappoint. That's one hell of a lot of boob hanging out of that bustier. So why are we complaining? Where, oh, where have Britney's nipples gone? You could fit the tits of Keira Knightley, Sienna Miller, and Selma Blair into the flesh that's sticking out of Britney's dress, yet all we see is a questionable shadow of areola? Since yesterday also marked the release of Brit's new record, Circus, Mr Skin thinks she should have celebrated by showing off her big top!

Nude Kate Beckinsale Embarassed at Bare-Assed Mom
Nude Kate Beckinsale Embarassed at Bare-Assed Mom
Actress Admits to First Encountering the Primal Scene on the TV Screen
British babe Kate Beckinsale recalls the mortification she felt as a 10-year-old child when her mother, television star Judy Loe got naked on TV and gave the entire 60 million strong population of the United Kingdom a look at her naughty bits.
"The mortification of going to school! People said, 'I've seen your mother naked.' I literally had to beat up nine of them," recounts Kate.
Now that Kate's own daughter Lily Mo is nearing the age when Kate saw her mom naked on television, the actress is foreswearing on-screen nudity.
Luckily for Beckinsale-admirer Kevin Sorbo and others like him, Kate has already got some pretty good skin scenes in the can (so to speak).
In 1994, Kate looked great baring T&A in the thriller Uncovered, but her 1995 full-frontal nudity in Haunted need cause little Lily no discomfort, because those boobs, butt and bush belong to a body double.
In 1895, Freud wrote to his colleague Wilhelm Fliess about the trauma experienced by children when they first become aware of the adult sexuality of their parents. If a child sees her parents in the act of coitus too early, she can experience neurotic symptoms later in life.
If seeing her mother naked on TV as a child has caused Kate Beckinsale to abstain from skin for the rest of her life, we can hold out little hope for Deep Throat star Carol Connors's daughter Thora Birch going any farther than her brief boob-baring in American Beauty.

Megan Fox - The future Sex Symbol - Images, Movies, Biography & Rumors
For weeks the statisticians were baffled â€" this was completely unprecedented. How could one woman, totally unplaced in last yearâ€™s 100 Sexiest, be getting so many votes? And on the basis of just one movie? It seemed inexplicable. Until we re-examined two things. First, just how few hot women statisticians get to meet. And second, the Transformers DVD. Simply put: thereâ€™s not a woman alive who looks better bent over a 1976 Chevrolet Camaro in a denim miniskirt. Born in Tennessee, the former lingerie model appears to have been designed by a committee of licentious boffins. With a sultry glower, capricious pout and six tattoos, sheâ€™s the junior Angelina Jolie (but without the orphan addiction). With a body honed by surfing, and a love of weed, sheâ€™s also the new, improved Cameron Diaz. By her own admission, she has â€œthe libido of a 15-year-old boyâ€. And even her surname, Foxx, was stripper-esque until she dropped the last â€˜xâ€™. Thus, in hindsight, it was inevitable, with a clear 3,300-vote margin, the â€˜Most Googled Woman Of 2007â€™ became the â€˜The Sexiest Woman In The World 2008â€™. And the best is yet to come. Barely 22 years old, sheâ€™ll atone for her dearth of appearances post-Transformers by appearing opposite Simon Pegg in How To Lose Friends & Alienate People. Then she pops up in Oscar-winning stripper Diablo Codyâ€™s new film, Jenniferâ€™s Body, as a possessed cheerleader. In short: Megan Fox is the future of sex. But most intriguing of all? Youâ€™re looking at, officially, FHMâ€™s hottest subscriber. â€œI thought I was the coolest kid in school because I told everyone the jokes in FHM,â€ she smiles. â€œI love FHM and, as a subscriber, Iâ€™m so excited to be a part of it.â€ Gentlemen, meet your new queen. You have chosenâ€¦ wisely.Click here for her nude pics
