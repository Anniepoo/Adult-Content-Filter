Preemptive Spanking before a Social Event
We had a social event this past weekend and about an hour before we left, J told me he was going to spank me to make sure I didn't speak to anyone with that tone that he hates.
I have been getting spanked every day for the last week, so my ass was already very sore.
J said it would just be a quick reminder, and would happen immediately before we left.
I choose to wear a long skirt and a nice blouse.
About 5 minutes before we walked out the door, J told me to bend over the arm of the couch.  He pulled my skirt up and pulled down my underwear.  He told me to step out of them and that I wouldn't be needed them for the evening.
My skin prickled when I heard the buckle of his belt being undone.  Next was the familiar sound of it sliding out of all the belt loops.  He doubled it and spanked me with it 4 times (twice on each cheek).  It was very hard and I was instantly near tears.
He stood me up to face him and asked me if I was going to be pleasant to everyone and not use any cocky or sarcastic tone.  I agreed.
J was quick to remind me that if he heard any tone, saw any eye rolling, or anything of the like, he would discipline me right then and there.
I asked, "In front of everyone?"
He said, "No, of course not. We'll excuse ourselves and find some place private."
I told him that would not be necessary, I would be on my best behavior.
And I'm  happy to report that I did not earn any additional spankings this weekend.

BDSM practitioners 'healthier and less neurotic' than 'vanilla' peers?
Have you all been wondering where I've been?
For the past 6 months my cousins and I have been alternating taking care of one of our aunts.  I live in a different state, so I stayed with her for a month at a time.  The hardest part for me was being away from J for so long.  I should be able to stay home through the summer before I have to go back.
I've been home for a couple of weeks, and J has been hinting that he wants to get me back on a spanking schedule.  He says I seems stressed out and full of anxiety and he knows it helps me find calm when he takes charge of those things.
I think he's right.
While I was away, I read this article: "Whips, chains and full of life: BDSM practitioners 'healthier and less neurotic' than 'vanilla' peers".  You can read it here - http://www.nypost.com/p/news/international/whips_chains_neurotic_vanilla_peers_ebwiuRduLQ0AIznbiNZS9O
Do you agree with the article?

Wearing the Collar
This was a text between J and I today.
me: Do you have an outfit preference for tonight?
J: same as yesterday but with your collar.
me:  ok
J:  In fact, your collar should go on as soon as you wake up.
Well that's new.
This week has been full of new things for J and I. I've been meaning to blog about it, but have been so wrapped up in J.
He has been commanding and dominant and strict, and I have been making an effort to try to go with it and step out of my comfort zone from time to time. It's been fun and exciting and scary and uncomfortable all at the same time. I always go through many emotions when fantasy becomes reality.
I have been dressing (or undressing) for J and greeting him when he gets home from work.  The anticipation of him getting home and the process of getting ready to present myself to him in a way he will love, has been energizing.  I have been wearing a collar when in J's presence, but I guess tomorrow that will be changing to all day.  I have to find out what he will say about taking off the collar to go out.
I have worn the collar once, in public, so far.  It was on a trip to the grocery store, with J, and I had a scarf on.  I'm pretty sure no one saw it, but it was nerve wracking.  It was also kind of thrilling at the same time.  I have no idea how I would explain it if I ran into someone I knew and they saw it.

In Control
J has been so super horny the last few days, and he always acts more dominant and playful when he's like that. I think it's because he knows he doesn't have to travel as much in the next few weeks, and he's looking forward to the extra days at home.
We got to talk about all kinds of things this weekend and one of them was control. J says he really likes the control. I said I liked when he had control, too. I also told him how much I love pleasing and pleasuring him.
We got to play a lot this weekend - we were like 2 teenagers! We haven't really had much time together lately so we were both a little pent up.
But there were also a few times where J was serious. He told me he wanted to work more on everything, including my submission to him. I agreed.
He kept me well spanked all weekend. He would just randomly spank me throughout the day. We would just be watching a movie or making lunch or something and he would gently guide me over his knee and spank me for a few quick minutes. During each spanking, he asked me if I was sure I wanted him to be in charge.  I said "yes".  He asked if I would stop fighting him on things I didn't want to do.  I said "yes", but that one is going to be hard.
I know that normally if there's something I really don't want to do, J won't make me. He always gives in. But not this time. He said it's going to be different this time. (I do have a safe word, if it gets to be too much, though.)
An example is that he was telling me to do something and I was resisting.
He said, "If you pull away again, I'm going to paddle you."
I later asked him if he really would have paddled me. He said "Absolutely."
Now that is different for him. He normally would have said no.
He also told me to go do the dishes this morning, after breakfast. He has never said that before. He doesn't usually pay attention to my housekeeping skills (or lack thereof). I loved it.  I so much want to be a good housewife, always having all the chores done and always having a clean house.  The only reason I don't is because I get lazy. If J keeps on me to keep up with the dishes, vacuuming, dusting, etc... I'm much more likely to get them all done, and we'll both be happier.
I'm going to try really hard to just let go and go with it.  So far, it's been lots of fun.

How can we get back to our spanking schedule?
It's been about 7 months of J's new traveling schedule, and we can't seem to find a way to get back on OUR schedule.
As soon as we start again with consistent spanking, he has to leave for a week.
The disruption is unwelcome every time, and it messes up our "flow", for lack of a better word.
We have been able to play, but there just hasn't been time for the discipline side of our lives.
When he is home we're usually trying to catch up with house stuff, family stuff, friend stuff.
And just enjoying each other's company.
Does anyone else have this type of problem?
How do you overcome it?
How do you work discipline into your schedule?

Missing the Structure of Spanking
It's been so long since J and I have had any real spanking schedule or anything DD related, at all.
Things just keep getting in the way.The latest is J's job has him traveling more than normal. So far I've been able to go with him on several trips, but there's not a lot we can do in a hotel room that doesn't make noise.
I'm finding myself starting to miss the structure of having consequences.
I like the routine of reminder spankings.J has been wanting to spank me lately, but there has not been the opportunity.
I did get my pussy spanked briefly a few days ago.
J wanted a blow job before bed and I just wasn't in the mood. I said no, and J immediately flipped me over onto my back and hand-spanked my pussy.
He reminded me of our agreement and told me I was in desperate need of a spanking.
We could start back on a schedule this week, but J has a trip coming up that I am unable to go on, so I don't want to get started back into a routine just to have to take a 2-week break again so soon.
Sigh.

Did you think I fell off the face of the earth?
Nope!
I'm still here.
My injuries (foot/knee) are all healed! They have been for awhile, but then things got hectic with J's business, and then we were traveling over the holidays, then we had house guests....We haven't been on our spanking schedule in months. Mostly due to our busy schedule, guests, etc.
But also I just haven't been in the right mindset for it.
I can tell J is anxious to get back into things, but I think I take longer to decompress and ease our way back into it.A few times over the past weeks and months, J did spank me, but only for a few minutes at a time and never for any serious infraction.
Mostly just play.He has given me a bedtime again. I had been staying up way too late and then sleeping late and not getting enough done during the day.
So I once again have a set time to be in bed.
That just started again last week.
I hate having to watch the clock, though.I will try to blog more often, but for now I'll leave you with this picture...

Where has the time gone?
Hello everyone!I'm still here!
I haven't dropped off the face of the earth!It's been a long past couple of months.
As many of you know I broke my foot.
It made everything very difficult, including all spanking activities.
We tried a few times, but it never really worked.
Then, the last time, I twisted my knee!
That took a few weeks to heal and made things just that much harder.I'm all healed now, but I find myself still moving very cautiously.
J and I are both nervous about resuming my spanking schedule.
Mostly the problem arrises in my inability to not squirm. If I jolt my knee or foot I'm afraid it will hurt!I don't have much else to report.
We had a great summer, even with my injury.
I hope you all did, too.*cassady

Foot Update and a Spanking
My foot is mostly better, I've had lots of physical therapy and I can walk around a bit more now.
J and I still haven't really been able to get back into things; it's surprising how hard it is to get into certain positions with an injured foot.
It's like I'm missing a whole leg.
Not only can my foot not bear a lot of weight/pressure, but my whole leg is weaker from lack of use, so it's harder to support myself in different positions that I'm used to.
J did, however, find a way to spank me today.
He said he thought I really needed it (which I did).
We were laying on our bed and my legs were dangling over the edge, so there was no pressure on my foot or leg.
He spread open my legs and spanked my pussy.
It wasn't hard, but it stung.
I could not stay still either.
J said I was squirming much more than usual, which tells him I am too much out of practice.
He said he will need to remedy that.
I then stood in front of J and he bent me over slightly, so that I was pretty much standing, but putting most of my weight on my hands, leaning on the bed.
He grabbed a nearby wooden brush and paddled me with the flat side of it.
It wasn't very long, but it was a definite reminder that I shouldn't let myself become lazy or neglect my chores (at least the ones I'm able to do with a broken foot!)

Broke my Foot!
Just a quick update to let everyone know what has been going on here.
I apologize for not updating sooner. Last month I broke my foot.
ACK!It's healing nicely, but J and I haven't been able to do much playing or spanking or anything. I have a removable cast and crutches, so I've been able to get around a little, but mostly I have to keep it elevated and iced.I was depressed when it first happened. The loss of mobility was terrible.
And I haven't been spanked in nearly a month!Hopefully I'll be healed soon (they say 6-8 weeks) and we can get back to business! lol

Chore Charts & Cleaning Lists
I found this site that has Chore Charts, Cleaning Lists, and other household management tools that you can print for free.
http://moneysavingmom.com/downloads/household-management-formsI generally just make a to do list on a piece of scrap paper, but I like the organization of the forms on that site.
And it lets you easily customize them to your own needs.I showed them to J and he said they would be much easier to read than my "scribbles" that I write down on the scrap paper.
I'm going to print a few tonight and see if it helps make me more organized.I've had an easy week so far.
J gives me a lot of slack when it's that time of the month.
I've been keeping up with my chores, but J has crossed a few things off of my list when I haven't been feeling well, and I haven't been spanked at all.
Next week will be a different story...

Reminder Spankings
After getting reminder spankings every weekday for 2 weeks, J told me he thinks I am ready to go back to our old schedule of 3x a week.
My first reaction was relief to not be getting spanked every day.
But then I started to wonder if I might actually need daily spankings to keep on the path I'm on.
The past 2 weeks I feel like I've been mostly on top of things and am getting better at being submissive to J.
Maybe I need daily reminders .
It puts me in a certain headspace where I feel like I'm confident in my place and what I have to do.I'm beginning to realize I like the routine and accountability involved in our version of DD.
It makes me feel safe and secure to know that someone cares about what I do and will help me be a better person, even if those ways might be unconventional.
I like to know that I am going to get spanked on certain days and at certain times, even if I haven't done anything wrong.
I know some people think that it's unfair to be spanked for "no reason", but I don't see it that way at all.
I see it as J knowing enough about me to know what I need, and he follows through.
And I definitely need to be spanked regularly.
Otherwise I just fall to pieces.
Not emotionally - I'm always very happy with my life, but as far as getting things done - errands, chores, etc... I just get so lazy, I just don't do anything.
The reminder spankings really help keep me on track.I'm hoping 3 spankings a week will be enough for me to happily get my to-do lists done, and not struggle with finishing it each night.
And I hope the weekly pussy spanking is enough to help me be submissive to J without any complaints or hesitation.If anyone wants to post in the comments, or email me privately, I'd love to know what spanking schedule you have and if it's working.
