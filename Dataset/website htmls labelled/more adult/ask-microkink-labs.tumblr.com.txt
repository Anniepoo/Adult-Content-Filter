This one’s a redone render from a scene I made ages ago, but I never got around to uploading any images (as far as I can remember.) The redhead girl is absolutely, definitely 100% not supposed to be Christina Hendricks… (Please don’t sue me, Christina! And it would be great if you could return my calls…)I just realized I’ve never gotten around to making a proper comic with this model/character. I may have to change that, one of these days…Patreon members can download the original HD image here: https://www.patreon.com/posts/redhead-street-3206809

For some reason ‘Dude, Where’s My Car?’ had a giant alien woman for it’s final scene.
Best part of the whole movie.
