Q:What do you think of online matching/dating sights such as eharmony? The idea of meeting someone who is "compatible" with you seems cool. It seems like the fast track versus meeting people in coffee shops and spending 2 months figuring out if you have much in common. It also seems less romantic though.. That 2 months is also fun and thrilling sometimes. But life today is so fast track itself, fast track getting to know someone makes sense. Or doesn't it?

Currently in America, approximately one quarter of all marriages are people who met online.   Sometimes it’s a dating sight.  Sometimes it might be Facebook.   Could be Tumblr or Twitter or Tinder.    So clearly, it works.   What I think is pretty much exactly in line with what you wrote.   However, I think you’ve painted a false dichotomy.   You make it sound like either you spend time getting to know how much you have in common or you just learn that by an online profile.  That’s false.   Online profiles are only worth so much.    I can read all about you, but until we start communicating, Im not going to really know who you are.    Thus, that “fun and thrilling” time will come either way, if you’re open to it.

Are Good Relationships Really a 50/50 Thing?
amanwomenlove:
A relationship needs to be 50/50.
There has to be give and take in a relationship.
Strong relationships are about the ability to compromise.
Have you heard that before?  I’m sure you have.   It’s the typical way to view relationships.  I think it’s nonsense.
Why do I say that?  When you approach a relationship as a series of compromises, you will inevitable disagree at what the correct point of the compromise is.  YOU might think it’s 50/50.  But SHE thinks it’s 70/30, and she’s on the short end of that equation.
YOU think it’s reasonable for you to go out to the bar every Sunday night for football and pool, because SHE goes out every month with her girlfriends for a Ladies Night the sushi bar.  However, she thinks that since she goes out once a month without you, you should only be allowed to go out once a month without her.
YOU think it’s reasonable that since you pay most of the rent and take care of maintenance, she should do your laundry for you.  SHE thinks that it’s bullshit that she has to pick up you stanky-ass drawers off your closet floor.
And so on and so forth.
You don’t agree on a compromise… you don’t think it’s entirely fair… and so you are a bit bitter.  That makes the next compromise a bit more difficult.   Pretty soon, the relationship turns into a battleground.  Who is gaining and losing turf?   It’s going to end ugly.
I would like to propose to you that a better way than the 50/50 approach is something really dramatic.
100/0
When I approach a relationship, I have the mindset that my job is to give up everything, sacrifice everything, do everything for her.  I expect nothing from her.    Is that what I want to happen or believe is what will happen?  Of course not!  It’s a mindset.  In my mind, I expect I’m going to give and give and give and get nothing in return.   There are two reasons for doing this.
The first is that it helps me weather the bumps.  When my girlfriend does something or says something that isn’t what I would have liked, I don’t get all huffy.  “Fuck that!  I thought we were supposed to go at this 50/50!!!!  FIFTY-FIFTY!” (Curls into a fetal position and sucks thumb.)  If 1 means she does the absolute bare minimum for me, like holds my hand, and 100 is that she does everything for me and gives everything to me (including anal!) I wasn’t expecting 50.  I was expecting ZERO… nada… zip.   So I can calm my ass down if she does something that rates a 40ish on the scale of good-girlfriend behavior.
But the second and more important thing this mindset does is help me become transformative in our relationship.   It will change her for the better.   When you show that type of self-sacrificial spirit to someone, they are going to be overwhelmed by your kindness.   They will reciprocate.  That will change me for the better too.
Imagine a relationship where the other person ALWAYS was thinking of you, ALWAYS put your interests before their own, ALWAYS considered you first in every decision.  Would that not be as close to heaven on earth as you could find?  Would you not do EVERYTHING you could to make that person happy?  Of course you would!   That’s the power of the 100/0 mindset.  If you want to get all New Agey… it gets positive energy going.   The guy is doing everything he can for the girl.  That makes her want to do everything she can for the guy.  Which just makes him want to do more for her.  Which just makes her want to do more for him.   Transformative.
Some of you are thinking, “Daniel, if I’m that nice to my mate, doesn’t that just set me up to be walked all over… to be taken advantage of?”  That it does.  Which I guess is the third benefit of this 100/0 approach.  If someone takes advantage of you when you are THAT kind and loving, they clearly are lacking in character.  There’s something wrong with them!  You should break up and move on.  You have all the red lights you need.
So, next relationship you are in, give the 100/0 approach a try.  Get up and say, “Today, I give everything to my mate.  I expect nothing in return.”  See what happens.
5D!
That’s a Daniel Davis Double Dog Dare!
PS - I’m not the only one who feels this way.  You can order the book below HERE.  Good stuff.

Q:Curious lol, what is it about anal that makes you enjoy it so much? I don't enjoy anal too much I would MUCH rather only have vaginal sex but my boyfriend loves it. I've never told him that I don't really like it because I know he won't want to do it anymore despite how much he enjoys it and I want him to enjoy himself. So if he's happy I'm happy but I am curious to know from your opinion what do you enjoy about it so much?

I have a very long post about this somewhere in my archives.  Type “anal” in the search bar, and you should find it.  But it boils down to three things, I think in this order.  It’s naughty.  It’s always fun to have sex that feels visceral and taboo.It feels fantastic, different than vaginal sex.  Note I DID NOT SAY “BETTER.”  I said “different.”   Variety is the spice of life.It is sort of an act of submission, of a woman giving herself to you completely, which can be a turn on.

Q:Do you know of any erotica websites? I rely on lush stories and literotica (because their mobile websites are very easy to navigate) but I've read the majority of the stories and was hoping to read the work of new authors. Any links? Stories ?
Anonymous
Nope.  I don’t really read erotica, which is ironic, I know, because I enjoy writing it.   But I can’t help you.    If when you say “Stories?” you’re asking if there are any on AMWL…  Yes, there are.   Type “erotica” or “erotic stories” or “erotic story” or “naughty story” or just “story” in the search bar at the top of the page.   A bunch of things will come up.

Q:Hey sexy ;) I'm 21 (female) and lately cannot stop masturbating.
EVERYTHING turns me on and I find myself counting down the minutes until I can go home and play with myself.
Nothing has changed in my sex life, I have no idea why this is happening all the sudden.
I feel like I'm 14 again!! Do you have any advice? I already have an amazing vibe, and it makes me cum hard but I'm still soooo fucking horny ALL THE TIME!
Anonymous
There are three thoughts I have on this.First, honestly assess if this is a problem.   “Cannot stop masturbating” is obviously not literal.   So do you mean once a day?  Do you mean three times a day.   Lots of people - men and women - masturbate every day.    They’re horny.   But that isn’t out of control.Secondly, if it is that you’re out of control, masturbating multiple times a day, you need to gain self-control.   That typically requires external pressure. You need someone/something to hold you accountable.    Granted, that’s awkward when it comes to something like masturbation.    But you can’t just say to yourself, “Be more self controlled.”  You need to learn self control, which is like learning to ride a bike.  You need training wheels.  That tends to be an accountability partner, like a sponsor in AA.  Thirdly, you need to wrestle honestly with your feelings to determine if this is horniness or if it’s coping, which means it’s more of an addiction.    It might be that you have used masturbation/orgasms to deal with stress.   And indeed, it’s a great way to deal with stress.   But so is a nice drink.   I have a long day, and I love two fingers of good scotch over two cubes.   But if I need the liquor to cope with stress, then what was healthy - a relaxing drink - has become an unhealthy, controlling addiction.    I need to learn to cope with stress another way.    So ask yourself if you’re really horny… OR… if you just use masturbation to cope with life.   If it’s the second one, you’ve turned sexual pleasure into something that is hurting you.    Find another way to cope, and keep sexual pleasure as part of the frosting of life.Good luck.Daniel

So Selena Gomez and her friends…
I’m not sure what is going on, cause I don’t pay attention to pop culture details.  I pay attention to tits and ass.  So if there’s a pic of some cute celeb showing off tits and ass, I’ll notice said tits and ass.  I won’t read what the context was surrounding the tits and ass.So I’m not sure why, but Selena Gomez has been instagramming pictures of her and four friends, all of them in bikinis.I think there’s only one logical explanation.  I think Selena Gomez is essentially trying to challenge me.  “Daniel, do you think you can satisfy five women in one night?”And the answer is, “Of course.”   I have ten fingers, a tongue, and a magnificent dong.   Even my toes are pretty fucking dextrous.   So I’m certain I could find a way to keep five women occupied at once.  As far as leaving them all satisfied in one night…   Sheeeeet kidssssssss…  I just need to hydrate!   I’ll be just fine.  I’m long.  I’m strong.  And I’m down to get some friction on.So, Selena, let’s stop playing.  You text me the deets on location, and I’ll find a way to fill 15 holes by sunrise.   I’m Daniel Davis. It’s what I do.

Q:Hi Daniel, you just did a whole thing on how to suck men without much mouth effort. Do you think you could do one on eating out women and how to get better results easier? Especially if he doesn't have a long tongue and it gets tired easily. Thanks.
purplelovehandles
If you type “cunnilingus” into my search bar, you’ll find a lot of posts about how to go down on a woman.    As far as tongue length, that doesn’t make a difference.   To give a woman good head, it is entirely unnecessary to get the tongue inside her.    You are using the tongue primarily to stimulate the clitoris and the labia.    As far as his tongue getting tired, he simply needs to do it more!  The tongue is a muscle.  The more it’s put to a task, the easier that task becomes.Good luck!Daniel
