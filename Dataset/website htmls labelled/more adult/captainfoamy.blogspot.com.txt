Gene Wilder Gets Urinary Track Disorder...Continues to Pee with No Remorse.
You would think an average human would try his hardest to stay away from the pain and agony of peeing through an infected inner penis but Gene Wilder doesn't mind a little puss shooting out of his dick and no amount of pain is gonna stop him from peeing on your mom's new Algonquin throw rug!"I'm peeing and shitting and I have no excuse!"

Sorry the Earth’s best site is on hiatus...
Captain Foamy, your favorite indy comedy hero, spent all his money mailing envelopes filled with pee to Martin Short.So the site didn't have enough money to pay it's bill to the Yahoo Gestapo.It's a sad day in Foamy land friends...but keep your heads up, have a drink or 10, stink your fingers in somethings butt, whatever it takes.Just don't give into the sadness or you might get sucked into the cold swampy Earth like Atreu's horse on the Never Ending Story.We will see what happens for Foamy.Just keep the memory alive!!!

Correction...
After consulting a dictionary it turns out D-A-S-P-A isn’t a word.
Bush lost his double word score and his pride.
Now back to Frasier already in progress.
