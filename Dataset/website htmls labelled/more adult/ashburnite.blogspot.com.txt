I am Penn State
Wednesday, November 09, 2011
Obviously, I haven’t been blogging in a while.  Life happens.
And honestly, there hasn’t been anything that I have felt was important
enough to write about recently.  Until
now.  I’ve debated saying anything about
the subject, knowing there are so many people out there who are quick to place
blame and judge.   But there are so many
people out there saying such disparaging things about the school I love that I
can no longer keep quiet.
What
Jerry Sandusky did was disgusting and reprehensible.  And anyone who knowingly covered it up is
equally horrible.  However, I honestly do
not believe that everyone involved was out to “keep it quiet.”  I’ve read the indictment.  All 23 pages.
If you have time, you should do so as well (just don’t do it before
lunch).
But the point of this post is not to analyze
who-knew-what-and-told-whom.  That will
all come out in the days to come.  The
thing that drove me to this post is plain and simple.  I had a moment this morning where I considered
taking the Penn State magnets off my car.
I felt ashamed of my school…that something this heinous could happen at
a place that I considered home.  There
has never been a moment in the eleven  years since I left State College where I felt
anything but pride at being a Penn Stater.
It’s not just a college.  It’s
part of who I am.  After all, those of us
that went there “bleed blue and white,” as the saying goes.  I have a (small) Penn State flag at the
office.  I worried that people would walk
by and see that flag and associate me with the disgusting, horrible acts
committed by Sandusky.  And it breaks my
heart that my beloved school is now being associated that pervert.
But Sandusky is not Penn State.  He is a disgusting individual who used his
power to prey on children.  He is not the
hundreds of thousands of PSU alum.  He
does not represent the approximately 45,000 students there.   There
is a sense of pride at home games that is indescribable.  The students of Penn State have done so much
good in the world.  THON (the annual Penn
State Dance Marathon) raised almost $10,000,000 last year alone for "The Four
Diamonds Fund, a charity devoted to defeating pediatric cancer through research
and caring for patients at the Penn State Hershey Medical Center Children's
Hospital"(thank you, Wikipedia).  And, having participated in
THON, I can tell you, the sense of pride at that event is as overwhelming as
the sense of pride on a Saturday in Beaver Stadium.
So I will not be ashamed that I’m a Penn Stater.  Yes, I am broken-hearted and hurt.  Yes, it saddens me that people are losing sight of the victims.  The actions of one horrible excuse for a
human being do not reflect on my school.
Whatever details come out in the days ahead about
who-knew-what-and-told-whom, it cannot detract from the pride of having been a
part of such an amazing school.
Most importantly, more than ever, we need to hold our heads
up high and say “I am Penn State.”
