Theron lends voice to Flux Majesco game: "Oscar winner Charlize Theron is the latest actress to go virtual.
In addition to starring as sexy agent Aeon Flux in the Paramount Pictures film coming to theaters this fall, it was confirmed recently that she will provide the voice and likeness for Majesco's Aeon Flux video game.
The game, which serves as a prequel to the film, will tie together Aeon Flux creator Peter Chung's animated TV series, which aired on MTV from 1992-97, and the live-action movie directed by Karyn Kusama.
"By including the voice talent and likeness of Charlize Theron, we hope to provide consumers with a product that seamlessly fits within the world of 'Aeon Flux' yet offers an interactive component that complements its entertainment counterparts," Majesco president Jesse Sutton said.
The game will introduce new action elements, including speed stealth attacks and the ability to slow time through "flux," which will enhance the player's arsenal of high-tech weapons and gadgets."
