Bugger all happens here at Waly Waters
G'day.Yes, it's been a while, but bugger all happens here at Waly Waters.Anyway, Spud's got a new girlfriend. And she's not decrepit, like the other ones he picks up at the pub. This girl has a brain! And she paints! Not rooms. This one paints pictures. Proper pictures.Here's one of hers.Good 'un, eh?

Strewth!
G'day.
Its not so hot here today.
In fact, there was a bit of a chill in the air when I pointed percy to the dust, first thing.But, hey - have we got problems.
Spud's in love with the sheila on the Dildo Song video.
We told him - hey Spud - she's got a friend already - don't you know what a dildo is?
And you know what he said?
He said "Yez, natch man.
They had them in New Zealand a while back, but someone shot the last one, and now they're extinct."See - Spud's not exactly what you'd call a mental giant.Anyway, Rick found this video of Alice, which is not too far away from Daly Waters.
Except that is it real?
Strewth!
There are three corners!!!
Picken reckons its an optical illusion.Picken should know.
He went to Melbourne once.Have a good 'un!Your mate, Carsley.

The dildo song
G'day.Yes, and its another hot one here at Waly Waters.Something has been troubling us for weeks here.
Its the song that Spud's been singing to himself all the time.Rick finally found out what it was, and now that's even more worrying.
Its the dildo song.

Glenda
G'day.
What with the weather gone weird here, Rick reckons that Glenda may even reach Waly Waters.
He's going to batten down the dunny, just in case.

A big 'un
G'day.Spud dropped this one, which was too big for the dunny.
I told him not to eat so many burgers.

Tosser
