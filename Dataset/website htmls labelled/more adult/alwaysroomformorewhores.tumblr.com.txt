Demented Imaginings
Hello. 35-year-old east coast Canadian lad ( Prince Edward Island, a cookie if you've ever heard of it. Possibly quite more if you're a sub girl who lives here ;) ). This is primarily a very nasty porn blog, with the occasional cute animals or silly or political things strewn throughout. I am also a nerdy fanboy. Learn to cope, and consider yourself warned. All asks and fanmail and messages and submissions and the likes are welcome. I'm new to Tumblr and mostly just here for the pretty, pretty, dirty ladies. ;)
Also, I'm not a misogynist, I just play one on television. :P Seriously though, I like rough, degrading, humiliating, and painful kink sometimes, but, and I cannot stress this enough, ONLY IF THE GIRL LIKES IT. I do not enjoy hurting or abusing people who do not want it, but that is what some people crave ( in a perfectly normal way, you don't have to be damaged goods or have daddy issues to enjoy that kind of stuff ). If you think there is no such thing as consensual or healthy misogyny play, you can just leave. I consider myself a feminist. Anybody has the right to make any choice that doesn't hurt anybody else who doesn't ask for it. This includes the right to be controlled, abused, or anything else that feminists usually fight against. Rape = bad. Consensual rape play however is perfectly healthy and very common. I love women, and like to give those people I care about what they need, and sometimes what they need looks really bad to an outside observer. Check your judgement at the door, this is an "everybody is safe" area. Besides, there is a thing known as aftercare, and it is wonderful. ;)
Also, I may be pretty straight ( I usually say heteroflexible ), but I am very, very much a GLBTQIA ally ( hell, because of my sexual proclivities and general gender oddness, I actually identify as "queer", but that pisses off so many in the community who think I'm appropriating their hard-won word, when frankly I think it helps normalize it. Besides, if, for example, you are a cute girl with a penis, I will probably be into you, hence my claim that although I may be into girls pretty exclusively, I'm definitely queer ). Anyways, lesbians and feminists and everybody else, please don't go hating me because you think I'm a woman/queer/anybody-hating asshole. People are in general awesome, and we are strengthened by diversity. I love you all. :)
Oh yeah, and my Kik is Basilikon. Message away. ;)
Ask me things!
