Squish's Birth Story
The Journey:
The
past year and a half we went from never in a million years EVER
believing we'd have a child together, to getting the super surprise and
shock of being pregnant, to actually getting excited about a baby, only
to have our new dreams all blown away by a miscarriage.  At this point
there was no going back for me, I had already turned into the crazy
lady and decided we were going to keep going and try again - on purpose.  So we tried again, only
to suffer another loss.  One more try, only this time I had more
knowledge of progesterone and baby aspirin.  If I had anything to do
with it, the third time was going to be the charm.  I fought for my
progesterone, I fought for the baby aspririn and wound up fighting for
several more things.  We got through that and then found out we had a 5%
chance of Down Syndrome and 27% chance of Trisomy 13 and 18, he beat
those odds on the amnio, and then the chance of heart disease was very high and he
came through with baby EKG showing that he was 100% healthy.  Then I found out I passed the
gestational diabetes test but was Anemic so I went on iron pills and stool
softeners.  Then came SPD which is when your pelvic pain/pressure from
the pelvis starting to spread early on.  Ouch.  But what's a little pelvis pain
without severe adema?  My ankles feet and toes got the worst of the swelling.  Then I noticed my
hands and feet itched a little but didn't think anything of it...
entering the 3rd trimester I started having itching on my chest.  Then
my neck started itching with it - then it went to my cheeks.  I wanted
to scratch my chest and face off.  Luckily one of my fellow birth month buddies
told me about her itching with ICP or what they call Pregnancy
Cholestasis.  It's when your liver makes too much bile and that causes the
itching.  Nothing helps it except being on the meds for it and even
then sometimes it doesn't help.  I asked my doc to be tested, the
results took a week and during that time my itching got worse - I had to
fight again and begged for her to let me TRY the meds for 10 days, if
it helped we would know I have it.  She agreed, it helped and that following Monday
my bile results came back and indeed I was positive for ICP.  This is
fatal to the baby so I had to go for weekly Non-Stress tests to watch him and my fetal specialists required me to get bi-weekly sonograms to
keep watch on him, and induction was set for 37 weeks.
Grayden's Birth Story:
When
I went in the night before induction for my cervix gel we found out
that Squish had turned breech, so my induction was changed to a
c-section first thing in the morning.  The nurse told me different
things to try, when I started to feel him move and it hurt a little I
start pushing him in a circular motion.  It hurt like it felt like it
worked but still kinda felt like he wasn't down... we got the hospital
at 6am, I asked them to check the sono just in case - they prepped me
for c-section while waiting on the doctor.  Doctor Eng came in and
checked me via sono and low and behold that little stinker turned head
down!!  So we changed the plan from a c-section BACK to induction and started the Pitosin drip.  Had a few
contractions, not a lot, so they checked me and I was dilated to 4, so
they broke my water.  Little more contracting, not a ton of pain yet, they came in and put the internal fetal monitor on Squish, which turned out to be extremely important.
Another 30-45 min and the Doc shows up - says they need me to turn on
my side - that Squish's heartbeat was dropping.  I turned on my left
side, it came up for a second then started to go down again, they had me
roll on my right side - same thing.  My Mom, Dad and T's Mom came in
the room right at that point and before I know it Dr. Eng told me the baby's heartbeat kept
dropping and we needed to go ahead and do a c-section before it gets to the
point where it's really bad.  His heartbeat was 90 - then 80.  The next
second it dropped to 50 (I didn't know this until the next day) - my
family was rushed out of the room - Dr. Eng got my attention and looked directly at me and said we
need to go NOW and the look on his face told me all I needed to know and I said ok and we were off!   They were
already rolling me out - T kissed me and said he loved me as we were moving and told me it
would be ok and the next second I was in the operating room - moving
over to the operating table.  My first thought was they better have a
good way to keep my fatass on that skinny table!  ;-)  Meanwhile there was
like a code blue going on for Squish - Mom said 20 people came running
down the hall and that's when they started freaking out - the ER was a
big commotion of screams and shouts of everything going on around me
medically - the nurse told me everything that was happening which REALLY
helped calm me (if that was possible!), I was freezing and fighting
tears because I was so worried about Squish, I also felt like I was hyperventilating the adrenalyn was kicking in big time.  The anesthesiologist put
an oxygen mask on my face and I'm crying and fighting it trying so hard not to, he's
telling me it's just oxygen and this whole time all I could think was JUST KNOCK ME OUT ALREADY!  I already knew I was going to wake up crying and I just wanted
to be out and not so scared.  They strapped my legs down, they strapped
my arms down, my body was shaking from adrenalin, being so scared, and
the OR was soooo cold.  All of this happened in a matter of about 2
minutes I would guess but felt like forever.  The next thing I know I was waking up - I
started crying and asked what happened and where Titus was so he could
tell me the baby was ok.  He was with Grayden and I asked the nurse if
Grayden was ok - they said he was and then Kevin and Jessica came in
someone directed them to the wrong room and I was crying saying I'm ok
it's the hormones worried that he would think something was wrong - the
nurses scooted them out and then Titus came in and I started crying more
and I asked him if Squish was ok and he said yes he's ok and I could
only cry as he tried to comfort me.  He told me he was so cute and
perfect.  Grayden was in the Labor and Delivery room I had started off
in that morning - he was with the family.
Titus went and got him and
brought him to me and I just barely remember meeting him for the first
time (see picture).  Evidently he cried and cried until he was
given to me lol  I remember telling Titus to take care of him, that I
would be ok just make sure he is ok.  The rest was a blur for a bit -
He sent my Mom in and I remember her telling me how Grayden was ok and
he was perfect and she wouldn't let anyone hold him until I got to hold
him first.  Gotta love your Mom!  I remember having to stay in recovery,
then being wheeled to our room.  We've been through so much and after
all of this he is here, he is 100% healthy, he is adorable, and he is
our little miracle who was meant to be, and that's his story.

WOW!
I just came across this old blog of mine...  and GEEEEZ so much has happened these past few years!  Just in the last year even... so here's the run down...
My brother passed away ... it made me want to be close to family.  So I decided to move from Texas back towards home in Maryland.  Things were going nowhere with T and I and it was just time to make a change.  It took a year to find a job, then it came up quick.  T stayed and I left having only 3 weeks to pack up and get to Virgina.  I got the necessities, packed up the van and the kids, left the necessities to go back and move it into a pod later, then off we went.  2 months later I went back to pack the house into a POD and T helped me - somewhere in the middle of all that mess both of us had an epiphany, it shocked me to my core because I thought I was done and moving on.  My heart had other plans and didn't seem to want to let go.  I flew back and we continued talking and on New Year's Eve we decided we were going to give it one last try...  In February T and his son made the drive to Virginia and moved with us...  Since then we've bought our own house, and we just had a baby :-)  We're closer and stronger than we've ever been and it's been amazing to have this little miracle come into our lives.  He completes us.

February already!?
Oh my how the tables have turned.
Since my last post, I changed my mind about moving back to Maryland, decided to stay in San Antonio and buy a house, realized that Im still in love with T, went through hell waiting for him to grow some balls and tell the witch he's moving out, and tomorrow he moves back in with me.
:-)
Throughout all this we had discussions on 'US' and what went wrong and what things bother us, so we are going to make a go of it one more time.
I think sometimes guys get in the groove of the day to day hoopa and then you just kindof lose some of that spark - the key to holding onto your woman is treating everyday like its your last!
You just never know when time is gonna be up... course that goes for chicks to guys too

Update!
Havent been around much (Im a myspace junkie ;-)) so I thought I'd give you all an update.
Lets see - I had the gastric bypass surgery in August and have lost 81 lbs so far.
(Yay me!)
1/2 way there!
LOL
Feeling great and noticing it now and its pretty awesome.
I just got back from a vacation to Maryland - my friend candy flew in to drive it with me and we didnt have any problems.
Thank god for DVD players and travel PS1
LOL
The kids did great!
Paul moved out while I was gone.
I had made the decision to move back to Maryland this summer and he said he couldnt stay with me knowing I was leaving.
So he moved back in with the witch err I mean ex-wife.
(Yeah, just about knocked me over with that one too!).
So while home I saw how expensive MD was and it freaked me out so Ive decided not to go.
I also realized how much I love Paul, guess it takes losing someone sometimes to see the light.
So we're getting together and talking and just getting everything out to see where 'we' stand.
Its kindof a big mess...
if he comes back he'll be facing the witch's wrath, and the boys are going to be hurt that he's leaving.
Nothing's ever easy with us
;-)
So thats about it for now...
if you're on myspace search for ^^RAVEN^^ on the display name and you should find me
;-)
Happy New Year!!!

CARS
I don't care if you're a child or an adult or a little bit of both...YOU NEED TO SEE THIS MOVIE!!I took T, the 6 rugrats, my brother and his girlfriend and everyone LOVED IT.
The funniest bits were by Mater.
You know, like Tuh-Mater, without the Tuh.
His voice was Larry the Cable guy and he really made the movie.
I bet at least one of you if not all will walk out "MATER-fied" and talkin like a damn redneck.
LOL
I definitely can't wait for DVD!

Bar-b-que Season
Barbecue Season Is Coming! After the long months of cold and winter, we will soon be coming up to summer and BBQ season. Therefore it is important to refresh your memory on the etiquette of this sublime outdoor cooking as it's the only type of cooking a real man will do, probably because there is an element of danger involved.When a man volunteers to do the BBQ the following chain of events are put into motion:Routine...1) The woman buys the food.2) The woman makes the salad, prepares the vegetables, and makes dessert.3) The woman prepares the meat for cooking, places it on a tray along with the necessary cooking utensils and sauces, and takes it to the man who is lounging beside the grill - beer in hand.Here comes the important part:4) THE MAN PLACES THE MEAT ON THE GRILL.More routine....5) The woman goes inside to organize the plates and cutlery.6) The woman comes out to tell the man that the meat is burning. He thanks her and asks if she will bring another beer while he deals with the situation.Important again:7) THE MAN TAKES THE MEAT OFF THE GRILL AND HANDS IT TO THE WOMAN.More routine.....8) The woman prepares the plates, salad, bread, utensils, napkins, sauces and brings them to the table.9) After eating, the woman clears the table and does the dishes.And most important of all:10) Everyone PRAISES the MAN and THANKS HIM for his cooking efforts.11) The man asks the woman how she enjoyed "her night off." And, upon seeing her annoyed reaction, concludes that there's just no pleasing some women....
