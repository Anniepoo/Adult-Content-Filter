Aerobic Striptease Babe of the Day: Carmen Electra
Babes: Aerobic Striptease Babe of the Day: Carmen Electra: "Having problems getting your girl to dress up like a sexy librarian and give you a lap dance? Maybe it's because of the one doing the asking. Perhaps if it was suggested by another woman, and moreso, if your girl learned how, she might go for it.
That 'sexy librarian' thing is just one of the many glorious, glorious routines outlined and demonstrated by Carmen Elektra in her new DVD Series, Carmen Elektra's Aerobic Striptease.
Carmen has taken some time away from teasing hubby Dave, and focused some of that attention on teasing a few lucky cameras. These lucky bits of optical equipment have had the opportunity to witness, and record Carmen and some of her friends demonstrating a wide variety of erotically charged fitness techniques. Carmen also recruited some top choreographers and fitness professionals to co-develop these techniques.

'Carmen says she's all about babies at the moment,' says the source. 'She and Dave have been talking about starting a family. They're both eager and she said that Dave will make the best father reports Star Magazine. Another source close to the couple says 'Carmen and Dave want a baby so bad.

Carmen Electra can't make her stomach flat enough
Carmen Electra: Carmen Electra can't make her stomach flat enough: "Carmen Electra hates her body and claims she can't make her stomach flat enough.
The former 'Baywatch' babe says, although she eats healthily and exercises three times a week, she sometimes feels so disgusted with her body she won't let her husband touch her.
The sexy model - who is renowned for her curves - said: 'When anything bad happens, my insecurities come flooding out. 'I look in the mirror and pick at my flaws.
I hate my stomach. It's impossible to get it flat, and the area around my belly button drives me crazy. I hate it if my husband touches my stomach when I'm in that sort of mood.'
Carmen has also admitted she knew her marriage to first husband Dennis Rodman was a mistake - within hours of tying the knot."

Navarro urged to pay attention to Electra's hair
DAVE NAVARRO - NAVARRO URGED TO PAY ATTENTION TO ELECTRAS HAIR: "Rocker DAVE NAVARRO constantly frustrates his wife CARMEN ELECTRA - because he never comments on her carefully groomed hair.
The former BAYWATCH beauty, 32, says she'd be thrilled if her 37-year-old husband took more of an interest whenever she lightens or darkens her locks.
She says, 'He never has an opinion on my hair. It's so frustrating. I want him to say, 'Honey, I love it this way.' But he just says he likes it blonde or dark.'
But Electra admits her partner has a strong opinion about her wardrobe, adding, 'Sexy and low-cut. Tighter and shorter is what Dave likes.' "

Move Over, Pussycat Dolls: Here Come Carmen Electra's Bombshells
mtv.com - News - Move Over, Pussycat Dolls: Here Come Carmen Electra's Bombshells: "The Pussycat Dolls' monopoly on sexy Hollywood burlesque acts is over.
Carmen Electra, one of the celebrities who put the Pussycats on the map by guest-dancing with the troupe (see
'Christina, Gwen Stefani, Dita Von Teese Help Bring Back Burlesque'), has formed her own ensemble, the Bombshells. They debuted last month at a tsunami benefit headlined by Camp Freddy, the all-star cover band featuring Electra's husband, Dave Navarro (see 'Linkin Park, Jay-Z, No Doubt Rock The House To Rebuild South Asia').
'Dave looked at me and said, 'Why don't you get your girls together and put together a little dance show, then you can open up for us,' ' recalled Electra, who has been dancing since high school (the same Ohio school Nick Lachey attended). 'So I got really excited and called all the girls I know who are dancers. It's gonna have a little of that burlesque undertone, so you still get that sexiness and a little bit of a striptease element, but more modern with some hip-hop beats and some different cool stuff.'"

Electra's injection horror
CARMEN ELECTRA - ELECTRAS INJECTION HORROR: "Sexy actress CARMEN ELECTRA was so nervous about being given immunisation shots for a trip to Malaysia, she screamed as nurses administered the injections.
The former BAYWATCH beauty will arrive in Kuala Lumpur today (15MAR05) in preparation for Friday's (18MAR) FORCE OF NATURE CONCERT FOR TSUNAMI AID featuring BLACK EYED PEAS and LAURYN HILL.
And Electra admits that getting herself prepared for the trip was a dramatic experience.
She says, 'I had to get three shots and I'm afraid of needles. You have to get hepatitis shots, so I had two on each side and then the random one, I don't know if the doctor was just being silly, but it was for polio. Isn't that like from 40 years ago? Do people still get polio?
'Literally, I felt bad for all the people in the waiting room 'cause I was screaming. I'm such a big baby.'"
