Female Masturbation
sexloveqna:
1. Classic 4 Finger MasturbationThis is probably the most used technique. It’s simple to do and will work well for anyone that enjoys
lots of clitoral stimulation. All you need to do is find a comfortable
position where you can easily access your clit with your hand.Then it’s a simple case of holding your 4 fingers together and
rubbing them back and forth over your clit like in the diagram above.As with all the fingering techniques here, the key is experimenting
with the direction and pressure you apply. Some women will prefer
moving their fingers side to side, while others enjoy more of an up
& down motion that also covers their labia and rest of their vagina. While the 4 finger technique is great for reaching orgasm, it’s not
so good if you enjoy long drawn out ‘teasing’ masturbation. Thankfully
the next technique will teach you just that.2. U SpotNot many people seem to know about the U Spot. It’s the area of skin
just above your urethral opening and to the sides of it. To stimulate it
you just need to very gently stroke it with the tip of your finger like
in the illustration below. You’ll find that using lots of lube is best
to help keep it pleasurable. For some women, the U Spot can extend
higher than in this illustration, to right below the clitoris.3. Fingering YourselfI’ve covered a lot of masturbation techniques to bring yourself to
orgasm that focus on your clit. However, there are also a lot of great
techniques to make yourself cum that involve penetrating yourself.
Fingering yourself is the easiest.It’s a simple case of making sure that your fingers have enough lube
on them, using either something like coconut oil or your own natural
lubrication and then slowly penetrating yourself. While you can simply
stick your fingers in and out of your vagina to find out for yourself
what feels most pleasurable, I always recommend that you try stimulating
your G Spot as this is almost guaranteed to give you an orgasm.Your G Spot is located about 2-3 inches inside your vagina as you can see in the diagram and you can only find it when you are aroused as
I explain in the article on finding your G Spot. So if it’s your first
time, spend 10-15 minutes first getting yourself in the mood.Now it’s just a case of stimulating it. Insert 1 or 2 fingers and use
the tips of them to press it, massage it and rub it. 4. Love That Shower Head!If you haven’t yet used a shower head or faucet to get off then you
are missing out! While it’s not exactly a standard masturbation
technique, it feels incredible, yet quite different. All you need is a
faucet that you can maneuver your vagina under so that the water can
freely flow over it or a shower head that you can direct towards your
vagina.Everyone that tries it
reports that the running water feels wonderful and can help you get off
very, very quickly. So experiment with the settings on your shower head
to find out what feels best. Quick Hint: You may find that the ‘pulse’
setting is best
5. Delightful DildosThis last masturbation technique doesn’t involve your clit at all.
Instead you’ll be using a dildo to masturbate with and reach orgasm. The In & Out - The easiest way to masturbate
with a dildo is to simply push it in and pull it out of your vagina,
over and over. However, if you angle it a bit, then you can hit your G
Spot & A Spot which will be a lot more pleasurable.Using Your Dildo On Your G Spot - you first need to be aroused to hit your G Spot. Once you are, then you simply need to angle the dildo so that
it’s making direct contact with it. You can see the angle that you need
to make from the diagram below. Just remember that you really only need
short, shallow strokes to hit your G Spot. It’s about 2-3 inches deep.Using Your Dildo On Your A Spot - If you’d prefer to
go deeper with your dildo, then you’ll hit your A Spot, also known as
your anterior fornix. Make sure you are careful at first as you might
accidentally hit your cervix when looking for it, which is very painful.
If you are having trouble finding it, then you may need to experiment
with the angle of penetration a little bit until you find it.You can see in the illustration below that your A Spot is located
much deeper in your vagina, very close to your cervix. It’s location is
called the anterior fornix erogenous zone or AFE.6. In Da HoodSome women have a super-sensitive clitoris. So sensitive in
fact, that it can almost be painful to touch. If you are one of these
women, then you may find that using any of the masturbation techniques
that have been described above to be too uncomfortable…and possibly even
painful.If that’s the case, then instead of applying
pressure directly to your clit, you need to instead use your clitoral
hood as a buffer. That’s the flap of skin just above your clit that
covers it. I’ve indicated it in the illustration above with a slightly
darker shade of pink (in real life your clitoral hood has no distinct
color). So if you have an overly sensitive clit, then try rubbing your
clitoral hood instead of your clit. You’ll notice that it’s a lot more
pleasurable.7. Hood LifeNow, you may happen to be someone who suffers from a lack of sensitivity and
so need all the rubbing, grinding, touching & stimulation you can
get on your clitoris. No problem, to
allow yourself to stimulate your clit more heavily, you’re going to need
to expose it more. It’s easy and the demonstration above should be all
you need to expose it.As you can see, by placing your fingers above your clit and on either
side of it, then slowly pulling the skin backwards, you will pull back
the clitoral hood and expose it much more. Now you can use your other
hand or a vibrator to stimulate it directly.8. FeatherliteThe featherlite technique is just like it sounds, it involves a
‘feather light’ touch. It’s best to perform the featherlite technique
while lying down in bed, with your legs spread open. You’re then going
to use just one finger (usually your index finger) to gently apply the
tiniest amount of pressure to the very edge of your clitoris as
demonstrated in the diagram below.You’re only going to move your finger a few millimeters back and
forth making sure to apply only the slightest amount of pressure to your
clit. Many women report that it just feels too frustrating and they
can’t keep doing it for long, that it feels like they are teasing
themselves, while others report that the longer they do it, the better
it feels.At least try it and do your absolute best to hold out
for as long as you can, making sure to always use the very least amount
of pressure possible.9. Humping & Grinding Your PillowMany women first learn to masturbate through humping or grinding on
their pillow. It’s perfect for stimulating your clit and labia at the
same time. You’ll find that you get most friction, stimulation and
pleasure if you are wearing your panties or nothing at all while
grinding yourself off your pillow. Here are a few different ways to do
it.If you have a long pillow like the one above, you can lie down on
your side with it between your legs.Then grip it between your legs and
pull it backwards so that it is against your labia and clit. Then just
start grinding.
If you don’t have a long pillow like the one in the picture above,
grab a mid sized one and turn it on it’s side and straddle it. Or fold
it in half and straddle it, whichever works best for you. Then rest your
weight right down on it. Before you start grinding on it, you can
adjust it so that it’s firmly pressed against your vagina. Then simply
move your vagina up and down the pillow and ride it to orgasm!
Another great way to provide even more pressure and stimulation to
your vagina when pleasuring yourself is to cover your pillow tightly
with a towel before you start masturbating with it. This way you will be
grinding over your slightly more rough towel instead of your pillow. It
also prevents your pillow from getting wet. Bonus Tip:
You can also experiment with putting different things like stuffed toys
or electric toothbrushes under the towel for a different sensation when
reaching orgasm.
Using a pillow is just the start. Why not try grinding on your
man the next time you are making out with him. Simply straddle his thigh
and start grinding!
10. Vibrator TimeVibrators can give you the most intense orgasms…but
beware they can end up making your clit feel a little sore if you
use them too much.Everyone has their own personal preferences but here are a few ideas
to get you going:Some adore rubbing their vibrators all over their bodies and can even orgasm from using them on their breasts and nipples.
Some love feeling the vibrations indirectly on their clit. Direct stimulation can sometimes be too much. So use tip #9 if that sounds like you.
Some need direct stimulation on their clit to cum.
Some adore running their vibrator up and down their labia.
Some adore being penetrated by their vibrator.
If you are using a vibrator to masturbate play
around with it and see what gives you the most pleasure. There is no
“one size fit all” method to using a vibrator to orgasm. For more tips
& info on how to use your vibrator, check out this guide here.Source

Anonymous asked:
What if a girl is Fingered for very long will she start squirting?
yournudeindians answered:
It Depends! So listen up young man…Because I’m about to teach you something that very few men know how to do correctly (to be honest I wasn’t doing it right either until my buddy showed me).I’m going to show you exactly how to make women squirt… using only one hand… some lube and an open minded frisky woman.Warning: If the girl doesn’t trust you or you haven’t built enough comfort… she WILL NOT orgasm, let alone squirt. So you need to make sure she’s really into you before attempting this stuff.HOW TO MAKE WOMEN SQUIRT… FOREPLAY TECHNIQUES FOR THE G-SPOTThis is the good stuff, grab a coffee and take note big man:LUBE UP FIRSTTo intensify the pleasure, you should use a water based lube when using finger based foreplay which is what you will be doing here to make her squirt.A great natural lubricant is grape seed oil, which is also awesome for massaging as well as G-spot stimulation with the fingers.GET YOUR HANDS READYRemember that the vagina is a very sensitive area for a woman, so you must look after your hands… cut your nails, moisturise and keep them clean so they are soft and smooth.I’d even recommend getting a manicure.. yes I know it’s not manly, but it will make sure your hands are ready for her.LOCATE THE G-SPOTThe big “G” is a part of the urethral sponge and is located between 1 and 2 inches (2 knuckles) inside the vagina, along the front wall, which is the top if the girl was laying on her back basically.As a woman becomes a lot more aroused, you should feel the G-spot swell up and become more pronounced, this is a GOOD sign that she’s ready to be penetrated… but we want to save that for later as the aim here is to make her squirt.TECHNIQUE 1: STROKINGOk so the first the first technique is called “stroking”. To do this, take your index finger or middle finger… place it inside the vagina and go up, so you are touching the front wall.Now with your finger inside and touching the G-spot, begin stroking backwards and forwards, with a “come here” motion as if you’re stroking it. Don’t be too gentle, you need to be firm.Start with shorter slower strokes when you first enter, but build up momentum and speed up after a few minutes. Once she’s really getting into it, try two fingers (your index and middle fingers) and use the same stroking motion.Never use 2 fingers right away, always begin with 1.TECHNIQUE 2: OVERDRIVERight then… this is where the magic happens. Now that you’ve been stimulating the G-spot and stroking it for 10 to 15 minutes. You should feel it ballooning inside and she should be groaning with pleasure.This is the point where you want to take things into “overdrive”. For this you will need to be right beside her (like on your knees if you’re on the bed” and use both your middle finger and ring finger to penetrate the same spot.Now with your fingers inside, you need to rest the palm of your hand on the clitorous, almost cupping it. Once you’re in position, begin slowly stroking, whilst speeding up and then start to pull your hand up and down so you stimulate the clit at the same time.Speed up some more and be a lot firmer as you’re speeding up……Speed up EVEN more…. now some more…. and finally go as fast as you can until she climaxes (squirts) all over the bed.Now not all women will squirt, but a lot will. I’ve only had one girl who couldn’t squirt and I did everything correctly. You should feel the vaginal wall tighten and put pressure on your fingers, this means you’ve done the job well.Boom! You’re all done!By now your hands… the bed and her vagina should be covered in her love juice. Don’t worry it’s not pee, like some guys think. It’s ejaculate fluid which comes out of the urethra, not the vagina.The female ejaculation fluid comes from the skene’s gland and has a sweet taste to it (due to the glucose contents).THINGS TO REMEMBERGet some high quality lube – Water based lube is the best as it can be used with condoms also. You can still make a woman orgasm without lube, but it’s not recommended.Buy spare sheets– If she’s a “gusher” then you’re going to be going through a lot of sheets dude.Spruce up your place – Make sure your apartment is presentable, clean and comfortable. If she’s not comfortable, then you’ll have a hard time making her squirt.Take your time – It’s not a race, most girls will take around 20 to 30 minutes before you can make them squirt. However if you see the girl more than once and she’s very comfortable sexually around you, it will be seconds to a few minutes.So that’s how to make women squirt on demand… even though they are the basics they still work wonders. If you want to get more advanced with orgasms I suggest you watch this video.Squirting orgasms are seriously easy when you get the first one down, because you’re way more confident the next time.Reblog, and share the good deeds with your followers.
