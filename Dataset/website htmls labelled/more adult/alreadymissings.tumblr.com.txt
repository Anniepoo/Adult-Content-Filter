Living with Michael would be like:
stopitclifford:
• “y/n i made breakfast!”
• “y/n…… i burned breakfast”
• michael having no idea how to wash clothes
• “goddamnit i turned my shirt pink! my only white shirt!”
• platonic cuddles (or not-so platonic cuddles) everyday
• never wearing any clothes around the house bc why
• “so… pizza again?”
• “mikey we had pizza last night…. and the night before… and the night before that.”
• him giving you hundreds of nicknames even he can’t keep track of
• “hey butternut squash, can you get me a soda from the fridge?”
• 3am deep conversations on the couch abt feelings
• movie marathons
• “y/n luke looked really cute today, don’t ya think?”
• “okay snapback luke is way better than beanie! luke you can fight me y/n”
• basically alot of conversations about boys michael likes
• sneaking into bed with him sometimes because you both really want cuddles
• “michael, you cant keep getting hair dye on our couch.”
• “dont worry about it angel it looks like a picaso painting.”
• michael referring to you as ‘angel’ and ‘babygirl’ all the time
• essentially being michael’s best friend through and through no matter what
for @txhohood ’s roommate!5sos blurb night!

you were red; [listen]
you walked into the room and everything else ceased to matter. from the start you took the lead and I followed. you were my sun and I was your moon, your reflection, worthless without your light.
you liked me because I was blue; [listen]
you were red and I was blue. maybe thats why you liked me– I wasn’t you. I was something you’d never seen before. your fire and rage met my wind and calm.
you touched me and suddenly I was a lilac sky; [listen]
you became a part of me. you were the artist and I was your canvas, the clay for a sculptor. every touch of yours set me on fire, it changed me; moulded me into someone else.
but you decided purple wasn’t for you; [listen]
suddenly I was a lilac sky, but you didn’t seem to want that. maybe I’d become too much like you, I didn’t intrigue you anymore. did you become tired of my blue? or rather, did you miss it? maybe I’d changed too much.

Does anyone else ever just stare at someone looking at the lines on their lips or the curve on their nose or the colours inside their eyes or their freckles or the way their hair sits or their pink coloured cheeks, or the lines under their eyes, just because?

looking for a poc beta reader!!
clemmogram:
hi everyone, so for awhile I’ve been writing an ashton fic that features a poc lead character. the problem is that I’m (hella) white and so I don’t really know if anything that I’ve written strays out of my lane, especially in terms of character descriptions and what have you. basically, I’m looking for one or two poc fans (the character is black, although you don’t have to be black to offer to help!!) to read over what I’ve written and just make sure that everything matches up, and can even offer insight into where I can improve on character descriptions. (for example, I know very little about natural hair for black women, and could use some insight into it!!)
obviously this is my original writing, and I’m putting a lot of trust in whomever I share this with that they will not spread my writing as their own. if I learn that this is happening, I will stop writing and sharing abruptly- I plan on sending beta readers the story chapter by chapter. the people that I choose must be comfortable with sharing their emails with me: I’ll either email the documents to you or will share them on google docs, I haven’t decided yet. please do not offer to help if you will not be able to review chapters as I send them to you.
I’m doing this so that I don’t end up writing something that could sound off to poc readers, and to just double check that the descriptions I’m using are appropriate and solid. does this make any sense?? I don’t even know but ok
if you want to help:
submit your name, age, and your race if you feel comfortable sharing (but again, must be a poc for these purposes), and whether you would feel comfortable with me emailing you or sharing through google docs. additionally, please put if you would feel comfortable with conversing over text or whatsapp for comments and critiques. depending on how many applications I get, I’ll probably take a week or two to decide on who to pick, and will probably start up conversations through tumblr IM just to make sure that the people that I share this with will do so in confidentiality.
thank you so much in advance!! xx

why do people, namely men, act like fat girls are impossible to love? i hate to burst this bubble you’re living in, but fat girls can be in loving relationships, fat girls are approached, fat girls have sex (and don’t suffocate the person), fat girls are fawned over, admired, desired, and flirted with. and, yes, even by “conventionally attractive” and thin people. im tired of reading shit implying fat women are lower tier, a charity case, or second choices. just because you, personally, don’t find fat women attractive doesn’t mean yo boy jerimiah didn’t wear a pair of fat legs as earmuffs last week.

Anonymous:CALUM WOULD TOTALLY BE #9 OMG DONT FIGHT ME ON THIS MEGHANkinkhemmings:
I AGREE 100%!!!!“Hey, I got something for you today.” Calum said, stepping
through the door of your shared apartment. It wasn’t an unusual occurrence for
one of your to bring the other home something small when you’d been out all
day. You’d pick up Calum’s favorite cereal or a new pair of headphones (he went
through them like crazy) or he’d get you a book he saw or your favorite
flowers. “Oh, gimme!” You reached your hands out like an overzealous toddler
from where you were seated on the couch. “Not until you ask nicely.” Calum held the bag behind his back,
standing just out of reach.You stuck your tongue out at your roommate. “Please, Calum.”“You’re forgetting something.”You sighed. “Please Calum, you wonderful, sexy thing.”“That’s better.” He grinned, thrusting the bag forward. You
grabbed it, tipping it over into your lap. A little black jewelry box tumbled
out, and you shot Calum a look. You had an unspoken agreement that the gifts
weren’t to be above twenty dollars. “What-““Just keep going.” He said, rubbing his hands together. You
flipped the lid open, your breath catching when you saw the necklace in side.
You had passed it window shopping with Calum a few weeks before, and joked
about needing someone to lavish you with jewelry.“Oh my God.” You said, eyes flicking back and forth wildly
between him and the necklace. “Oh my God, I was joking, you didn’t have to
buy me this.”“I wanted to.” He said, sitting down next to you. “I wanted
to for a few reasons actually… do you remember what you said that day?”“Um,” You tried to think back to exactly what you had been
talking about. “Something about needing a boyfriend who’d buy me jewelry and
cuddle?”“Yeah, that’s pretty much it.” He nodded, scooting a bit
closer to you. “And, I mean, that got me thinking…”

kindahothough:pov !!POV — something that’s already happened, retold from another character’s perspectiveLuke could see the figures standing on top of the cliff. He hadn’t been cliff diving in a while, and just seeing them standing on the cliff as mere silhouettes made him want to be up there too. Maybe another day, but today was dedicated to surfing. Luke glanced back to Ashton, who was already on a wave, shredding across the surface. He was having a great day out on the waves. Luke glanced back up to the cliff just as he heard an ear piercing scream. His lifeguard trained eyes and ears knew it wasn’t a normal scream. He watched as the girl hit the surface of the water with a splash. Luke held his breath, waiting for the girl to resurface, but moments - minutes passed and she still hadn’t come back for air. Time seemed to move fast then. Luke hadn’t even realized that he was moving, paddling across the choppy waves to get to where the girl had jumped in. He abandoned his board, diving beneath the surface. The salt stung his eyes, but he could just see the ends of her hair splayed beneath the water. He tugged on her wrist, pulling her upwards until he could get ahold of the rest of her. And he hauled her onto his board, his heart racing. In all his years of training to be a lifeguard, Luke had hoped that he’d never have to put his skills to work. But he knew if it weren’t for him, she would have died. He hauled her onto the beach, pulling her from the board and went into quick action. He opened her airway, quickly blowing a breath into her mouth. And when she didn’t respond, his hands found her chest, trying to pump the water from her lungs. He muttered to himself as motivation to save her life. But with a few more compressions, she was sputtering, water spilling from her blue-tinged lips. And then her eyes were blinking open, wet eyelashes revealing the honey brown eyes he’d never forget for the rest of his life. ASK ME

Anonymous:first, last, before the beginning :)FIRST — the first two sentences of my current projectGreta always loved the irony of ballet. It was one giant contradiction - the fluttery costumes, the tutu’s and flowing motions. LAST — the most recently written two sentences of my current projectHer feet took a beating to the point where they bled, her muscles cramping from straining so long. But she also loved the irony of fate. BEFORE THE BEGINNING — three sentences (or more) about something that happened before the plot of my current projectGreta stepped through the door, pulling it shut behind her. Whenever she went over to the Clifford’s household, she never knocked, knowing that they would yell at her if she did. She waved to Michael sitting on the couch before heading up to his brother’s room. ASK ME
