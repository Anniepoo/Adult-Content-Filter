I sit at the table in the living room in the dark and outside snow falls.  The words come to me in a musical pattern that is soft and beautiful.  The words drift to my paper like snow.  Cello music is substituted for the muting of white --more suited for this peaceful place of color in my ear.

In a crowd of myself.  Seeing all the MEs.  I watch as they wander and wonder and bump into each other on their way to nowhere in particular.  I want to lasso them all and pull them close, get them to concentrate on the bouncing ball that hops over the narrative of our lives.  They are too far apart though and so I just watch as they grow further and further apart, too fragmented to ever come together, too me to ever be anything but what they are...

I sit in this chair and stare.  I can see everything but nothing touches me.  Time ticks by and by and I sink deeper and deeper into the faux leather.  Only my eyes and the top of my head are visible now--in case any cares to look.  I reach up and try to grab the arms of the chair but I'm already too far gone.  Soon enough I will see nothing and nothing will see me.

Lost and losing, everything confusing.  I'm done and not quite sure why.  If you could tell me, sell me, on this notion of time I might be agreeable but as it stands I can't befriend this mortal enemy.  Nothing good comes from it.  Nothing at all.

Sometimes you need a good friend to tell you that its okay to pursue a dream, that you only have one life and that you shouldn't live it under anyone else's terms.  In the back of my mind I knew this but sometimes the world puts pressures on you and you feel that you should be doing something else when the one thing you love to do is pushed aside.  Fuck it.  I'm not going to live my life wishing I had purued my true passion.  There may be consequences but I'd rather live with those than regret...

Really Dude?
Shut the fuck up already.
There's this guy at the gym who doesn't understand social boundaries.  He is constantly following me around the gym and trying to talk to me.  Yesterday, he trapped me on the treadmill and I was held hostage for 30 minutes while he went on and on about how taxing the rich was wrong and how high schools should be closed down and kids should go to charter schools and that sports were worthless in education.  He's a Republican.  I'm not.  There is no way in this lifetime he is ever going to convert me to become a Republican.  After about ten minutes of his bullshit I seriously wanted to throttle him.
The kicker of the story is that he is 30 years old, lives with his parents and is unemployed.  He won't work because the jobs available to him are beneath him, so he collects some sort of unemployment and plays video games all day.  I asked him why he was a Republican since he wasn't rich and he said, "that one day he would be rich."  I told him I seriously doubted it due to his lack of initiative.  He got flustered and insisted he would be.  I went on to say that his party doesn't want him to be rich and they are making it harder for the average person to rise up and be rich.  He just kept spouting off more propaganda.  Even stating that he won't have health care when he is older didn't phase him.  He has been brainwashed.
Here is a classic example of someone who votes against their own interests.  He sucks off the government teet and then wants to vote for someone that doesn't give a fuck whether he has health care let alone food and shelter.  Sorry, but the current Republicans care about one thing and one thing only and that is money.  I view that party the same way I do a pile of dog shit I step in when I'm walking in the yard.  It and they utterly repulse me.
This is not to say I am pleased with the Democrats.  They need to grow some balls and stop trying to negotiate with the right.  Can certain programs be cleaned up and made more efficient?  Sure, but that doesn't mean scrapping the entire government so a few individuals can become super rich.
If this guy's political party "wins" then he will lose and so will 99% of Americans.  And the sad part is that a frail guy like this won't make it in the future the Republicans have planned for him.  His video game playing days will be gone and he will be cleaning their toilets.  Even then he will probably still believe that one day he will find a golden turd and he will become rich and they will laud him and call them one of their own.

I remember seeing this kid on The Late Show a few years ago.  He was whacked out on some sort of drug and not making a whole lot of sense.  I think the reason for his visit on the show was to promote a book.  He was famous for something else which escapes me now but had become an "author."  His "book" contained one word.  Throughout the interview he was pompous and condescending.  He seemed to think his idea of a one word "book"  was brilliant. What I wanted to tell this kid was that his idea for a one word book was one of those ideas we all have after smoking a joint.  The difference is that most of us disregard these ideas later realizing that they are stupid.  What seems earth shattering while you're high doesn't necessarily translate into the clear minded world.  Evidently he didn't stay clear minded long enough to realize his book idea made him look like an immature ass...

Lost and dying in this place inside a place.  Where words never penetrate and happiness has no home.  The loneliness is waiting in the shadows to pull you in and devour you.  It will leave nothing but a skeletal soul and and the bits of flesh stuck between its rotting teeth.  The mat at your front door reads:  WELCOME.

Take from me everything I have.  The things that matter most.  Leave me behind in the dirt but don't forget about me.  Keep looking over your shoulder because I will always rise up again--stronger, badder and meaner.  Worry about that day, the one where you have to face me again.

It's sad when you think of someone as a friend and they turn out to be quite the opposite.  Self-preservation is important but being an extreme egotist is disgusting and shows to me mental weakness.  Anyone can be a pig, it's easy.  Just roll in the mud...

The cocksuckers that own the business I work at are cutting our pay and yet they want to charge my clients more.  They are the greediest pieces of shit I have ever encountered.  Instead of running a good business and finding ways to generate more revenue legitimately they are nickle and diming us.  Every paycheck they take a little more.  I would laugh if they died in a plane crash.  I don't think every life is precious.  I think you make your place in this world by how you treat other people.  If you are a leech and do nothing but suck the life out of other people I don't believe you have a place.  Oh, sweet karma please come back and bite these cocksuckers in the ass...

I don't have any more love to give.  It has been used up on one too many undeserving women.  It's not all bad though.  I've learned a lot.  I've learned for instance that I don't need love.  Sex will be just fine.  Thank-you and goodbye...

You don't know me.  You will never know me.  I'm not bragging.  I'm just saying.  You will never know the best side of me because I have yet to reveal it.  I'm waiting for the right moment.  The clock is ticking...

As I try to conjure words to put on the page my mind comes unhinged and the once loyal letters spill onto the floor.
They lay menancingly in a jagged heap. No amount of conjoling or threatening will lift them and as I stare they melt and shift and take shape and then realization hits me hard.
It is you staring back at me.
The murderer of my words.
The princess of my sordid fairy tale...
