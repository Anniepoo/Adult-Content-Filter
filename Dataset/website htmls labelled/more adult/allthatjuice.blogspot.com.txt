Rihanna was at Chris Brown's
18th birthday party held in New /York at the 40/40 club. The poor girl has some serious skin issues. I just wish she could cress like a young girl sometimes. I mean come on, she's only 19!

Jennifer Hudson won Best Supporting Actress for her role as Effie in DreamGirls. I'm so happy for her! No other American Idol reject has ever achieved so much. Not only did she win big, she also gave an outsanding performance along with her co-stars. You go girl!

NEW VIDEO FROM CIARA
Ciara shot a video for her latest single "Like A Boy". I think it's good because it's not the typical Ciara video look.
