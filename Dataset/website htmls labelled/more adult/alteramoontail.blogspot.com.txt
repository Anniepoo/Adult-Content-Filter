Going back to Cephon
Thanks to Square Enix coming out with the new Character Rename feature on the MOGstation.
I decided to go back to my original name as
ALTERA CEPHON
The lastname Moontail came from Yuniko Moontail who asked me during the relaunch of XIV ARR if I would change to it, and I did.
But as I dont see, hear or play much with her lately, I decided to go back to my original name that I was fond of.
And also, please update your bookmarks with
ALTERACEPHON.BLOGSPOT.COM
I will leave the Moontail blog up, but I have merged it with the old Cephon one I had before changing to Moontail :p

Commission Dump
Altera the blackmage, lost a 1v1 duel against Meymey the Monk.
Doesnt look like she minds the beatings she gets xD
Altera offering her "backdoor" to make a tentacle happy ;)
Bobbydando as the artist
The latest version of Altera, getting serviced by her old 1.0 and ARR 2.0 versions XD
Cant have too much Altera right? XD
Altera loves going through pumpkin patches during Halloween, as theres plenty of horny scarecrows and tentacle prone pumpkins to have fun with ;)
Lunareyes

These pumpkins became quite a fan of Altera's pussy, ass and throat, going quite deep inside XD

Maid to serve
Altera is trying to clean Miya's FC house, but she keeps being interupted to perform her other more sexual duties.
Altera doesnt mind it though. I think she like this more than cleaning xD

Altera goes to the Sun(ny) side
Messed around with the character creation again, and fell in love with the Slit eyes of the Sunseeker Miqo'tes.
And also with the current dark skin, the red and black color scheme for hair and eyes, was so common. So I tried another combination I have always liked, Black and orange gold.
I feel like the eyes look amazing with the dark skin. All glowing and wild looking :D
Don't think I will change Altera again as this style I fell really in love with :D
Hope you guys also like it hehe.
Sorry that Ive changed her a bit much, but shes still the same kinky kitty ;)

Altera gets Morbol'ed
Going for a dip in the Tangle probably would scare most people away as it is infested by Morbols, but Altera couldnt resists their tentacles and wanted to see how they were.
I think she will be going to the Tangle a bit more often xD
