A candid glimpse at our DD adventure

We're Back....
Okay just in case any of you are checking in on us, the dry spell has ended! I received my first spanking in a long time this afternoon.
Alex bought me this little mini dress thing that I now have to wear for spanking anyhow we are starting off slow so I received a round of hand spanks to warm things up and then 20 with the hairbrush, which of course I had to count out.
Boy did I forget that that thing can sting!!!We are making a commitment to getting back to our DD with a couple added things, first of course it getting back to the "rules", they are on here somewhere I will have to find them again. Second Alex told me that he wants to try a little chastity mixed in, this is on him, not me so I will keep you updated on that and finally he is going to get back to work on quitting smoking and has agreed to start attending church with the little miss and I as a family!!!
So you can see we have been up to lots of changes at our place.Hugs,Allie

Guess What???
Hi there,Well I know I have not been keeping up on this like I should, but life here is still pretty darn busy!
Hopefully after next weekend things will slow down.
Anyhow, I thought I would put a note out here to let you all know that I'm probably going to have some more to write about after tonight.
Alex and I decided it's time to get back to business and we have "scheduled" as he likes to call it a "reset" spanking tonight!
He's been telling me for the past couple days that I am going to have a little bottom fire cute huh? and I must say I got a few firmly placed swats this morning before we got out of bed, so Im thinking that the funk is just about over...Well gotta run things to do!
miss all of you guys and I really have to catch up on what you have been up to... Happy Spanking!!!!Hugs,Allie

Checking in
Well I thought I best put something out here since its been ages since I've had anything to say! sorry about that.
Not much has changed here, we are still working on our non spanking thing I do believe we are getting closer.
Our little miss has taken so to softball that our whole house has revolved around that for the entire month of May and part of June and now she made the all star team so we will be tied up until the first of July!!!
we are so proud of her, but man the running around does get a bit much.On the spanking note, Alex did threaten to paddle me this last weekend, but we just never got around to it, see I told you things were starting to get back to normal a little!
We just need to make time to do it.I hope everyone else is well and having great fun..Hugs,Allie

We're in a Funk....
Well you probably could tell that something is different here on our blog, I have to admit we have fallen into a funk, or a non-spanking block...We were going along pretty well and then we both got sick a couple weeks apart so no spankings took place and that is where we seem to be stuck.
I guess we need to set down and talk about it some more and refocus.
I dont want to give up on the "DD" again but we just dont seem to be headed the way we were.
Any advice you guys could offer would be help, that for sure.Hopefully we will be back to spanking again soon, we just have to figure out how to get out of our "blahh" space.
Otherwise things are good here..
Hope everyone else is having a great spanking time..Allie

Spanking
Well I'm being told that I will get a spanking tonight!!! yeah... I know that sounds dumb but I really feel like I need one, Im feeling pretty bitchy and very short tempered, so I'm sure it will help mellow me out and get me focused back to where I need to be.
I hope it will be one that starts out a bit slow and works it's way up they are my favorite.
I really am not fond of the rapid fire method, it's just too shocking to my behind and seeing that it has not been warmed up in a couple weeks it's likely to get tender pretty quick.
I guess that if probably why Alex tends to use the rapid fire method for those dreaded punishments.Well I'll post more later or tomorrow and let you know how it turned out.Hugs,Allie

Getting back to normal
Well things are getting back to normal here little by little.
Alex is feeling much better, thank goodness! and we are adjusting to the ball schedule better. Thankfully we only have 2 games this week.I did get a couple hard smacks on my behind last night for being a brat, something Im told we will take care of this weekend.. hmmmmm...Oh and get this, Alex told me my "extra" chore this weekend is going to be cutting out a paddle I designed, I have been tinkering with drawing one here and there so we'll see how that goes.
If it turns out well maybe I'll post a picture on here. Allie

Busy Busy
Well I havent written much on here lately, but life has been so hectic this last week it isn't funny!
Between work, and outside commitments there just was not an extra minute to be found.Hopefully this week will be somewhat better, but I know I have 2 nights of running for sure.As such there has not been any spanking going on at our place, Alex says I am way overdue since he has not properly spanked me in two weeks!!!
So I am sure one good one is coming my way pretty soon, though he woke up this morning not feeling very well I think his allergies are getting to him things here are blooming like crazy and that will do it.
So maybe not til the end of the week....Just wanted to say HI to everyone that reads us and let you know that I will try to be better about posting this week.Hugs,Allie
