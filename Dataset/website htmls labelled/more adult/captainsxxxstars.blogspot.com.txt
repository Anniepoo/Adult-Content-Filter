Some Really Hot Porn Star
Jenna Jameson   She was born in Las Vegas, Nevada. In 1990, at age 16, Jenna ran away from home and moved in with her boyfriend, a tattoo artist, her first serious relationship. Her boyfriend gave her what would become her trademark tattoo, double hearts, on her right buttock, which her brother, who would become a tattoo artist himself, later enscribed "HEART BREAKER". She then applied for jobs as a dancer in Las Vegas, and in 1991, she began dancing in strip clubs with the help of a fake I.D. Initially rejected from dancing at the Crazy Horse Too strip club because of her braces, they quickly relented when she removed them with the aid of a pair of needle-nosed pliers. She was soon earning $2000 per night, before finishing high school.By age 20, with her father's blessing, she posed nude in such magazines as Hustler, Penthouse and Chéri, and entered adult films in 1993. After a bidding war, Wicked Pictures, a pornographic film production company, signed Jameson to an exclusive contract in 1994.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Briana Banks   Stunning actress Briana Banks is a long-legged, German-born beauty who walked out on a boring job as an insurance auditor to begin a career in adult entertainment and has never looked back. “Even though I had made the cover of Teen magazine as a model," Briana says, "I wasn’t making any money. I was broke the day I quit my insurance job so I answered an ad in L.A. Weekly that said I could make up to $1,000 a day modeling.” The job led to a Penthouse centerfold and eventually to a contract with Vivid Entertainment.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Jesse Jane   Jesse Jane is an all American, blonde, green eyed, sultry girl originally fromFort Worth, Texas. She grew up on military bases in the mid-west, a vivacious tomboy and was often found playing center or fullback on the neighborhood ’s co-ed soccer team. Alluring, sexy, stylized motion film was eminently appealing and ensuing
research led her straight to Digital Playground.
Within months of signing with Digital Playground, Jesse landed a recurring role on ShowTime ’s Family Business. Their cameras followed Jesse around her first AVN convention and award show and onto her first movie set.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Janine   After graduating high school in 1986, Janine supplemented her income by working as a stripper. In 1987, she began modeling for Penthouse magazine, making her first appearance in the December 1987 issue, as the Pet of the Month. She appeared several more times in Penthouse over the next ten years, and was chosen as Pet of the Year Runner-Up for 1990.
Jaanine made her debut in adult films in the 1992 movie Andrew Blake´s Hidden Obsessions, quickly becoming a leading actress in the industry. She was known for the unusual reservation of only having sex with women on film - an agreement she reportedly made with her husband.
From 1993 - 1999 she was a "contract girl" (i.e., under an exclusive contract) for U.S. porn film leader Vivid Video.
