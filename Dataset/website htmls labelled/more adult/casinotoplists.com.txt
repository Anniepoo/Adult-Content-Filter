CasinoToplists - Your Online Casino And Game Guide
On this website, we’ve tried to create an in-depth guide to online casino gaming. We want to cover everything from the best casino destinations on the web to the optimal strategies in casino games online. To reach this goal, we have tons of articles on how to play the games, tools and flash games which allow  you to practice for free and different toplists which help you find the best site for you – whatever criteria you have when comparing casino rooms. We hope that the sections below will answer all questions you might have about gambling online.
What's Your Favorite Online Casino Game
On this site, you will find a list of the most popular games you can play on the net, whether it’s slots, blackjack, roulette, video poker (or anything else you can imagine), we have it all! Whichever category you choose to click on, we have articles covering the rules and strategies tied to that particular game, and trust us, you will benefit from learning the strategy before you wager any real money. Even though the casino always has an edge – that’s how casino games are designed – your chance of making a profit grows considerably if you make educated bets. Furthermore, every game section comes with a toplist with the best casino sites for that particular game.

Where Do You Live?
Where you live affects your choice of online casino. The best casino for UK players, for instance, is normally not the best one for US players. Different countries have different laws when it comes to gambling over the internet and it’s important to have this in mind when signing up to a site. To make this easier for you, we have unique pages dedicated to players living in:
-          United States
-          United Kingdom
-          Canada
-          Australia
However, laws aren’t everything. For a casino to climb higher on our country-specific toplist, it needs to offer games in your currency, provide the most popular games for your countrymen and have a good selection of payment options which work where you live.
What's Happening In The Casino World?
The landscape of gambling constantly changes. New laws are implemented – something US players are well aware of – and there’s always a debate about whether or not gambling should be allowed – both online and “on land.” In our news section, we follow these discussions closely; however, we also cover more online-gambling specific subjects. If there’s a new, amazing game released somewhere, if a jackpot is accumulating huge amounts of money, or if there’s a tournament with good value coming up, you can rest assured that we will write about it.

Do You Want To Be a Gambler On The Go?
The popularity of mobile gaming is growing very rapidly right now, every day, more and more people are downloading casino sites to their iPhones, Androids and other hand-held devices. On CasinoToplists, you will find a section dedicated to this form of gaming. We provide a list of cell phones that support online-casino software and guide you as to how to download and install the casino clients. You’ll also find a list with the best mobile casinos around – a list that we guess will be getting a lot longer in the near future.

Do You Feel Lucky?
A majority of casino players deposit, say, $50 for some slots, video poker, roulette, or blackjack entertainment. They want to win, of course, but they play because they like it. And when they win, the sums are often quite moderate. That being said, there is another type of gambler: the player looking for that big score. If you want to have a (slim) chance of winning a life-changing amount of money, you should take a look at progressive jackpots. The highest prize in this category is almost always seven figures. We get the values of the biggest jackpots in real time.

How Do You Fund Your Casino Account?
It doesn’t matter how good an online casino is if you can’t make a deposit and withdraw your winnings. The casino can have all the slots in the world and pay you 20 to 1 for blackjack – it’s still a bad site if it’s impossible to get real money into your gaming account. Again, where you live affects this greatly. Different countries have different regulations when it comes to online-payment options. To make this easier for you, we have a page with the most common payment solutions. There you can see which sites have what options, which allows you to make an educated decision about where to sign up and begin playing.

CasinoToplists - Your Casino Guide
So this is what we do -
We provide you with as much information as possible in order for you to compare casino sites. We want you to reach a safe and secure gambling destination with fair payout policies. And on top of that, we want the site to provide the games you like and offer a good bonus for signing up and making a first deposit. When you start playing, we want you to have all the information about how the games work so you avoid making costly mistakes, which most beginner casino players make.
