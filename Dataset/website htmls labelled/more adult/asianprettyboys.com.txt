How does
Eiress Wrinkle Cream
Work?
75% of our skin is comprised of water and collagen. Our skin is exposed to harsh UVA and UVB radiation resulting in age spots, fine lines, and wrinkles. As we age, our bodies produce less and less collagen, leading to the formation of wrinkles and fine lines.
Most anti-aging products use fragments of hydrolyzed collagen containing molecules too large to enter the skin with conventional formulas. Eiress’ breakthrough formula delivers whole collagen molecules directly into the epidermis. The peptide-rich Wrinkle Cream penetrates deep into your pores, repairing the messenger peptides responsible for cell communication by rebuilding the spring fragments of elastin.
Wrinkle Reduction And Prevention!
Skin loses elasticity as you age. It starts to sag, and you start to see the appearance of pesky fine lines around your forehead, mouth and eyes. Fight signs of aging with Eiress The active ingredients will help you reverse the look of aging by hydrating your skin to restore its natural moisture balance, fading the look of fine lines, and improving the overall tone to reveal skin that looks visibly younger!

Your skin is the largest organ on your body but one of the most exposed. As a child, your skin is smooth, healthy and vibrant.
But as we age, it can become wrinkled, saggy and discolored. Why?
Each of these factors reduce our skin’s ability to keep its elasticity and firmness.
Age also leads to the loss and breakdown of collagen in the dermal layer of your skin.
Collagen is key to provide structural support to your skin. As our body’s produce less, your skin begins to sag and wrinkle.
Your best defense against these hostile factors is choosing the right skin care product that may help reduce visible signs of aging. Eiress is just the solution!
Our skin dries and loses its elasticity as it is exposed to a host of factors which attack your skin including age, wind, dryness, sun damage and free radicals.
