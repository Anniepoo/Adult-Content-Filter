Performance & Mindset Coaching
I support my clients to gain the confidence, motivation and attitude, to deal with what ever is troubling them. It usually only takes a few sessions to see results that can last a lifetime.  My approach is based on knowledge of how our brains work and how we can unwittingly be programming them to work against us. I use tools and techniques that will help you develop your confidence and motivation, and adopt an attitude that will support what ever you want to achieve. I specialise in Personal Coaching, Sports Performance Coaching and Rider Coaching.
