The training of Asian cock pets
I am the master of my Asian cock slave.
I am white, though that doesn't matter as much as that which I have in common with other dominants who use Asian cock pets for their cocks' pleasure.
I see a lot of these white/Asian
race play blogs that are laden with no shortage of racist labels and derogatory racial tones.
“Inferior Asians,” “Gook,”
“Chinky,”
Etc.
People are going to do what they want to do with their blogs, but I don’t like it.
I am no racist.
I just happen to be dom who finds Asian women to be the most beautiful on the planet.
I also have found that they are simply “hard-wired” for fun.
They typically have tiny, tight pussies, become out-of-control horny once aroused, are loud, ultra-sensitive and responsive, and multi-orgasmic.
They also tend to be thin, which I like. That has been my personal experience, at least, as a white male.
It seems white men/Asian women are a perfect match, racially.
I’m sure its the same with black men, but I can’t speak for them..
Frankly, my wife is my sub.
The truth is that I love her deeply, and we have something most couples do not.
(I know, I was married twice before)
I do not look down on my wife, nor do I care to ever really hurt/injure her, or force her to do anything she doesn’t want to do.
I don’t make her walk around the house nude, or “be” a table for me to set a drink on, or any of that nonsense.
The plain truth is that the dom/sub is sex play for us, and nothing more.
We simply found that I am aroused by dominating her, and she is aroused by being dominated.
She was a virgin when we met.
As soon as she got over the initial pain of being “broken in,” almost from the start, she always loved being pounded hard, deep, and FAST.
She would even ask for it in pillow talk.
(HAMMER ME, baby!)
I suppose that’s how it started, in a way.
Then one night, when I was basically telling her what to do sexually, she surprised me by saying, “Yes, Master!”
Well, I didn’t need anymore prodding.
I took her lead, and we’ve been a dom/sub couple ever since.
Now, I don’t know what others REALLY do in their personal lives, Again, we are a perfect match in more than a few ways.
We talked about it once in bed, toward the beginning of our dom/sub awakening, and I wanted to make sure we were doing something she wanted to do, not something she was doing only to please me.
Her answer was simple:
“I like my man to take charge.”
Some of you reading this will recoil in disgust.
“Why, you’re no real dom at all- you’re a phony!”
Some of you may being saying.
"Well, you have a right to your opinion."
At least what I’m telling you here is real, and is the truth.
When I write about the things I do to my sub, at least you’ll know its not all bullshit.
Now, I don’t know what everyone else does in their private lives, but lets be serious- we all know damned well that many of these people are completely full of shit, and are just playing out their fantasies on tumblr.
Hell, a number of them are probably 14 yoa boys spending all their time in front of the computer in their bedrooms- probably virgins.
Well, that’s their prerogative.
But before some of you write me off as a “phony,” just think about who is the real dom- the one who BSs you about how they are a dom 24/7, and their subs are waiting at the door for them when they get home, nude, on their knees, and wearing a collar- (I guess some may be out there) or me, when I’m telling you the real stuff that goes on between us?
At any rate, I’ve decided I will no longer re-blog anything that is degrading on a racial level, or that uses any slurs.
I have up to this point, only when I found the posts highly hot, but from now on, I will either edit them and make them my own, or not re-blog them.
Regards.

How to turn your woman on to a sub/dom relationship?
I recently was asked by a male follower: “
I’m a Male, 24! And I have a girl wich I’m introducing to this way of think
Do you have any advice for a proper introduction and relationship?”   Rather than keep my long answer only to him, and risk re-typing my advice at a later time, I thought I’d share it with all of my followers, so here’s my response:    “Hmmm… in my experience, a woman either is turned on by
being dominated or not.  Some find
arousal in either role.  Some simply
don’t like any of it.  At any rate, I
would wait until both you and she are very secure both in your relationship
outside of the bedroom as well as in.
Deep trust is CRUCIAL to the dom/sub relationship.  You have to trust that she is going to accept
your role and keep your confidence about it, and she has to trust that you are
only going to dominate her to the extent that she allows.  (One would simply be foolish to allow a
sadist or psychopath to bind and have their way with them once they are
helpless in a private setting)      As with anything, start small.  For example, if she’s highly aroused and
pleasured by a certain stimulus you give her, use that as a tool.   For example:    I’m lucky to have an Asian sub, and they are
typically very sensitive,  responsive, loud,
and mult-orgasmic.  My sub/wife is VERY
stimulated by my fingering her G spot.
She will orgasm over and over every two minutes or so when I do
this.  (If allowed)     If you’ve found a
strong trigger for her like this, TALK to her while you’re doing it.  "Oh, you LIKE that, don’t you?  You LOVE it.
You LOVE it, DON’T YOU?“
Assuming you get a positive response, tell her to repeat what you’ve
told her.  If she responds by saying,
"Yes,”  tell her to "say
it.”  If she doesn’t quite
understand that you mean, say, “TELL me you LOVE it.  SAY IT!”
If she says what you order her to say, chances are that she’s receptive
to your affinity for the dom role.  If
you get this positive response, take it a step further.  Say, “THIS is MY PUSSY.”  (If your'e lucky, she’ll simply repeat on her
own, but if not, prod her along)
“Tell me WHOSE pussy this is!”
If you continue to get positive responses, you’re probably well on your
way at this point.       If so, TALK about it after sex, gently.  ASK her if she liked what you did, and talk
to her in depth about it.  Gauge the way
you continue the conversation by her responses.
If she continues to be positive, continue probing deeper with your
conversation.  If you continue in this
way, you will probably learn what you want to know      If you’re lucky, you’ll get more than
just a positive response… if your girl has natural proclivities toward being
a sub, she may skip a few steps in your conversation and just tell you right
away that she was TURNED ON by your dominance.
Another thing…
Don’t be surprised if your woman is normally very confident and assertive in
public and has a penchant for being submissive and for being dominated in
private.  It is often like this,
especially in today’s society.  Women
nowdays are encouraged to assert themselves and claim their equal place in the
social and professional strata of our modern world.  Feminists even seek to make them feel weak if
they don’t do so.
(Once, during an after-sex
conversation with a publically assertive partner, she surprised me by nervously
shielding her eyes and telling me, “You know when you smacked my nipples hard
with the riding crop?  That TURNED ME
ON!”)     Because of this
social atmosphere, many women will behave as expected in public (And let’s be
honest… its normal for a confident person with self-esteem to demand respect
in the world- such normal people don’t wish to be used as door mats) but will
enjoy the release from such social “obligations” by being under the
control- real, or imagined- of a dominant.
Others will be repressed by morals under which they have been raised
that “good girls” don’t enjoy sex and erotic acts, and feel free to
enjoy such guilty pleasures by being absolved of any responsibility under
restraint or force -real or imagined.  In
this same way they are released from responsibility for their actions by a
blindfold, mechanical or physical restraints, or physical punishment.  Some women have “daddy issues,”…
that is, they had cruel fathers who resented them for not being sons, or
refused to recognize them as loved and wanted, or simply abandoned them, and
can only allow themselves to receive pleasure and intimacy after the atonement
of being “punished,” restrained, or dominated.  (Or all of the above)   Again, in this way,
many otherwise "powerful” women may surprise you once you are alone
and intimate with them.
Start here, and get back to me when
you get some feedback from her, and good luck!”

sanoik-a-thai-slut:
For Asian women, sex is a way to express femaleness and power. The power to decide.The freedom to fuck who we want.
White people interprets the sexual eagerness of Asian women by white men as self-contempt, vulgarity, promiscuity, frivolity … morally reprehensible things. And they despise them for it. In addition to the racial prejudice.
The result is that white men use Asian women as sex toys, thinking that they like it, or that they do not deserve more than that. It is a sad and unfortunate situation.
Because it is only a matter of time for that to scare off Asian women of the white man. An Asian woman was hurt by a white man, never will want to get close to one of them.
And I want the relationship between white cocks - yellow pussies, never ends.     Although of this relationship require further adjustments.
