Most Beautiful Thing I Saw Today // pt2
Apologies for lack of posting, I've been a busy boy...Here is the most recent beautiful thing I saw today, (not this image but similar) at the Royal Academy of Arts exhibition; the work of Antony Micallef. Shockingly brilliant!

Most Beautiful Thing I Saw Today // pt1
I look for beauty, to avoid seeing horror. I'm going to make a point of recording the most beautiful things I see each day, be they real or discoveries on the internet.The most beautiful thing I saw today was the work of Jose Parla.

Oh yes please!
Eugen Bauder + Jägermeister, what better mix could there possibly be and how envious I am of the photographer who took advantage of this beautiful boy. Jäger tastes like cough medicine so it must be good for you.Photography by Joe Lally for The Imagist.

Some cool work over on the website of photographer Ryan Pfluger. I like a lot of the editorial projects more than the personal work, although "men i've met" has a few cocks in it, which is all good! lol.dominik studio session, 2008It's ALL good!
