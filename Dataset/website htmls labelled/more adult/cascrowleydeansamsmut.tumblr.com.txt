You grab your bags from the cashier, grunting at the weight.
You didn’t realize you had bought so many groceries.
No wonder the bill was so high.
Walking to your car, you stop to readjust the bags.
Just then, the bottom of the bags collapse, releasing themselves of your groceries.
The fixings for tonight’s dinner and the next week’s lunches were strewn on the wet ground.
Apples rolling under cars, cans and boxes getting dented and broken, eggs smashing and leaving a yolky, gooey mess at your feet.
“Dammit!”
you swear, leaning down to try to collect what you can.
A wind picks up, lifting the lighter things from the ground and blowing them across the parking lot.
Your eyes follow your dinner as it disappears behind the multitudes of cars.
This was typical.
The way your day started was awful enough.
Your boss yelled at you, your sister called to cancel your double date tonight, and your boyfriend…..well, let’s just say he’s not your boyfriend anymore.

Suit and Tiedisneyings:
Shockingly enough, I’ve surprised myself by how much I want to write smut. It’s awkward.. I’m still going to take requests for non-smutty imagines and I’m still going to write them, don’t worry.
WARNING ; Smut
Sam x Reader
Sam sits across the dance floor from me, his legs stretched out in front of him with his tie loose. Dean has just gotten married and surprisingly, I think half the hunter population showed up. And a ton of angels, seeing as it was Castiel’s wedding, too. I’ve not gotten used to Hannah, I can’t really say I ever will.
She’s so.. I don’t know. Annoying?
Claire is sitting next to me, chatting with Balthazar about how great the wedding looks and how much she’d wish she had gotten here earlier. She missed the actual marriage part, but Dean and Castiel didn’t seem to mind at all. Balthazar, on the other hand, showed up too early and drunk. I had to wrestle him into a bed and make him stay there until the wedding started.
I wasn’t going to have him ruin the wedding by being the drunk of the crowd.
Sam has been ignoring me since he got here, it’s heart wrenching, but I don’t dwell on it for too long. I was, in fact, Castiel’s Best Maid of Honour. There wasn’t really much I could do, except get the wedding the way it is. Dean and Castiel are doing some weird, too-painful-to-watch dance.

Please Stayilostmyshoe-79:
I combined a request from i-rule-the-night and two anons for this angsty Cas fic. Hope everyone enjoys it!
Summary: Cas and the reader, are friends, but lately, he’s been ignoring her. She finds out why as she realizes she has feelings for him.
Word Count: 2700ish
Warning: Smut, so much angst, minor violence
A/N: abaddonwithyall, enjoy your Cas feels.
“Be careful!” Dean scolded. “You’re going to drop all that.”
You gingerly placed the armful of guns you were carrying into the trunk of the Impala, rolling your eyes.
“I’m stronger than I look, Dean.” Keep reading
