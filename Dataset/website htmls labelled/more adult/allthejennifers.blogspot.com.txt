Anniversaries (or... why the hell does something that happened a year ago matter to me anyways?)
What is it about a date in history that triggers emotion? Have we engrained it within our culture, or was it already there locked in our morass of genetic code?I was chatting with an old friend, someone that I worked with a few years back. Both of us had since moved on from that job to what were to be greener pastures. I was the first to jump ship, but things definitely did not go as planned. I moved because my then-wife wanted us to, and things took a serious nosedive. The next year was the pits, work was hard to find other than part-time jobs, and things just generally fell apart.Finally almost a year to the day, I got a break and got a nice job. More money, more vacation, more perks than where I had been working, it looked like we'd paid our dues and could reap some rewards. About a month later, she told me she was leaving me. So there I go, down another long dark year... and it got pretty dark let me tell you. It was 13 months before it was "resolved" at least as far as the courts were concerned. I've spent the last 10 months moving forward, trying to enjoy my "new life".Now I'm "here". For months I really haven't paid much thought to my ex, my marriage, the past. I didn't even notice when my wedding anniversary had gone by. So I was taken by surprise when last week I started to feel down. I wasn't exactly sure why. Work has been a royal bitch, but hey, it's work afterall. I'd just been tossing around the idea of taking a trip to get out of town and spend a few days with my old friend. Still, I just felt... a little hollow. I was having dreams and memories I hadn't had in quite a while, images of my marriage. I wasn't missing her, but I seemed to be missing what I had. I hadn't even been paying attention to the date (in case you haven't guessed, that is one of my faults). Saturday during a long drive I was trying to dig into myself and figure out what was going on. Then I realized... Friday was the day she told me she was leaving me.Two years later, out of the blue, bam! Funny thing is, I was so angry with how the divorce was going last year, that the first "anniversary" of that day didn't even get noticed. Got me the second time around though... fucker.It's annoying as hell how much this is screwing with me. My mind is so clouded. I'm numb, lost, frightened, and just generally wondering why I should bother with anything, because no matter how hard you try, you'll lose. I should have grown up to be an asshole. The proverb is wrong you know. It's not the meak that will inherit the Earth, it's the assholes. Caring about only yourself is definitely the way to go. Be selfish, be arrogant, be greedy, be manipulative, being a lier helps too. A well-placed lie will get you anything you desire.And so the anniversary of her leaving me, will be followed shortly by the anniversary of my divorce becoming final. You know the final reason it would be nice to be an asshole as described above? Not caring for anyone but yourself allows you to ignore silly things like sentiment and emotion. Now I'll end this little ranting update, and go sit in a corner and see if I can find enough superglue to fix my pieces of mind.

The Simple Life
First off, I'd like to say that Paris Hilton wouldn't know the simple life if it grabbed her by her "perfectly" styled hair, took her manicured hand and slapped her silly with it. For that I pity her.This post comes from a visit from my girlfriend this past weekend. It was the first time she has come up to see me, and the first time she has seen my apartment. She was... shocked I suppose would be the correct word. She also took a number of playful jabs at my living conditions. No, I wasn't upset or anything, I laughed right along with her. You see, I'm living pretty minimalistically right now.I didn't take a lot away from my divorce. I took what I wanted, what I felt was mine, but I left most of the "household items". The ex was always picking out the furniture, etc, anyways, and I didn't particularly want what she had chosen. Ironically, she kept things that had been mine before we had even met (the reverse was not true), but at the time I didn't really care. Now I just occasionally wonder if it was because of ways I had "rubbed off" on her, or if she was just trying to hurt me a little more *shrug* but then I remind myself that it doesn't really matter anymore anyway.So here I am. I live in a small one bedroom apartment. The bedroom doesn't have a bed, there's just a couple of dressers storing my clothes. I sleep on an air mattress in the living room that lies behind my computer chair (convenient for when I've been up waaaay too long playing on the computer, just spin the chair around and fall out of it into bed and pass out). Aside from the computer desk, chair, and a table supporting a small TV, the living room is almost as spartan as the bedroom. Needless to say, I don't do a lot of entertaining right now, although I would have plenty of room for dancing.There is something to be said for minimalism. Too often we seek happiness in "things". Now I'm not saying materialism is bad... in moderation. Our society puts too much emphasis on it though to be healthy. There is something to be said for getting back to the basics, and there is nothing more basic than the fact that you make yourself happy. No person you meet, no thing that you buy, no place that you visit will make you happy. It's all on you.So my girlfriend got a chuckle out of how I'm living right now. Well that's ok, because I am more at peace with myself than I have been in years, and a big part of why is that nothing is getting in the way.

Trying to make a sharp left turn
As is likely apparent from my last post, I've been in a funk about life and especially people as of late. The last few days have had me buried in work, but finally over the weekend I decided it was time to heal myself as it were. I write (poems, stories, random snippets) when the mood strikes, the topics vary greatly, though I will admit that sex is a popular one. Unfortunately, my carpal tunnel has been acting up the last couple of days, keeping me from being able to type comfortably, but it has given me a chance to revisit things I have written in the past... I thought I'd share one.........I lie you down on the table. You are to place your arms above your head, and spread your legs.... you wait for the ropes to hold you in place. You're not sure how this involves serving me dinner, but you're imagination is tossing out all sorts of luscious ideas and you notice your heart beating a little faster as they play in your mind.Once I have you bound, I take out some lightly scented massage oil. Starting at your hands, I begin to slowly work my hands over your body, rubbing the oil into your silky soft skin. Down the length of your arms, across your chest. You feel my fingers squeezing your breasts and moan in relaxation and delight. I continue down over your stomach, then hips, finally working my way down each leg. It has the odd combination of working out the tension of the day, but replacing it with the excitement of the moment.I return to the head of the table and after a few moments, you feel something slightly warm running down your fingers. I place the bottle of honey on the table where you can see it, and then begin to lick the sweet nectar off of your hand. You feel a slight rush of warm through your body as I take each of your fingers into my mouth, sucking on them, my tongue curling around lapping every drop off of them. And then I repeat with your other hand...When I finish, I lean over you and kiss you deeply. My tongue slides into your mouth and yours meets it in passion. You can sense the faint taste of the honey and you squirm ever so slightly remembering the sensations of a few moments ago.Next I walk around and pick up a bottle of chocolate sauce. I look up at you smiling as I begin to drizzle it between your breasts and down your belly. Then I take a strawberry, and draw it through the pools of chocolate, swirling it across your flesh, covering it thoroughly... then I open my mouth, extending my tongue. Your breath catches slightly as you watch me lick some chocolate off of the berry before popping it into my mouth... you wish I were licking somewhere else.The next berry I offer to you. I hold it just to your mouth, and then smear the warm chocolate over your lips. You giggle a bit, and then open up and I deposit the juicy fruit upon your tongue. You smile as your bite into it, and I lean over to kiss you again, ending with my tongue slowly licking over your chocolate covered lips.A few more berries, and then I lean in to clean up the remainder of the chocolate myself. You giggle and moan as I lick, nibble and suck along your belly and between your breasts.. not letting any of the chocolate go to waste.Next I walk to the kitchen, and return with some vanilla ice cream and a small scoop. I put the ice cream on the table, then take the scoop and touch the back to your nipple. You draw a sharp breath as the cold metal contacts, your nipple stiffening. I growl softly and can't resist... and you involuntarily stretch out as I lean down and flick my tongue over your hard nipple, once, twice... a third time.Then it's back to my dinner. I scoop out a small amount of the creamy vanilla and place it right over your nipple. You squeal and shimmy a bit from the chill and I chuckle a bit, the combination of mischief and lust clearly evident. After a few moments, as your body gets over the shock, I lean in and cover the ice cream, and your extremely hard nipple, with my warm mouth. The combination of cold and warm sends a pleasant buzz through your body. My tongue swirls the melting cream around your breast and you feel a trickle running down the side. I suck and play with your breast, licking up all the cream and then continuing... making you moan louder. I stop and then move to your other side. Again, the shock of the cold ice cream, but I am quicker to draw your tit to my mouth. I am feasting on you now...Quickly the ice cream has disappeared and my tongue is lashing at your hard nipple, and at the flesh of your breast. I reach across to massage the other and your moans increase. I look up to see you biting your lip, your eyes closed as I suck hard on your nipple, while swirling my finger around the other. Then you buck slightly as you feel my teeth bite into your stiff nipple. I pinch the other one, tugging it into the air... the pain / shock / pleasure / ecstacy has you positive your pussy is dripping with desire.I move to the foot of the table, my hands slide up your thighs. I can see you are wet and I smile hungrily. Leaning down I part your pussy lips and draw my tongue across the length of your pussy and over your clit. You moan loudly and its music to my ears. A seconds wait, and then again, another long hard lick across your pussy. Another second, and another lick, this time my tongue starts to swirl over your lips and the delicate areas inside. Your hips buck and grind as you try to get more.I pull your pussy open wider and my tongue flutters over the pink folds inside, soft, then hard, then soft again. I use my fingers to massage the out folds while my tongue stretches as deeply inside of you as I can manage. When I know you need more, I slowly slide a finger into your soaking wet pussy. As I do, I swirl my tongue around your clit. I circle my finger around, slide it in and out of your tight hole. I find a rhythm between that and lick and sucking your hard clit that quickly has you pulling at your bonds, squirming, panting, moaning, screaming. Your hands grip the ropes that hold you, you try to raise your legs but they are held fast. You spread them as far as the ropes allow out of instinct, out of need.The orgasm crashes over you, wracking your body with pleasure. You body stiffens, your hips rise up forcing your clit and pussy into my mouth. Slowly I bring you down, my finger slowing it motions in and out of you... my tongue lightly licking across your pussy, as I savor the taste of your cum.When I finish, I stand up and release your legs from their ropes. I then move to your side and lean over to hug you comfortingly, kiss you deeply. The blissful look on your face makes my smile.After a few moments, you tug at your wrist trying to wrap your arm around me. Not yet baby, you still haven't eaten yet. I walk around to the head of the table, and place my hands under your shoulders, drawing you down the table until your head just hangs off the edge. I quickly reach up to gropes your voluptuous tits as my hard cock waves in front of your mouth.You open your mouth, your tongue coming out to lick the head of my cock. You taste my pre-cum and moan in delite. I push forward and your lips part, allowing the head of my dick inside. You start to suckle on it and I moan as I feel your tongue swirl around the tip. My fingers grip your tits a little tighter as my excitement builds.I thrust farther shoving more of my cock into your hungry mouth. My balls, tight with cum, dangle in front of your eyes. My cock pulses in your mouth, growing harder, longer. I give your nipples a tight pinch as more of my shaft slides between your lips. You moan loudly and reach up take more of me. You can feel me near your throat, hear me growl in desire.I want you good and hungry for my cum, so I shift and you feel me reaching farther down your body. My fingers come to rest on your pussy and you raise your legs up to give me more access instinctively. Then you feel a sudden buzzing and let out a muffled squeal as you feel the vibrators first touch.I draw my dick out of your mouth and you moan and beg me to stick it back into your mouth. I reach down and take it in hand, smacking you in the face with my hard cock. I press the vibrator down between your pussy lips and the head of my cock against your other lips... and then both slide inside of you.I feel you bathing me with your tongue as I fill your mouth and slide down your throat. I hold it for a second, you choke just bit before I slide back out. The vibrator continues to excite you and you eagerly give way as I start to fuck your mouth. You see my balls and envision the cum inside of them flowing into your mouth. And then I lay the vibrator over your clit and you try to scream in pleasure... it comes out wonderfully muffled by my dick stuffed in your mouth.I reach down and grab the back of your head start to thrust into your mouth and down your throat. At times it's hard to breath as your try to gasp from your own pleasure. You shift between excited pleasure and a thrilling panic as you realize your body is being used and pleasured at the same time... and your only thought is for me not to stop.And then you hear me utter a growl like some beast in the wild. You feel my cock pulse, the stream of cum exploding against your throat. You eagerly try to swallow every drop as you feel me forcing my cock down your throat my balls right up against your face... and just as you think it's over... you cum again from everything... the vibrator, the lust, the savageness, the comfort, the trust... all blends to bring you another moment of ecstacy.When all is finished, I untie you and take you into my arms. We make our way to the bath and enjoy a nice soak in some soothing warm water with lots of bubbles. You lay back against me, wrapped in my arms... and we talk about how nice it is to have dinner with someone special.

If this is evolution, I think I'd like it better as a single cell
Every species on the planet evolves and adapts. It does so, or it dies off. This is simply the harsh reality of life. We possess two of the most important evolutionary advantages of any species on Earth. The first is the opposable thumb.Few creatures besides ourselves have this advantage. It has allowed us to build, to cultivate, to adapt our surroundings to us instead of having to adapt to them. It has also allowed us to kill. Now before anyone starts, all creatures kill. In most cases, they kill to survive, whether killing for food, or to defend themselves. However, all of those creatures were born with their weaponry. We have had to create our own, to fit into the palm of our hands. From the first crude club, to a modern firearm, our hands allow us to do what no other creature can... improve on our method of killing. Why nowadays, you can kill someone without even drawing blood. Death of character, death of identity, are both as certain a way to "kill" a man using nothing more than a pen or a computer.The second advantage we possess is that of desire. No other creature on this globe wants more than to eat and to procreate. Want is really a misnomer, because they do not do this consciously, it is in their nature. We humans however, know desire. For every need in life, our desire forces it to another level. We do not just need to eat, we desire to gorge ourselves on what pleases our taste. We do not mearly wish to procreate, we desire others that suit our lust. We are, afterall, the only species that enjoys sex, that has sex simply because it feels good. Desire, like all things in life, can be good or bad. It is desire that made us sail the ocean. It is desire that pushes us toward the stars. It is also desire that makes a man abuse his wife. It is also desire that makes a dictator commit genocide on another people.We have been granted what equates to the ability to achieve anything and the will to achieve it. The question is, what is "it"? Well, I'll warn you all now, I'm feeling a bit cynical as I write this. My observations over the years tell me that "it" is always nothing more than self-gratification. Nothing is ever done for the sake of another it seems. Even what is seen as a good action, is done for money, or done for glory. People are always out for the power they desire; Power over a person, power over a group, power over a situation, whatever the case may be. People always desire power, and they will manipulate, scheme, coerce, intimidate, brutalize, and whatever else it takes to gain the power they crave. I'm left wondering, where does that leave me?There was a time, many years ago, when I could scheme and manipulate with some of the best of them. No, I didn't do anything overtly bad, nothing criminal anyways, but I did manipulate for my own self-gratification, my own ego. At some point I discovered, it wasn't worth it. Yet in the years since then, I have been accused of doing things to manipulate people, to get things from others, when it was the absolute last thing on my mind. The most amusing point of that is that when I actually WAS doing such things... nobody ever noticed. Life is full of irony. So here I am thinking I am different, that I no longer give into desire for its own sake, and I'm wondering what's the point? Or maybe I'm not different at all, right now I just don't know.Some words that helped guide me then, maybe they'll help me now...The mist hovers low to the groundThick like a layer of soft cottonIt obscures my feetas I trek through the forestI feel the mossy ground give wayas I follow a path cut ages pastGazing side to side I wonderWhy have I not the courage to forge my own?

Long Distance Relationships
Long distance relationships, in a word, suck. Those of you who have went down this road will understand exactly what I mean.
For those of you that haven't, don't enter one lightly. For my part, I am apparently a glutton for punishment as I've been in three.First, a few words on what to expect from them. They are expensive. Whether you're talking phone bills, travel expenses or just added shipping costs if you want to send a gift, they will hit you in your wallet. They play tricks on your mind. This is relative to your personal insecurities, but expect the ones you have to be magnified. All those old sayings like "Out of sight out of mind" and "While the cat's away the mice will play" will start to visit you after a time. We need physical attachment to cement our feelings. It's similar to the way seeing a picture of something (a historical landmark for example) doesn't truly make it real in our minds until we actually have a chance to visit and touch it. Truthfully, there is no logical reason for this, it's all emotional. That doesn't make it wrong or a bad thing, just something that you will have to deal with. Lastly, you need to realize that how you live your life is nothing close to the way it will be if you lived together or even close by (ie a "normal" relationship). You are effectively living your life alone, with some small ties (a phone call, instant messaging, etc). It's not like every other day you'll be visiting, spending the night, seeing their bedtime habits firsthand, or dealing with all their quirks on a regular basis. You are completely insulated from most of what makes living with someone "challenging" (to put it nicely).I was 18 when I got into my first LDR. She had been my first serious girlfriend two years earlier, but it had amounted to nothing more than a summer romance. I don't know why, but I decided to look her up over the holidays (I left a note on her windshield at her parents house). We started to write and fell madly in love with each other once again. Only this time, instead of living across town, she lived four states away in North Carolina. As you can probably guess, it ended much the same way about a year later. I had a couple fun visits and a $2000 phone bill to show for it (ouch!). Still, as with most everything in my life, I wouldn't give up that time for anything.My second LDR was only "part-time". We met in college, so it only became an LDR during the summer months when she went home to live with her parents. In some ways that's better, in some ways it's worse. You get a true attachment going, you're used to them being around. You get to see them regularly, spend all that time together. See them, touch them, hear them, etc. Then poof, you're alone for the next three months. For three years I got to feel that "crash" at the end of every May. Then, I was relegated to letters and the occasional phone call (I learned my lesson from LDR #1) or visit (at the time a three hour drive was not to be taken lightly). This one was rewarded by a twelve year marriage. Yeah, by now it's clicked that I still haveone more LDR to mention... she left me in August 2004. That however, is another story.So now I find myself in yet another LDR. The times have certainly changed from the late 80s early 90s when my other two occurred. Communication is easily the biggest change. It's easier and cheaper to stay in touch. Instant Messaging, cell phones, and online games all combine to eliminate the four digit phone bills I ran up the first two times. She is at least in the same state, but it's still a four hour drive. Now though, I'm at least better able to afford the expense than when I was bussing tables at a family restaurant. Yet even with these "improvements" to make an LDR easier, we still deal with insecurity, we still deal with jealousy. To be honest, I don't think either of them came up nearly as often in my first two LDRs as they have in this one. And of course, nothing can really circumvent that personal experience of being together. We still live our separate lives. We get a glimpse of what being together will be like spending a weekend together here and there, but the reality is that's a drop in the bucket compared to being around each other constantly.Time will tell how things work out. That's become something of a motto for me now. I don't try to foretell my future, and I don't take things for granted anymore. I've learned that nothing in life is certain. All you can really do is treasure the moments you are given, no matter how frustrating they may be. Long Distant Relationships are definitely frustrating. All that having been said, if things don't work out in my current relationship, would I put myself through it all again if I were confronted with LDR #4? Yes. Yes I would. As cynical as I can be at times, the fact is I am a romantic at heart, and I believe love and happiness, the kind that can make you feel fulfilled without reservation, are worth paying any price and overcoming any obstacle for.

The first post
Someone once said that the worst reason to do something, is because a friend asked you to. Personally, I've always felt that is perhaps the best reason. Too often in life, greed and selfishness decide a persons actions. Now before anyone makes any hasty judgements, I am no saint. I have definitely had times when I have given into greed and selfishness. What I do know though, is that I enjoy the feeling I get from doing something for someone else. Once in a while you get lucky enough to end up doing something for yourself at the same time. And so I end up here, starting a blog... because a friend asked me to. She thought I would enjoy it, and I think she may be right.So sit back and relax, take a deep breath, and leave any preconceptions at the door. My ramblings may be introspective, sensual, provocative, downright erotic, or just plain out in left field. Life is all those things and more, and mine is what I'm here to talk about.
