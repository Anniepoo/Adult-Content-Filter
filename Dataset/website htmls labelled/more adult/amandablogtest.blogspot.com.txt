Treats for Amanda, my Stablegirl
Treats for Amanda, my Stablegirl
Thursday, 15 October 2015
"It's all about showing off."
My friend SweetAndyLatex has recently published a stunning new piece of art on his blog showing a feminised but innocently unaware Andy being escorted by his Aunt Jane to a college reunion.
http://smoothslicknshiny.blogspot.co.uk/2015/10/new-art-its-all-about-showing-off.html
I planned to comment on Andy's blog and build on those provided by RubberH and Andy X.  However, I found I ran out of space.  Hence it was easier to transfer them here.
I think that rugby player may have brought his girlfriend Alice along to the reunion.  She remembered Andy and what a sweetie he'd been when they were at college.  She'd always felt a certain attraction towards Andy and wanted to get to know him better but had  never had much opportunity given how the jocks always swarmed around her.  She'd thought he looked nice and was funny from the way he was able to chat happily to the less sporty boys, and was impressed how comfortable and relaxed he was when talking to other girls in their year.
It was a different, less confident Andy that she saw now.  One who looked rather timid if not scared.  An Andy who looked worried about being seen in a new light by colleagues at the Reunion.  But also an Andy who looked totally gorgeous.  He outshone and, in his stunning latex dress, out-glistened any of the other girls at the Reunion.  She could see the boys gazing in awe at Andy as well as at the  attractive, older lady in dinner jacket and tight latex pants holding his arm and escorting   It was unclear between Andy and the lady who was providing the arm candy for whom.  The boys couldn't help staring at the pair together.  They envied Andy for  having a beautiful mature escort and wondered how he had managed to attract such a special lady.  Their minds, like Alice's, were also racing at the thought of their relationship.  It was clear from this evening who was wearing the trousers and was the more dominant.  Andy might be wearing a delicate little collar rather than a necklace but the D-ring at the back was obviously intended for a dog lead attachment.  Andy was clearly either her little puppy or kitten, and  their imaginations were already leaping towards  what might happen in the bedroom.
Alice could see the sporting banter from the jocks clustered round her boyfriend had died away.  Bill's jaw had dropped while his eyes were fixed on Andy.  She could hardly blame him.  She found Andy very attractive too although she also felt strongly drawn to his companion.  If, as seemed likely, the lady was fucking Andy, Alice really wanted some of that too.  Bill was an active and rather powerful lover, but in college she'd had some encounters that often drew her to members of her own sex and their tender attentions.
Andy had relaxed when some of the girls from College started to chat to him.  They were admiring his dress and his make-up.  He looked so toned and pretty.  Andy seemed to relax as soon as the girls started chatting: Alice was struck how he seemed naturally at ease with other girls.   But the boys still hung back.  They were tongue tied and didn't know what to say.  They'd always known Andy was a bit different but had just seen him at school as being lithe and witty.  Seeing him now as the prettiest person in the room was proving an embarrassment for all of them.  How could they respond to someone who'd been their colleague but now was proving to the the real Belle of the Ball and was clearly a hit with their female friends.  Eventually Robin walked across and said hello to Andy.  Andy looked so happy to see Robin.  Robin was slimly built like Andy but Andy towered over him in his heels.  Rather than shake hands Andy bent and kissed Robin on the cheek. Robin blushed slightly but kissed Andy back.  The jocks murmured.  They were so confused.
Alice walked over to Bill who'd been paying her no attention since they'd arrived having settled into drinking with the other jocks and bragging about matches and other players.   She took him by the arm and suggested that he talk to Andy.  She said that she could see  that he was intrigued if not interested by Andy and that she didn't mind if he found Andy pretty.  It was only natural.  To all intents and purposes, she said that he should think of Andy as a girl - maybe he'd even had surgery since  the profile of that figure hugging  latex dress showed no discernible bumps. Either that or Andy knew how to tuck very tightly.  Rather than have any concerns about his own sexuality, he should see it as an opportunity to show how open minded he was.  If the sporting media got to hear about it, he would likely be praised for his openness and panache.  After all rugged was fine, but metro-sexuality and style was  more popular in the media and he'd be far more likely to get modelling or endorsement deals if he was seen to embrace the wider community.  Sneakily she even whispered in his ear how she wondered what a threesome with Andy might be like.   Secretly  Alice was already starting to think not only about a threesome, but more about the possibility of an intimate twosome with Andy's escort.  She was sure an experienced lady like her would now a thing or two about technique that would have a bit more finesse that Bill's clumsy fumblings.
Alice took Bill by the hand and led him across the floor towards Andy.  The crowd of girls parted as Bill and Alice, their former Prom King and Queen, approached.  Alice said hello to Andy and pecked him on the cheek.   Bill tried to shake Andy's hand but Alice told him not to be so silly.  Bill, who was taller than Andy even in his heels, kissed Andy on both cheeks. Although Andy seemed embarrassed, his foundation layered cheeks didn't give away any tell-tale signs but  Bill blushed.  Aunt Jane had a wry smile on her face as Alice said to Bill that since he seemed tongue tied, perhaps he should ask Andy to dance.  They were playing a nice slow number so even he ought to be able to cope with that.  Bill accepted, anything was better than trying to talk to Andy.  To the strains of Phyllis Nelson's "Move Closer", Bill and Andy went out on to the dance floor setting a precedent for others to quickly join them.  Bill felt silly standing apart from Andy for such a number and gradually  the two moved together and soon Bill placed his hands on Andy's slinky waist as they shuffled about the increasingly crowded dance floor.  Andy was extremely shy and stared downwards - anything to avoid eye contact with Bill.  Bill had always been the sports star at the College and it felt strange to be dancing with the guy all the girls in the year had considered to be the biggest hunk.  As they moved closer, first their thighs rubbed together and then as Bill pulled him in more Andy found his waist starting to slide against Bill's crotch.  With dawning awareness,  Andy realised that he was rubbing against something that was becoming increasingly hard and as they turned he glimpsed a discernible bulge in Bill's trousers.  Bill didn't want anyone on the dancefloor seeing so he pulled Andy even closer.  As their hips ground together, Andy wrapped his arms around Bill's neck, while Bill's hands now gripped  tightly round Andy's waist and rested just above that pert shiny bottom.  As Andy felt the little bulge becoming larger and palpably stiff, he could feel Bill's hot breath on his hair and down the back of his neck.  He managed to overcome his shyness and looked upwards.  He was surprised to find a pair of big brown eyes staring down at him.  As he gazed up, his lips parted ever so slightly and whispered "Thank you for dancing with me.  It means so much and Aunt Jane will be pleased with me."  Bill was spellbound as he stared into Andy's limpid pools and driven purely by instinct and animal attraction stooped slightly to kiss Andy full on the lips.  The kiss did not linger and both Bill and Andy recoiled in slight embarrassment.  Andy's mouth opened wide with shock but as he did Bill's mouth descended again and their lips locked together for a slightly more lingering moment.  They drew apart hoping that no-one else on the dancefloor had  noticed.   But those nearby could see that Andy's face was was now resting flat against Bill's chest with a deep smile of happiness and  Bill's hands were grasping Andy's buttock cheeks.  Even though the music had changed to a faster number, Bill and Andy stayed firmly entwined with Andy sinuously sliding his hips against Bill as they gently swayed together.
From the edge of the dance floor, Aunt Jane and Alice watched as the two dancers were increasingly drawn to each other.  Aunt Jane turned to Alice and "Well, it looks like our boyfriends may have abandoned us for a while.   You're Alice aren't you, Andy always told me how you were the prettiest girl in school but he'd never stood  a chance with you  against the big jocks.  I'm so pleased that you seem comfortable with Andy getting to know Bill better.  Perhaps you and I should get better acquainted too. I wonder if I can make amends for Andy's negligence.  Would you like a drink?"

Amber's Dream of Stable Life
Amber dreamed of being kept like this by her Stable Girl.
And being regularly put to the cock, purely for breeding purposes of course, with the Stallion.
With thanks and acknowledgements to Psylocke.

Alice Weiniang Group
Both Andy and I like K-Pop.  In practice, I think this is more for the gorgeousness of many of the girl groups rather than the music although there are some excellent ones like 2NE1 that deserve a global following.   However, in a similar but slightly different vein, I recently came across a Chinese group named Alice.
Alice seem to be either referred to Alice Weiniang Group or Alice Cosplay Group.  "Weiniang" is an anglicised version of  a Chinese word that is itself a translation from the Japanese word 男の娘, which means a man who has a woman's appearance.  I've also seen it translated as a "fake lady" or "cross dresser".
The Alice Weiniang Group is actually a large squad of members based around Wuhan in China.  There are some videos posted on YouTube that you should find if you search for Alice Cosplay.
In the meantime enjoy.  They do look rather sweet.
Good looking candidates for Andy's SlickAir
Could they look more inviting.  Simply gorgeous girls.

Occasional table
As a lover of the work of Allen Jones RA, I thought this web post provided an admirable tribute to his occasional table.
http://theworldofhugoblack.blogspot.co.uk/2015/04/in-need-of-occasional-table.html?zx=ff972b5d6c351a53
It also provides an excuse to post this lovely image of Kate by Jones.

Plugs and Heels
These are my new Ankle boots by Devious.  They are very well made and comfortable to wear.  They have an inside zip so they're easy to put on and fasten so the bondage aspect of the padlocks is a bit of an illusion.  However, a very nice illusion.
The heel height is claimed to be 6 1/4" but in practice it's slightly higher.  I've shown them alongside my plugs to illustrate.
Hope you like.

Back home and back to work
Amanda had loved her stay in Lyon with Sheila and always tried to look perfect for her lover.  Amanda loved the opportunity to dress up especially when they were going out or going to see her former Mistress Gi and her partner P.
It was lovely for Amanda to live with Sheila and share her bedroom if only for a short while.  Amanda felt so comfortable being with her.  She could just relax and be herself.
Amanda also knew that when staying with Gi that she might get the chance to spend some time with P.  Amanda so fondly remembered the times when she used to sit on P's lap when she lived as a maid at Gi's house.   Perhaps P would give her a special treat sometime during her stay.
Amanda had such fond memories of Gi dressing and preparing her for when
her handsome husband got home and then leaving her man and her sissy to
make love.  She knew her husband had needs in the same way that Amanda
did.  Amanda loved those private moments with P who was a tender and
considerate lover.
At times during the visit and being so close to P, Amanda yearned to be filled.   It had been so long since she'd felt her Master's stiff cock inside.  Although she loved Sheila dearly, Amanda still missed having a male lover who would take her and fuck her.  Someone she could submit to and just let their cock slide into her anus.  She remembered when she'd been a maid at a dinner party and P just came to the kitchen.  He'd exercised his droit de seigneur as her Master, bent her over and fucked her there and then. It had been so thrilling to know that the other guests were sat chatting in the dining room while she was wiggling he bottom and satisfying her lover.  Every thrust meant so much to her girlhood.   She could feel his desire for her with every thrust
And now, every time they passed in the corridor, Amanda could still feel that frisson.  She wondered whether he still felt the same about her.  Was the desire still there?  If she just gave the right signals would he pull her panties to one side and fill her in the same way he'd done in the kitchen all those months ago.  She was so confused about what she wanted: she loved Sheila so much.
Back home again, the start of another day at work.    Amanda wondered how Sheila was doing, but also thought wistfully about P and his tender love.   Enough musing.  Time to get dressed and get to work.

Lookalike or the real thing?
Some confusion seems to have arisen about recent photographs of Amanda.  Amanda's lover is convinced that Amanda has been spotted moonlighting in Paris as a certain Keira Louboutin.
Amanda in Paris
Meanwhile Amber is already contemplating what Amanda will look like in a few years.  The answer, of course, is more pretty than ever but you knew already that: a maturing vision of elegance and beauty.
I just see Amanda pursuing a modelling career with this recent attempt at recreating an early Roxy Music album cover on the stable floor.  I'm not sure her Mistress will see this as fitting behaviour for a stablegirl who is meant to be taking care of her ponygirls and ponyboys.
But Mistress could always find ways of chastising Amanda when she returned to the house.
Amanda would realise she was quite cross but was always relieved when she was allowed out in the evening.
Amanda's job in a shop can be quite hard and taxing but there are some rewards when she gets the opportunity to model for clients.

However, my concern is the number of models who now seem to be modelling themselves on Amanda and stealing her look.   Just a small sample is given below.     Now is this Andy modelling a new line in winter coats or Sasha Mikailyan?
Sasha Mikailyan

Amanda looks so windblown, she could be in Portsmouth.  Visiting sailors are often lured into the shop when Amanda helps there by her siren charms and good looks.   They're enticed to  buy for their loved ones although Amanda often helps out when they need to make decisions about what suits them.  Or is that Carolina Monenegro?
Or is that Carolina Monenegro?  No surely it's Amanda.

But Sheila will expect that hair to be better organised, although she found Dimitry Rublyovsky wayward look rather cute and thought it might suit Amanda.

But those eyebrows really needed attention.  Gi would never have allowed Amanda out like that: a trifle too arch

Amanda loved Keira's style but so many others were emulating her look.

But there was a timeless elegance that Amanda knew Keira would carry whilst simultaneously being sweet, seductive and sexy.

Amanda seemed to have entered the craze for taking selfies.  She knew Sheila liked to be kept in touch and an occasional pic would help remind her of the treat in store later that month.

Now it was just a case of wrapping up warm for the journey to France.  Winter in Lyon could be quite cold.

Meanwhile Sheila was already thinking about suitable clothes for Amanda when she arrived.
And if they were going to go out to parties, she'd already got the solution to the lookalike problem.
She'd make sure that Amanda travelled incognito in future.
