A little too close for comfort...
So, mom's house was one of the houses saved from the fire. A big thanks to all the firefighters - the fire reached the front porch, but they saved the house.There are thunderstorms in the forecast though, which could cause extreme flooding, and Mom might have to evacuate again.

And sometimes, you realize what's really important in life.My mom won't know until tomorrow morning if her house is still standing, and my best friend's dad has a 50/50 chance of living through his upcoming bone marrow transplant.And then, you think, maybe my life isn't really that bad.

Holy shit it's ME!
Sooooo.....Yes, I'm still alive. Yes, they've blocked pretty much every site imaginable at work. Oh, and work? Sucks. Big fat ones. But I'm in the midst of fixing that.Anyway, I got shit to do, but I just wanted to leave a little reminder of me... and my little sis who is now the big two-one (we celebrated in Vegas, of course):Oh, and while in Vegas, we went to the fight...and saw Vargas get his ass BEAT:And we basically just drank a lot...and gambled a lot...and somehow I woke up with $400 in my pocket one morning and I didn't even remember gambling. And I bought some super hot shoes.
Yeah, that pretty much covers it.

About Me
Name:
Ali
Location:
So Cal, United States
I am a So Cal girl, and I don't think I could ever live anywhere else. I like to think I'm funny, but it's usually at my own expense. A lot of people think I'm sweet & innocent -- I'll leave that up to you to decide. I always have good
stories the next day. Jumping off piers naked is fun.
I don't blog nearly as much as I used to, now that I actually like my job. Funny how that works.
