me age 13: OMG!!! TEAM EDWARD!!!!! I LOVE TWILIGHT!!! TEAM EDWARD TEAM EDWARD TEAM EDW
me age 16: i fucking hate twilight i never want to see it again get it away from me what the fuck ¬†was wrong with me
me age 18: omg wtf twilight isn‚Äôt so bad but why was i ever team edward he‚Äôs so abusive and controlling jacob is clearly the superior choice for bella i‚Äôm team jacob forever now
me age 20:¬†Jacob Black is the epitome of the ‚Äúnice guy‚Äù who plays heavily into ‚Äúfriendzone‚Äù culture. Bella has, on multiple occasions, told Jacob she has no romantic interest in him yet he continues to peruse her, even forcing himself on her against her will. She punches him after he forces a kiss on her but since he is a werewolf her hand bounces off his face and it‚Äôs laughed off as a joke while Jacob faces no real consequences for his actions. While Edward has exhibited abusive and controlling behavior, he stands in contrast to Jacob. Jacob will not stop pushing Bella to admit she has feeling for him while Edward, with the exception of a few minor incidents, takes the high road and doesn‚Äôt engage in Jacob‚Äôs childish and harmful practices. He does his best to protect Bella from harm and protect her ability to chose a human life or a life with him. What is really interesting is the Team Edward/Team Jacob culture that was perpetuated by this fandom when Bella Swan was the protagonist. Bella was essentially erased from the narrative by fans who wanted her with either Jacob or Edward and her choices were narrowed down to a controlling emo 100 year old vampire or a whiny man child werewolf. I am team Bella Swan and I support her ability to choose the life she wants. (Reference: Meyer, Stephenie. Twilight. , 2005. Print.)
