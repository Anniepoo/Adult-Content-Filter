Random Musings of a Modern Seeker
Random Musings of a Modern Seeker
I always wanted to grow up to be a Muppet. My heroes are Walter E. Disney, Robbert Goddard, Jim Henson and the incomparable S.J. Tucker. Looks like I'm going to be re-blogging photos from other people quite often. If you'd like me to stop, please let me know. If you follow me for long, you'll notice I like bare feet and naked soles. I'm attempting to get more comfortable with and embrace the term fetish. So, I have a foot fetish. But, I love the naked female form in all of it's shapes and sizes. If you are not of legal age to view graphic images or are bothered by them please leave now!

theforgottenlibrary:
The Ghillie Dhu is a guardian of the trees in Scottish mythology. The Ghillie is kind to children, but generally wild and shy. Dark haired, he is particularly fond of birch trees and is most active at night. Ghillies wear clothing made from sewn together leaves and knitted grass and mosses.
(Source and an interesting longer article)
