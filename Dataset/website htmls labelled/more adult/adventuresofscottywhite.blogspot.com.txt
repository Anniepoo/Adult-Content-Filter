Steve's Mom
Scotty drove over to Steve's home, which was a few miles from his own home. It was a Saturday evening and Scotty didn't bother calling Steve to find out if he was home or not. Parking his car and walking up to the door he rang the door bell. A few seconds later Steve's mother answered the door, looking ultra lucious for a forty six year old mother of two children in, both in their twenties. Scotty was lost for words as she stood in front of her. He'd expected Steve to come to the door. Besides Linda looked hot as ever. Of all the occasions that Scotty had seen Linda around the house, this must have been the first time she looked so good.After the usual greetings, Scott asked for Steve. "Unfortunately," she explained, "he's gone shopping with his girlfriend. Would you like to come in for a drink maybe?" she asked. Scott couldn't refuse the offer. Or was it that he couldn't resist the offer made by this wonderful looking older woman. He accepted. Linda turned around, her sweet smelling blond hair in his face as he watched the curves of her ass move up and down as she walked inside. Scotty entered, closing the door behind him.While Scotty sat himself down on the large sofa and made himself comfortable, Linda returned with the drinks, handed one to him and sat down next to him. They started to chat. Scotty's eyes veered from her luscious full breasts to the two inches of naked thigh that rested next to his own leg. He watched and stared at Linda's mouth as she spoke feeling more aroused than he cared to be. A few minutes later, Linda made the first move by touching his knee. Scott knew for sure that this was a sign and made more physical contact with her while he chatted about mundane day-to-day activities. Linda leaned back on the sofa moving her hand up Scotty's leg. He looked down at her hand and then at his swelling crotch and then at her beautiful face and smiled. He leaned over and kissed her on the lips. She responded by thrusting her warm wet tongue in to his mouth and running her hand farther up to feel his swelling cock. They kissed, enjoying each other's mouths, rolling their tongues around each others. Their hands roamed each others bodies.Linda broke the kiss and stood up. For a moment, Scotty thought it was over, that he had over stepped his boundaries. She took his hand and led him up stairs to her bed room. They kissed again, this time more passionately, licking each other's lips and frantically caressing wanting to touch each other's skin. Linda fell in to the bed pulling Scotty down with her. Scotty was on top of her, in between her spread legs, kissing her mouth, her face and her neck. He moved his head downward to her taut breasts. He pulled off her top to reveal a pair of nicely preserved breasts and no bra. He licked them. He tasted them as she moaned with pleasure. He ran his tongue over he nipples and she thrust her hips in to his. He licked her nipples, stopping only to suck them and bite gently on them. Scotty moved further down running his tongue along her stomach and stopping to take off her skirt. Linda was more than happy to take off her skirt and her lace panties along with it. Scotty removed his shirt and pants and got on top of her. He kissed her smooth thighs and and proceeded up ward to lick her wet pussy. She moaned loudly as his tongue came in contact with her clit. He inserted two fingers in to her wet, juicy cunt as he licked her.Linda pressed his head down as he licked her and fucked her with his fingers. She then pushed him over and got on top of him and kissed his mouth. She tasted her juices and licked him around his mouth. She kissed his chest and nibbled on his nipples. She worked her way down to his hard, throbbing cock and took off his boxer shorts. Linda licked his thighs before expertly taking his cock in her mouth. She licked the the wet head and took his entire cock in her mouth. Scott arched his back as he felt pleasure shoot through his body. She took his cock out of her mouth and moved her mouth to his balls. She sucked them one at a time. Her fingers moved under and to his anus. She played with his anus while sucking and licking his balls. Linda took his cock in one hand and thrust it back in to her mouth, inserting a finger in to his anus at the same time. Scott let out a loud moan as he felt tingling all over his body. She sucked him hard, moving her head up and down on his rock hard dick.Lind got up and straddled him, taking his throbbing dick in her wet pussy. She bent over and kissed his lips. Scotty moaned as she sat up and began moving her hips around his cock. She was in heaven as she cocked her head back and scratched his chest. "Fuck me, Scotty!" she cried out as moved her hips faster...Linda got off Scotty and moaned. She inserted two fingers in her cunt and then licked them. She looked straight in to his eyes and said "fuck my ass, baby!". She got on all fours and Scotty positioned himself behind her, applying some lube on his hard dick. She moaned as his manhood entered her anus. "Fuck me! Fuck me! Fuck my ass!" She screamed as he started ramming her up the ass. After a few minutes Scotty came inside her anus like he had never come before. She moaned as she felt his cum inside her. Linda and Scott collapsed on the bed beside each other. Linda ran a hand over his chest and kissed him.

Emily and Andy…
”I couldn’t help but notice how stunning you look. Am Andy Forest and this is my friend Julian” he said slowly letting go of her hand.“Thank you” she blushed. “I’m Emily and those are my friends over there…” she pointed to the table she was sitting.Andy and Emily made small talk for a while and exchanged drinks. Julian walked over to Emily’s friends and started chatting to them. A few hours went by and things became a little physical between the two…Advertisement - Click below to support this siteEmily found herself at Andy’s apartment, sitting on a very comfortable sofa. She had a drink in one hand and sat staring at the painting that hung over the far wall. She was soon joined by Andy who threw his arm around her and started kissing her. Emily almost spilled her drink but couldn’t careless as Andy’s tongue invaded her mouth. She moaned in delight as she felt the wetness of his tongue and felt his warm hand brush over her taut breasts. Automatically her arms went around his neck and she used her fingers to play with the tuft of hair at the back of his neck. Soon they were in his bedroom, getting undressed.Emily looked absolutely beautiful. Her white soft skin was barely visible in the little light that shone through from the bathroom. Andy climbed on top of her and kissed her mouth again. Emily was on fire. Her breathing was erratic and her hand moved over soft skin that covered the hard muscles of Andy’s back. He kissed and licked her ears and neck. She was on fire. He moved his head down to her breasts and licked her hard nipples. She moaned as waves of pleasure rocketed through her entire body. Emily spread her legs and let his body rub against her vagina as he moved around kissing and licking her nipples. Andy licked his way down her abdomen and kissed her waistline. He felt the soft pubic hairs of her cunt on his chin. He moved farther down and licked and kissed the inside of her thighs before inserting two fingers in to her soaking wet pussy. She moaned louder this time as
his penetrating fingers triggered waves of pleasure she hadn’t experienced in a long times. She moved her hips to meet his thrusting fingers. Andy brought his mouth to her clit and licked and sucked on it. Emily was in heaven. She moaned and sighed as her hands played with her hardened nipples.They rolled over and Emily got on top of him, straddling his long, hard cock. She licked his face and moved her own face down, licking his chest and stomach. She licked his balls making him moan. Cupping his balls in one hand, she then took his hard, throbbing cock in her wet mouth. As he felt the warm wetness of her tongue around his hard cock Andy began to moan. He grabbed her hair as her head bobbed up and down on his burning rod. She couldn’t take it any longer and straddled him, taking his cock inside her soaking, dripping wet pussy. She moaned and he almost screamed as she began moving her hips. Andy brought his hands to her buttocks and smacked them as she moved, taking all of his massive cock inside her wet pussy.Andy pushed her over and got on top of her. He entered her vagina with one hard thrust that made her cry out in pleasure. He banged her hard and his thrusts became faster as he approached climax. Just before he came, he took his cock out of her now swollen pussy and came all over her stomach. Emily moaned out loud as she felt the warm liquid on her white, soft stomach. Andy collapsed next to her and she cuddled up to him, resting her head on his sweaty shoulder. Mmm! She moaned as she ran her hand over his chest.

Emily’s first post-Bobby night out
Emily sat in front of her dressing-table and stared in to the mirror. I look good. she decided. She moved closer to the mirror to inspect her eyebrows. Satisfied with what she saw in the mirror, she began applying makeup to her face. A knock on the door, followed by the buzzing sound of the door bell, announced Elizabeth’s arrival. Liz for some reason or the other always knocked first and then rang the bell. Emily could never understand why she did that. “Are you ready?” said Liz walking in to the room“In a bit.”“You look wonderful darling. That top suits you marvelously.”“Thanks love. Be out in a minute.”The two girls would meet the rest of the gang at the pub a little later on. This left the two best friends to engage in a little gossip before heading out. The pub proved to be a little darker than normal. Emily was not thinking of Bobby and she looked around the bar in search of any worthy men. The ladies sat themselves down at one of the tables; one which gave them a panoramic view of the pub. Emily was the first to notice the two young men sitting at the bar and sipping their beers, while they engaged in animated conversation.The gang of girls ordered a bottle of wine with some finger food and indulged in the usual gossip of who was fucking whom. Emily devoted some of her attention to making eye contact with one of the guys who sat at the bar. The man did seem rather interested and kept looking her direction from time to time. Emily felt her heart beat faster as she added more and more wine to her body and anticipated something with the man at the bar. Soon the wine was too much for her bladder to handle and she had to make a trip to the ladies room. Fate had it that she had to make the trip past the two guys sitting at the bar.The man locked eyes with her as she walked past. In the ladies room she sat on the toilet and emptied her bladder. Having had a little too much wine and thoughts of the man she was eying, she extended her left hand rubbed her index finger against her clitoris. She could feel the wetness growing. She rubbed her finger in a circular motion and closed her eyes. Mmm! She let out a moan. Oh! How I wish it was you… On her way back, makeup newly done, brushed past the man and he intern grabbed her arm. The words that came out of his mouth would change the course of events that followed.

Back at Emily's apartment
“Ummm! Good morning, love.” She said turning around and putting her arm around Scotty. He opened his eyes, slowly and turning his head to look at Emily. Her sleepy eyes looked lovely in the morning sunshine seeping through the curtains. He hadn’t felt this way about a girl in a very long time. He felt alive, apart from the rotten fish taste that occupied his mouth. Scott White turned around in Emily Stonebridge’s bed and kissed her lightly on her mouth. Then he looked in to her eyes and ran his hand along her cheek. He smiled. It was perfect; Emily was perfect. He carefully climbed out of bed, like a man freeing himself from a tripwire. Emily pulled the covers up to her head and closed her eyes.That evening….“Hello! Mate!” Bobby heard someone say behind him. He put down the glass of beer and turned around to see who it was.“Hello! Mate, good to see you, didn’t think you would be able to make it, with all that work and all.” He said recognizing his friend.“Well, I couldn’t say no to an old friend now could I? Besides it’s been ages since we’ve met innit?”“Yeah! Grab a seat and let me get you a pint”“Alrighty”Bobby waved to the bartender and gestured for another pint. Eddie received his pint and they toasted to nothing in particular. Bobby was the first to speak.“So how is life? It’s been such a long time since we’ve met”“Yeah! I don’t think I recall the last time we had a pint together. By the way, you were seeing someone weren’t you? What was her name now” he thought for a moment, staring in to his mug as if it would magically reveal the answer he was looking for. “Emily, that’s it. Emily, how is she?””Not seeing her anymore.” Replied Bobby with little emotion.“Oh! Dear, sorry I didn’t know and if I did I wouldn’t have brought it up.”“No. That’s ok. You didn’t know. Well things weren’t going well and we called it off. I spoke to her recently and I think she maybe seeing someone else.”“Oh! Really. Hmm! Well nice to see you are still in touch with her. At least you are friends I guess. So, got anyone new in your life mate?” Eddie took another sip.“Nope. Being single and enjoying it.” Bobby lied.“That’s the way to live mate, I’m telling you. That’s the way.” Eddie smiled. Bobby couldn’t disagree more. This conversation was becoming a little annoying now and
he tried to change the subject.“Oh! I didn’t tell you, I quit my job. I’m looking around for something at the moment.” was all he could think of to change the subject.“Ahh! Moving ahead I see. Very nice. I think my brother-in-law might have something for you. Let me see…” He took out his mobile phone and started pressing a few buttons.A little bit about Bobby and Emily…Bobby Seawell was a middle aged man, sporting day old stubble on his face and always wore an old-looking jacket. He worked for one of those start up internet companies and earned a decent living now, even by London standards. The new flat he’d managed to rent, just south of Victoria allowed him easy access to and from his office premises. With life heading in the right direction, he had met Emily one fine morning on the tube. They talked briefly and Bobby decided to make the tube journey at that very same time everyday. Inevitably they bumped in to each other and they started meeting for coffee and the odd pint after work. Soon the friendship blossomed into a relationship that they both enjoyed. Emily began to notice that Bobby was increasingly like herself and that they shared most of the likes and dislikes. They fell in love.Bobby spent many a weekend with Emily, at her apartment and they both enjoyed the bustling life of London. As time went by, Bobby became increasingly possessive of his love. She had to report to him whenever she went out without his company. Soon, this began to get on her nerves. The proverbial icing on the cake was when he’d casually show up at the places she went, pretending that he was meeting a friend as well. They fought; a lot. Emily was at the end of her tether. She confronted him one evening in her apartment and was shocked to find out that he was convinced that she was seeing someone else. She sat down and told him that perhaps it would be a good idea to take a break.“What? So that you can go gallivanting around with that other chap?” he yelled.“Bobby, there is no other chap. I swear.” She tried not to cry.“Yeah! Right. I’ve heard all about it. And I know, so you can stop pretending now.” He tried to control his welling temper.“I… I swear. I don’t know what I need to do to prove to you that I am not cheating on you.” Tears started to roll down her cheeks.“You… Slut…. How dare you sleep around and lie to my fucking face? How dare you?”“What? How dare you accuse me of sleeping around? I did no such thing. Get out. Bobby, just leave, get out of here” she started to sob.Bobby, enraged by the tone of her voice, slammed his palm in to her face. She collapsed on her sofa and kept sobbing. Get out. I said, get the fuck out of my house she was able to muster. Bobby left. He slammed the door hard behind him. Emily lay down on the sofa and cried. She didn’t get out bed for the next three days, except to use the toilet. Emily’s friends visited her from time to time and she recovered from her state of depression. She began to loathe Bobby. She burned everything that reminded her of him. It gave her pleasure and a sense of freedom as the few artifacts burned to ashes. She would begin a new life. A life free of Bobby and any other Bobbies.
