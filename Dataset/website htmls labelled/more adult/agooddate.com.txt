Request WIP Dean/Zachariah (NC,Pain, generally not niceties) Edit 2
“Ghhk!”Another swing.Another snap of something.The pain was white hot. It burned in his chest. More than any bruise would. His next cough came with a mouthful of blood, and Dean stared at the mess of it on the floor, unable to make the difference between the new batch and the old. Another swish in the air, another impact. His eyes blurred from the pain in his back, and his arms gave out. The captured Winchester, nude as a jay bird and struggling on the floor in front of someone he’d royally pissed off, collapsed in a mess of his own blood, struggling to breathe and with gurgling moans escaping him.“It’s amazing how tough your species are… Like cockroaches.”An expensive shoe pressed down on the side of his neck, and Dean’s breathing got even more ragged, if such a thing was possible. Out of pure survival instinct he gripped and scrabbled at the leg, tried to move it, to get his air back, but the weight only got heavier.“And yet, you push at just the right place and you break like cheap porcelain. Pathetic.”Another few moments of agonizing pain and the feeling that something inside his chest was filling up, and the heavy metal impacted his thigh this time, snapping something important. Dean couldn’t even scream, spitting out more blood and feeling his arms hit the ground, vision beginning to fade to black at the edges.“I can see why your lot like this tool. It’s got a good swing to it. Nice heft… Oh for crying out loud.”A snap of the fingers, and the blood that had been drowning him was gone. The white hot pain of something stabbing into his chest was also gone. The bruises he’d gotten receiving those injuries, however, weren’t. Clearly, neither was the baseball bat, as now it swung down in  golf swing so vicious it’s impact lifted the demon hunter up and threw him into the wall.“Hrrrraaaahh!!”Landing on hands and knees, trembling limbs threatening to drop him again, Dean pushed his head up to try and scowl at the angel he’d pissed off… but he was alone in the abandoned shack. At least, until the familiar trench coat filled his vision, and Dean’s thoughts, which had slowly begun to turn around the idea of how not to feel what was going, bloomed with hope.“C…C-cas! Hrrk… Come on… We have to go before he finds us here… We have to..”The quiet man’s fingers curled in his short hair and gripped. Hard. With a grunt Dean was harshly tugged up to his feet, hands still weak from the beating he’d endured but trying to grip at the angel’s wrist regardless.The scruffy man brought his face in close, their noses almost touching, and before he knew it Dean had a hungry mouth mashing against his own, all teeth and tongue. Part of him panicked. Part him was too hurt to think about it. And part of him moaned fitfully against the angel’s mouth. He wanted to tell Cass to go, to get the hell out of here… but each time he opened his mouth it was plundered and invaded roughly.By the time it stopped and the human was released, falling painfully to his knees, he’d almost forgotten he was covered in bruises and scrapes. And then there was a shoe stepping lightly yet painfully onto his balls, and it was like it had sparked everything else back to life, triggering a wave of nauseating pain all through his being.“Such primitive animals. The mere notion of being controlled and you think it’s time to mate. Being used instead of rescued excited you this much?”Dean looked up at the gravelly voice, feeling too weak to even lift his arms, but instead of the man that sent his insides into a tumbling heat it was one who sent cold daggers in his gut. “You never went away…”Zachariah laughed, and picked up his prisoner by the jaw, lifting him until he was dangling from the portly angel’s grip.“Of course not, you moron. I just pretended to. I didn’t even talk to you, just put on a different skin and you were eating out of my palm. Are you that desperate for any attention, you slut? You wasted no time in accepting what I was doing… It’s just another proof your species belongs on their knees. You’re nothing but bags of hormones and meat.”The angel dropped him and met the falling body with a heavy kick that sent Dean sprawling onto his back, several feet away. He coughed and groaned, panting with effort but unable to even stand. Everything hurt. Everything ached. Even breathing was a chore, but none of that was anywhere near as painful as what he saw coming towards him.Castiel’s angry features bearing down on the nude hunter with a look of disgust and undisguised hatred tore something inside of him. The way he walked, the way he knelt down and cupped Dean’s face… It was undeniably Cass. His every instinct believed in it. Even if he knew better, part of him believed, and that just made it worse.“You listen to one Angel, don’t you, slut. You respect him. Do what he says. Is it just because he satisfies your urges? Your filthy, base needs? Do you know what that looks like to us? Like filthy monkeys tossing their shit.”Leaning down over him, locking both weak arms under a single strong one, the thing that looked like Cass roughly shoved a pair of fingers up inside of the Hunter, wrenching a pained cry from him yet again. “He only indulges you because it’s entertaining. It’s hilarious to watch you humans lose control… it’s like a trained animal doing a trick on command.”He closed his eyes, the sight of Cass’ face snarling those words hurting him more than the scissoring of fingers inside him, but it didn’t help much. He still heard the man’s deep voice hissing in his ear. Still felt the familiar weight against his body crushing down on his bruised and battered flesh. The angel shoved his fingers in harder, making Dean clench up with pain at the horrible intrusion.And still he heard awful words used with Castiel’s voice.“You know, I never understood why you were so special. Why you were the vessel. At least your brother’s got something going for him. He’s a smart kid. Could get along in the world on his own, if he had to. You? You’re weak. You need him. You have to think you’re protecting him, otherwise you’re just a murdering asshole going around the country killing things you don’t agree with. Your actions, your plans, the backlash against what you do every single day… You’re the one who should be locked up, when you think about it.”Just like that, the angel was gone, and Dean wasn’t in an abandoned shack any more. This was… This was a prison cell. Small. Cramped. With great difficulty, the hunter managed to roll himself onto his stomach, gasping in the pain the effort took. Every heart beat, every little twitch of movement of a leg sent lances through him.“What… the hell?”And then the sound of bars swinging open made him realize he was still very, very naked. Whoever was coming didn’t give him time to turn around, a heavy boot slamming into his back and shoving him against a wall. Normally he’d turn and swing at the fucker, but Dean’s vision was blurring from pain. The blow had jostled all sorts of almost breaks and near tears inside of him, and he stood against the wall, panting and trying to keep himself from breaking down.And then whoever had kicked him was pressing up against him, pinning him against the wall. He tried to fight, tried kicking, tried hitting the man with his elbows, but all that got him was to have sure fingers snap both of his wrists into painfully tight cuffs, the metal biting deep into his skin. The chain had even been wrapped around one of the bars of the window above him, keeping his arms from being able to protect him. A theory which was tested when a fist drove the air out of him, slamming into his liver and making Dean cough up more blood.“I’m glad they could drag you down here, Winchester. You’d be surprised how angry you get when it’s one person’s fault you get your ass blown up. Painfully.”Dean froze, or at least until something hard and unyielding, a nightstick, whacked into his other side. “Ggrraahahh! s..Stop… Leave Henriksen out of this…” he panted, slumping and feeling his weight force the cuffs to dig harder into his flesh. He barely noticed, not when the nightstick slammed down between his shoulder blades and brought another cry of pain from him.“Leave me out of it, Winchester? Why didn’t -you- leave me out of it, huh? Why didn’t you save me from that psychotic bitch? Why’d you leave me to get the skin literally flayed from my bones?”“Please… We didn’t.. Hrrrk! We didn’t know! Ggggkk…”The nightstick. The detective’s fist. His knee. Dean shuddered and jumped each time a blow struck home, spitting up enough blood to paint the wall in front of him. By now he was trying to curl up, but he had no where near the amount of strength he needed just to keep standing instead of dangling like a piece of meat.“But you know what’s worse than getting killed, you sanctimonious selfish asshole? You know what’s worse than getting slain just for ending up between your stupid brother’s war and the other side?”Hendrikson’s teeth were right up against Dean’s ear, his heavy breathing sounding loud and almost animal like. The hard rubber of the nightstick was tapped against Dean’s ribs. His thigh. His exposed cheek. And then it was being pressed in between and up against his already torn and bleeding hole. Twisted and wedged in like a square peg in a round hole. It made the bound man cry out, which got him another fist in the liver before the nightstick was twisted, forced deeper.“Those demons, they weren’t satisfied just killing us, you see. Made em Excited. They wanted to have Fun. All because you boys couldn’t deal with your issues without bringing the world down on the rest of us.”Dean’s breathing was ragged, coming in quickly as he tried and tried to push everything away, but he couldn’t ignore the pain. Couldn’t ignore the constant reminder slamming up inside him, the stick slick with his own blood as it was pushed in and out roughly. Couldn’t ignore the blows the angel rained down on him while wearing the form of one of his biggest failures.“Oh no, Winchester. You don’t get to ignore me. You don’t get to pretend I don’t exist and leave me behind, like when you got me killed. You’re going to focus on me. And remember me. And every second of the next few hours.”And Dean did.His screams only lasted ten minutes, his throat sore and unable to work the noises.Henriksen’s voice worked without problem for the entire six hours, only slowing down whenever he needed to pinch something in Dean’s neck and force him awake whenever the pain had him black out.By the time Dean blacked out, he was completely limp, hanging from the cuffs. Couldn’t even flinch at the heavy slap on his ass. Couldn’t stop his body’s spasming twitching around the black rubber jammed deep inside, against his prostate. He could feel the blood run down the stick and drip down against his ankles. Could feel the cuffs digging into his wrists, the bleeding from them staining his arms and back. And then there were more footsteps. “H-hey, I don’t know what your deal is, Zach, but you’re not going to make it any worse..” he managed to rasp out, coughing more crimson against the stained prison wall. He was just… He was just so tired. This was just Alistair all over again, and he had to wall everything off. Don’t let anything affect him… “Giving up already? I didn’t raise you to be such a quitter.”Dean’s eyes snapped open, his heart beating even faster. “No no no nononononono you sick fuck leave him outta this!”His renewed struggles only served to hurt his wrists more and remind him he couldn’t even stand under his own strength. Which made the strong, calloused hand landing on his shoulder even worse. “You’re weak. You’re nothing but a blunt instrument and you couldn’t even do that right… I mean my God, Dean, did I really give up my soul for you? Look at you now… what a fucking waste.”He knew it wasn’t real. Knew it was just an imitation… but the words still cut deep, dredging up doubts he’d long locked away. And then those heavy knuckles slammed into his cracked ribs, making him cry out even louder. “Pathetic. I thought I taught you how to take a punch, boy.”Another hit. Another. And then just as Dean managed to brace himself for an impact, he was instead spun about, arms twisting painfully in the cuffs above. His gasping, tear streaked face was met with a hateful wad of spit, the eyes of his own father looking down on him with disgust. It was such a shocking sight to him he couldn’t even understand the new sensation for a while, until he felt the rubber move up and down inside of him. His father was jerking him off, and worse, he was hard as a fucking rock. “Don’t… ng.g.. Fuck.. please!”“What’s the matter, slut? Open up for everyone else and can’t even give me the time of day?”The older man fished his own hardening shaft out of his fly, pressing the thickening flesh against Dean’s own, dwarfing it by an inch or more. The derisive chuckle said it all, and it bit at the bound hunter deeply, cutting at a confidence he’d always held close. “I suppose I shouldn’t be expecting much more…. at least you’re useful for one thing..”That was his only warning before the thing wearing John’s face shoved it’s cock up against the blood splattered nightstick, forcing the already ruined hole even wider as he continued to stroke. Dean tried to fight it, but his legs were easily hefted to lazily wrap around the other man’s hips. His whole body bounced with the rough treatment, shoved up and down on the thick shaft inside of him, jostling the stick held deep and making him see stars. The pain and the heat in his gut fought for his attention, tugging on his fraying consciousness until they blended in one unending nightmare of sensation, his bruised and battered balls pulling up and spilling their load all over the other’s fingers. Too quickly that dirty hand was smeared in his face, wiping up the mess on his lips, in his hair. “Can’t even control yourself for a minute? You really are a slut for anyone who’ll take your ass… Starting to doubt you’re even mine, what a pathetic bitch.”

Request: Cashing in - Potts/Stark, Pegging, findomme, denial
“Do you like it? It’s a bit bigger than my last one… I thought I’d call it ‘Thor’, since I knew you’d like that.”Breathing deep in an effort to hide the shudder of desire that ran through him, genius billionaire playboy philanthropist Tony Stark had to admit the name did bring some rather interesting thoughts to mind. Especially once Pepper began rolling her hips, the motion sliding the thick, heavy shaft back and forth along the crease of his exposed ass.“Not that I don’t uh… enjoy these little escapades, Ms Potts, but to what do I owe the pleasure? You don’t usually visit my lab in the middle of the day like this…”Slender fingers entwined in his hair, gripping hard and tugging him back. Reflexively he tugged at the restraints on his wrists, the heavy iron man gauntlets still held by various mechanical arms. Pepper had told Jarvis to keep him in place, and although the more than a program less than an AI was supposed to listen to him above others, apparently it had a soft spot for Ms Potts.Trapped and half suited in his armor, Tony tested his legs. Both of them were still anchored firmly in either boot, which themselves were sunken into the changing platform. His body was bent at the waist at a square angle, his weight supported by his armor’s chest piece and a few more mechanical arms. The back plate hadn’t been attached, and now he felt the authoritative red-head lean down on him, her weight pressing that thick toy up against him even harder.“Oh, just wanted to test my new toy. Jarvis took his sweet time designing it, you know. Vibration, self lubrication, electrostimulation, all the bells and whistles…”Lips teased at his ear, tugging on his lobe before she nibbled along his neck, and Tony felt himself tense even more. His eyes closed half way, and most of his boy felt limp. When she teased him like this, when she locked him down… It was better than any drink and twice as effective.“Oh, and I wanted to discuss some business with you. Just a few… clerical errors, I’m sure.”Eyes going wide as saucers, the always confident Stark bit his lip.“Y-yeah? I don’t see why you’d want that, I’m just… I’m just a handsome, charismatic scientist now, Pepper. That’s why you’re the CEO, so I don’t have to deal with that stuff…”The tugging on his hair got harder, fiercer, but Pepper’s voice was silk.“Oh don’t worry, it’s not company money I want to discuss…”Tony suddenly wished his jeans and boxers weren’t pools around his ankles and shins. That way, maybe she’d miss how hard he was. Maybe she’d miss the way he was bobbing, the way every beat of his heart sent a shiver through him.“Did you think I wouldn’t see the cheat, Tony?”Well kept nails dragged down the back of his head, scratched a quintet of angry red lines across his back, and continued over his hip until they were holding his very, very stiff cock.Pepper’s voice got even quieter.“I think you need some punishment for that, boy…”Slowly, achingly slowly, those fingers moved back and forth. A very slow, methodical rhythm. Certainly nothing that would get him even close to completion, but easily enough to stimulate and drive him mad.And there was the pressure against his ass, too. With a shift of her hips Pepper had repositioned the strap-on, pushing the smooth head against his tight ring of muscle. She didn’t thrust. Didn’t shove, or push. Just allowed her weight to slowly, inexorably press down on him. Let the toy’s slick surface (had it been wet earlier? It felt positively drenched…) and curiously shifting surface open him up.It slid home much more easily than he thought it should, a testament to how often they’d played with the last model, but the thickness of it made him see stars. It was just on the edge of pain. He tried to control his breathing, to think of anything but the grip on his dick and the way Pepper was setting him on fire with desire. The way her voice sent electric currents up his spine. The way the touch of her lips against his ear, against his neck whenever she spoke made him want to groan for more.“Who gave you the money, Tony?”Some people assumed Tony Stark had trouble giving up power. He didn’t have that much issue with it, because in almost any fallout he still had access to one of the world’s largest fortunes to get back in the game. It was like the ultimate safety net.Which was why he’d asked Pepper (in a confident and charming manner, not a stammering, nervous one, of course) to take it away, once they’d gone this deep in their relationship.“B…Barton. He’s a terrible poker player. Can’t bluff.”Those fingers squeezed a bit harder. The thick mass inside of him pushed deeper.Lord how far would it go?“Don’t lie, Tony, I’ve seen you play cards… It’s not your strong point.”You couldn’t do with just five thousand a month when you hung out with his crowd… He’d only overdrafted the credit card a little, and a little loan from an all too pleased Hawkeye had been supposed to hide that fact.“F-fine, you got meeeeEEEaAAAnnghg..”Pepper let out a little cooing noise of approval at his sudden discomfort, the heavy shaft inside of him pressing against his prostate. Hard. It pushed past it a little, and then moved back. She was pulling it out, forcing his body to tug and grip at the thick shaft with an intensity that left Tony reeling.“Good Boy.”She punctuated the shiver inducing praise with a roll of her hips that sent the behemoth back inside of him. Still not quite a 'thrust’, more like a slow, careful wave. Again it scraped against that sensitive nut inside him, pushing past it and feeling like every extra inch scraped it raw, and then rolled back. A smooth motion that repeated itself, over and over. Back and forth. Like the sea.“You’re going to pay him back this weekend, Tony.” she began, letting go of his twitching cock before the eager length could make a mess. It was all so fast, but the futurist could feel the heat coiling in his gut. He wouldn’t be long.“You can use your corporate card for the rest of the month… we’ll deduct it from next month’s allowance.”Her hips moved to push against his own again.Tony moaned.Never in his life had anyone had this much control over him. The final say of his finances, that which defined him to most of the world. As far as he knew, Pepper didn’t particularly enjoy being a financial domme to fulfill his deep fantasies… but she certainly liked playing with the mewling mess it turned him into.“Please Pepper…”Teeth bit into his shoulder, drawing a gasp. Fingers tugged on his aching cock, pulling it down… and then there was a click, and the ring of plastic around his package made him whimper.“Remember Tony, use your words.”This time the return of the giant shaft inside of him was a full on thrust. A heavy motion that rocked him against his bonds, the pressure of it causing black spots to crowd his vision. The pulling away was a much slower affair that left him feeling empty before it was replaced with another harsh pounding motion that slammed into his prostate.“M…Ms Potts!” he whimpered, feeling his cock jostled back and forth from the weight of her thrusts.“That’s better. Now, we’ve discussed the restoration, but not the actual punishment… Jarvis? Can you pull up what I showed you earlier?”In front of Tony’s eyes, a pair of holograms appeared, the both of them floating at his eye level. The first was Pepper wearing a blood-red evening gown. It had a slit up to her hip running on one side, and the holo Pepper clearly enjoyed showing off the way it exposed her leg. The thin straps did little to hide her shoulders, and the open toed heels completed the frisky ensemble.The second was Pepper in a different dress, this one black and completely open at the back. It’s cleavage ran low enough to make him blush and the stiletto heels were even higher and more pointed than the previous pair.Tony swallowed, mouth dry.“Which do you prefer, Tony?”Licking his lips and only barely managing to stop the grunt of pleasure from the next thrust of Pepper’s weight against him, the inventor had to try three times before desperate moans became proper words.“I… I can’t pick… nghg…”“Congrats then, Tony, you’ve just bought both of them. Thank you, I’ll just deduct that from next month’s allowance…”His protests were cut short with another heavy pounding of his prostate, Tony closing his eyes. He was so close… He could even feel the tightness of the ring hold him back, could feel the droplet of precum that had managed to force its way out of his swollen tip.“You can always ask Nat nicely… if you convince her to ask me I might be nice and give you some extra next month…”Just the thought made Tony groan, memories flashing back to the last time he’d had to submit himself to that particular ritual. He hadn’t sat still for a month…His thoughts were dragged back to the present by the hot panting against his ear, the puffs of breath signalling just how close Pepper was getting.“Mmnhg… Almost there, Baby… Almost…”Last time, she’d gone through four , maybe six before slowing down.The friction inside of him burned and ached and made him want to beg, but he resolutely tried to keep his mouth shut.The ring felt stifling.“Time to test that shock function, I think…”

Request: Learning from History – Ultron/Steve (Ultramerica?), Humiliation, verbal/physical abuse, Masochism.
Written at a Friend’s request and based off an idea I’ve had bouncing about lately. (No spoilers for Avengers 2)Thrown into the large, empty room, the soldier hopped to his feet the moment he touched the ground. Within seconds he was already jumping at the eight foot tall robot, despite all evidence in the past few hours that he clearly wasn’t a match. This time what stopped him wasn’t a kick or a punch from the towering egomaniac, but a simple, well placed grab for his neck. Ultron lifted its new captive by the choke hold, forcing Steve to scrabble for a grip on its arm and hand just to give himself room to breathe.“Oh Captain my captain.” the artificial creature said quietly, amusement evident in its eyes, “I do enjoy seeing you struggle. It’s a reminder of how easily I could kill you, you see. It does, however, get tedious having to beat you down every ten minutes or so.”The metal man had done just that, pausing in its flight path each time Steve would regain consciousness, beating him just enough until he was too woozy and hurt to keep fighting. It never lasted. Even now, Steve was starting to be able to open his swollen right eye, and the cut on his lip had healed over. Underneath the armor he was certain every inch of him was bruised or cracked , and it only got worse once he was thrown clear across the room, slamming into the metal wall with a dull thud and hitting the floor quickly after.Spreading its arms wide and closing the only door of the circular room with a nod of its head, Ultron began pacing in a slow circle.“Do you like it? I’ve designed this room just for you. Titanium alloy for the walls and door, no corners anywhere, even the meeting of the wall and floor and ceiling are rounded off. You can’t get a solid grip on anything around. It’s just one big empty room, you, and me.”Struggling to stand and needing to lean against the smooth wall just to manage that, the gasping super soldier shook his head to try to clear his vision of the worrisome, blurry haze. “Why… Why me?”Ultron stopped where it stood, slowly turning towards its captive. “Ah… Why indeed?”The mechanical man took its time walking towards the confused Steve Rogers, even as the latter did his very best to put up a fighting pose.“I’ve been studying you all, you see. They say to know your enemy is to defeat them, and all that. Problem is, every one of you is so…”The towering menace paused a moment, lost in thought. Steve gritted his teeth, recognizing his moment, and dove, trying to get behind it.“Ah yes, that’s right.”One large leg swung up faster than Steve could react, driving the air from his lungs as the metal shin slammed into his stomach.“Predictable. Boring.”The blow sent him flying back several feet, hitting into the wall with an impact that would have likely killed a normal man. Powerful vibranium fingers closed around the Captain’s throat, lifting him back up and slamming him against the wall hard enough to force a blood spattering cough from him.“You’re the most interesting one, you see. And besides. You’re… Durable.”Swung over Ultron’s body with ease, Steve cried out when his back hit the floor, barely conscious enough to pay attention to the heavy footsteps coming towards him.“I know that so long as I’m careful, I won’t break you. At least not immediately. I’ll have time to adjust.”Another kick, weaker than before but still strong enough to send him a few feet away and a foot off the ground, left Steve clutching at his stomach. The super soldier was still struggling for breath by the time Ultron nudged him onto his back with one foot.“What…Hhhgg.. What makes me so interesting?”Slowly, almost delicately, the large robot placed one large metallic foot on the man’s chest, pressing down just enough to make each breath a hard-fought battle. Steve was sure he heard something crack, but he was too tired to force the other off of him. Even with both hands clutching desperately at Ultron’s ankle, he couldn’t fight the pressure on him.The mechanical menace leaned down until its face was only a few inches from the battered soldier’s own. It smiled, nodding as if to an unasked question.“Captain America. Mister Perfect Soldier. The Best and Greatest of them. The Role Model.”Ultron didn’t even flinch at the attempted punch. Still wheezing for breath under its foot, Steve’s blow barely moved it. Instead he was rewarded with an ache in his knuckles, and an increase in the pressure on his chest. Now he definitively heard something crack.“See, the others either use the internet so much it’s a chore to go through what they look at, or are so predictable and boring it’s not worth the effort.”Wide eyes and red cheeks, well, as wide as one black and swollen one could go at least, confirmed to the robot that it was on the right track.“That’s right. Every page. Frequency of visits. Bookmarks. I even have the security footage over the last year of you making use of those pages in your room… Oh, you didn’t know? Every room in that tower’s got constant surveillance going on…”The pressure on his chest let up for just an instant, and Steve took several gasping breaths, too shocked to try to fight his way out. Then the weight was back, and he was grimacing with the effort to keep from having his chest get crushed. Large, metal digits moved down to sweep his hair away from his eyes, the strands matted with sweat.“Staying silent, are you? Well, if you’re going to be my new pet, that’s right, you’re a pet, not a guest. Inferior life forms are always pets, not equals. If you’re going to be my new pet, I thought I’d look at what you do in your free time… How to entertain yourself. You and I are going to have a lot of fun, Captain.”With a primal cry of effort, the soldier managed to lift Ultron’s foot by an inch. Two inches. Three. “What I do behind closed doors is none of your… Rrraahhh!! Bus…inesss!”With an annoyed huff and a roll of the eyes the heavy vibranium boot forced its way back down, pressing on the soldier’s chest hard.“Let’s go through this list of yours, shall we mister Perfect Soldier? Oh, this one is about boot licking… I don’t exactly have boots but I think we’ll make do. This one has chains and multiple assailants… you -do- have a dark side, you dirty little slut. You like that? It shows up in most of your favourites… in fact, I can see your skin heating up right now. Getting excited, Captain? That won’t do… I’m the enemy, aren’t I? Shouldn’t you be all stoic as a prisoner of war? Speaking of which, that’s the name of the one you visit the most, isn’t it? Let’s see… Oh, such depravity..“The more Ultron spoke, the redder Steve’s face became, the perfect soldier trying very hard to ignore how his body betrayed him hearing those words. How his own little soldier certainly stood at attention. It took so much of his focus he was entirely surprised when his body armor was simply ripped from either side of him, leaving his upper body mostly bare.Exposed.“Dirty cum whore.” came the whispered voice, the robot leaning so far down its mouth was inches away from Steve’s ear.“I can see the common thread in all those stories and videos you keep going back to, cock slut. I can make the link between them and how you hold yourself when you play with yourself, desperate and needy. You’re aching for someone to put you in your place, aren’t you, little army bitch? Wish you had a whole barrack’s worth of men to spit and mock you while they filled each of your holes over and over again, don’t you?”Trying to turn his head away, Steve’s grunted denial was much less enthusiastic than it had been before. He still fought to get out from underneath the eight foot tall metal giant, but he was… distracted. Especially when the heavy being started laughing.“So easy… I haven’t even begun experimenting with pheromones and drugs in the air and you’re already becoming undone at the thought of being my little slut toy. Don’t worry, I’ll arrange for some of your fantasies to come true… After all, it would be child’s play to hire a mercenary corps to turn you into a dripping mess, wouldn’t it?”Another helpless swing of a weak fist, and this time the robot did move. Not from the blow, however. Instead it lowered itself to one knee, pressing it down on Steve’s chest while its heavy foot rubbed and shifted against his crotch, making the First Avenger groan in indignant discomfort.“First, however, I should take a measure of you… Just how many times are you going to make a mess, Rogers? Don’t worry, if you’re a good little cockslut, I’ll let you clean it all off my foot with your tongue… Won’t that be nice?”

“Thought you could get close to her, did you, filthy pig?”I coughed when the heavy fist landed in my stomach. The way he pushed his weight against me, twisting his hand against my bruised ribs, sent me swinging away a few feet before gravity took hold again. On the back down I was met with another blow, this time on my face.My head was knocked to the side so hard I was certain something must have torn, but I could still feel everything in painful detail so I doubt I was lucky enough for that to happen. The last hit had split my lip again, and my tongue was covered in the tangy, metallic taste of my own blood for the… honestly I had no idea how many times it had been.“Fucking maggot… No one touches her, you hear? No one!”This one was behind me, and instead of hitting me like his friend, he seemed to enjoy carving me up like a turkey. Another slice, this one along my shoulder, and it was deep enough I could immediately feel the blood drip down my arm, joining with the rivulets from countless other cuts already.“Our Goddess is pure and holy, and you… you Trick and Seduce her… You’re trying to make her fall from grace, you devil!”What felt like an army issued boot slammed into my left side, turning my swaying motion into more of a left to right motion while I was busy coughing up blood. Had something cracked? I just had to. Breathing was hard. I could barely move my lips without cracking open a half healed wound and finding myself exploring the taste of my own blood again.You’d think that would make sticking your foot in your mouth a lot harder.But hey, I have a knack.“If winking an eye her way’s the only thing I need to seduce her, sorry to tell you bub, your Princess ain’t so pure.”Predictably, that knack earned me another flurry of blows. Two of them started on me, aiming at my ribs and stomach, liver blows worthy of professional boxers. By the time they let up I felt like dying. I was wheezing for breath that I couldn’t seem to pull in, and consciousness was pretty hard to keep going.So I opened my mouth again.What can I say?“You guys… Hrk… done tickling me down there..? ”Evidently, only the worst of things.I somehow found the breath to scream when a blade was jammed into my arm, my entire body seizing up in reflex and just making everything worse.“Oh you think that hurts, Heathen?”I… I did not like the sound of that. Not one bit. In all honestly, I was only half certain that’s what he’d said, blinding pain and all, but given my situation it was probably a safe bet.Suddenly, the tangy scent of citrus hit my nose through the smell of my own blood and the dirt and grime they’d dragged me through to get me hanging from the rafters like this… and I winced.They sure as hell weren’t going to be making lemonade.“That’s right, Seducer. You’ll be begging for us to let you go before we’re done with you for even thinking of approaching our Queen. ”I wasn’t even halfway started on my brilliant come back of “I’ve been asking you that for hours now” when I felt the first dash of cool liquid land on a cut above my collarbone.It hurt.A lot.In fact, it hurt so much I’m pretty sure at the time I would have sworn it hurt more than the actual cutting had. It got worse still when thick clumsy fingers pressed in on the wound, spreading the acidic juice about and making every bit of it burn like it was on fire.Satisfied that I was screaming myself hoarse in pain just from that demonstration, they left me for a few moments, hanging and shaking and trying to stop the pained scream whenever one prodded at one of my cuts with a juice covered finger.And then they just splashed me. I don’t know if they’d hand pressed lemons to fill a bucket or just bought some lemonade, but suddenly every inch of me was drenched. Every cut , bruise and scrape was on fire, from the ones on my back, to my arms, to the ones down on my thighs, my belly, even the ones on my face were given attention.I screamed, I thrashed, probably only making things worse, but I couldn’t stop myself. Everything was on fire, and it felt like countless tendrils of pure agony were worming their way inside of me from cuts and wounds so numerous I had stopped noticing the pain from half.And then my world went white when the contacts of the taser touched my hip. I seized up, my entire body twitching uncontrollably, and felt even more pain once the awful device was pressed against one of my more recent cuts. The lemon and blood seemed to carry the lance of pain deep inside of me, making it feel like I’d explode from so much inside of me…But of course I didn’t even lose consciousness.Sometimes the world sucks like that.“We’ll see how willing you are to tempt and seduce once your balls taste some voltage…”

Alphabet April: Y - Yarn, Why, Yes, Yours
The room is quiet.Enough that I hear everything.The faint rustle of paper when she leans forward and changes the page.The clicking of the needles with every motion of her fingers.The little huff of air that means she just had to stifle a snort of laughter.The cluck of her tongue when she misses a motion and needs to undo some of her work in order to continue.The light sound of drops of sweat, infrequent but getting more and more numerous, hitting the tiled floor with tiny little pops.I try to concentrate on the sound of her breathing, to imagine her expression as she reads her book and absent-mindedly continues to knit.I try to ignore the light chaffing as the yarn is tugged against my skin, the strand loosely passing around my balls an under my hanging cock before going up near the crack of my rear and to her needles. It’s like a constantly moving, never-ending wedgie, but I don’t complain.Instead I strain to control my breathing as my arms and legs tire of holding up her weight, wincing whenever she leans to one side or the next. He motions to flip a page, or take a drink of water, are torture for me, every muscle in my body screaming at me to simply allow myself to drop against the ground.I wouldn’t even get in trouble, I know.“Make sure you tell me when you’re at your limit.” she told me.Hell, pushing this hard will probably get me in trouble.But I don’t want the burning strain to go away. I don’t want her to worry and fuss over me. (Well okay, I do a little, I would never turn down an excuse to have those lovely hands of hers on me.) I want to prove I can do this as long as she needs to.One of my arms almost gives out, but I steady it before I drop more than half an inch.She stops, placing a hand on the back of my neck, but I don’t reply. I don’t ask for anything, I don’t complain.Either she believes me, or she understands the effort I’m putting in and respects it enough to give me the small victory, because I hear the needles start up again.I don’t know how long it continues, or even if I was fully conscious the whole time. Parts of the afternoon grew hazy, the pain in my body turning to a dull, background ache.By the time I come back, it’s to fingers snapping right in front of my eyes.I’m still in the same position, but now she’s sitting on the bed just in front of me.I feel ashamed that I couldn’t hold her up the entire time, but just as I feel my mood drop, she smiles. Now that she sees my expression, knows I’m paying attention, she lifts something up so I can see it.It’s a tuque.She places the completed hat on my head, fussing with the sides to make sure the warm wool covered my ears properly, and then leaned back, admiring her work.“Thanks for letting me finish.” she says, making my heart swell.And that’s when I notice she’s removed her leggings. She spreads her thighs, showing me a sight fit to make my mouth water, and…“Come on, Boy. Time for your reward.”“Why? I…”“You’ve earned it. Besides, a girl has needs.” she giggles.Her expression darkens just a little, and the hands that pulled me towards her move to petting and caressing my face once I’m inches away from the prize.“My turn. Why?”“I’m… I’m yours.”“Mm… Good Boy.”

Alphabet April: X - Extra Large, Xenobiology, x-rated
Tossed into the dark cavern without any clothing, the young man landed in a heap, rocks and hard dirt scraping him. By the time he’d scrambled to his feet the only exit had already been sealed by a heavy boulder he knew he wouldn’t be able to shove on his own.The room was dimly lit by lamps installed at various intervals in the ground itself, and he could see the glint of camera lenses up in the corners of the dark cavern. Of course. They’d told him what he needed to do to get out , after all. Even suggested that it might be better for his health.And when he saw the massive shape against the wall shudder and rise, he understood why.As the creature stepped closer and into the light, it clearly towered over eight feet tall. It’s limbs were long, but thin, at least in comparison. Clearly well muscled, but tightly packed. Wiry. It’s steps had a swaying motion to it, the almost feline looking beast shifting left and right as it got closer. It was hard to gauge distance, really. Some steps seemed to take it further than others. And then it stood still.And suddenly it’s cat-like nose was pressed against his own.“So you’re the new one, then?” it hissed, sounding much too pleased for him to relax in any way.The white fur covering its body had more than a few splatters of dark red blood on it, after all. Some were old, some were recent.He didn’t get to answer.A four-fingered hand landed on his shoulder with bruising force, pushing him down onto his knees with little effort, if any at all. The creature didn’t seem to care whether or not he wanted to cooperate, instead just wrapping its hand around the top of his scalp and tugging him between its thighs.The thick club swaying there was easily bigger than his arm, and was devoid of fur. Hesitantly, he placed a hand on it, and the material seemed to give a little. Like it was inflated but not quite solid. That was about all the thinking he had a chance to do on the matter, however, as the strong beast dragged him in further. Once his face was pressed up against it and those powerful hips began grinding against his features, he was more certain. There was a solid…. core inside the organ, about three inches thick and over a foot long, but the rest was… what?It certainly smelled sweet, in any case. Almost sickly so. Each breath warmed his entire being, even as he pushed out his tongue to try to lick at the smooth skin pressed against him. Almost immediately his captor shuddered and groaned, pulling his head away just far enough for him to see what he’d assumed was an analogue for a dick unfurl and bloom like a flower. Six petals, previously arranged in a spiraling tower, spread open now, revealing a smaller yet still formidable rod that glistened with… If the rest was a flower, this was certainly the nectar.The sticky looking liquid was everywhere inside the petals, strands of it stretching out and snapping as each bit of protection spread out wide. The entirety of the shaft, barely visible in the low light, seemed to drip and ooze the substance, and the sweet smell tripled immediately. It was so thick he was certain he’d choke on it if he opened his mouth.And then the creature forced him down harder, jamming the soft yet unyielding rod against his lips. He opened his mouth to curse, on reflex, and found the spongy tower driven into him. It pushed deep, blocking his throat easily and diving in, forcing him to gag on the intruder and struggle, banging on the powerful thighs just next to his head.The struggling was short-lived.The moment his panicking tongue touched the slimy nectar, the young man’s eyes rolled upwards. The shock of lightning going down his spine and into his gut would have left him breathless even if he’d had the opportunity, and every moment his skin felt like it could feel thousands of things it had never noticed before.His gagging stopped , but his lungs still burned. His throat relaxed around the intruder, and he was pushed away and allowed a single, gulping breath before he was impaled on the shaft yet again. The more he tasted the beast’s slime, the more desperately he tried for more. Scrambled to press himself further in, to take in more, much to the shuddering and groaning creature’s pleasure.“Hmmm… Get it all ready for the real breeding, Pet… I want to give your captors a real show …”

The thin, smooth material flew through the air yet again. A coil caused by the motion of a wrist slid its way along across the length, unfurling with a speed to cause a pop in the air just as the edge landed against oiled skin.The red mark joined multiple others, criss-crossing over the glistening, tanned surface of the bound man’s skin. Kneeling and wearing nothing above his belt, the young man’s back rippled with the effort to move away from the pain inducing lash. With how tightly his arms were tied to the posts on either side, however, keeping his arms up and stretched out, he didn’t have much of a choice in the matter.He struggled to say something around the plastic ring keeping his pretty mouth open, but his handler clearly didn’t mind. Another flick of the wrist, another lovely red line appearing on his thigh. Another strangled moan of pain wrenched from his throat.“You know the rules, Pet. No noise, no squirming. It doesn’t count, otherwise. We’re still on number… oh what was it… Three? It’s been over two hours and we’re still at three. If you won’t control yourself we’ll make finish your fifteen.”The words were spoken like it was his fault that each time the whip cracked, he immediately shook in his bonds in an attempt to get away. Like it was his fault that his throat was becoming hoarse from screaming. That only three of the lashes so far had counted. Only now, after such a long time, another issue was presenting itself.He didn’t want to even imagine it, but… he really needed to go. Bad. Now his squirming was for an entirely different reason, clenching his thighs together despite how uncomfortable the too tight daisy dukes made the motion.He was met with another lash across his lower back, his handler asking what was wrong. Of course, he couldn’t answer, though from the other’s peels of laughter it was evident the motion had done the job. And then came another lash. An another.Each time he tensed up, and each time he was scared of relaxing, not wanting to suffer the shame of making a mess. But staying tightly wound made the whip hurt him even more. And it was running out of real estate on which to apply new roads of red. Now the heavy implement was sending down strokes across ground already tread, and his sore welts and cuts explode with renewed agony.Leaning forward, clenching his thighs… it left his balls all bunched up at the bottom of the daisydukes. And clearly his handler knew it. The next lick of the whip was softened by the thick denim protecting him, but the impact still resonated through his balls, making him squeal. Shock left him without movement for a few moments as he heard his sore voice try to make noise. His vision was covered in black spots and whirling areas of clarity as he tried to make sense of the pain.And then the laughter was back.Louder.And he felt the heat between his legs. The way the denim clung to him. The warmth that trickled down over his thighs and onto the floor.His face became red as shame and embarrassment took over for pain, and he tried to keep his head down when his handler stood in front of him, mocking him for making a mess. This was already supposed to be discipline, they said. This was clearly not punishment enough.“But that’s an issue for the future, Pet… For now, let’s get you cleaned up.”The wet short shorts were tugged off of him unceremoniously, with an added threat that he’d wear them on his face if he struggled. Then his wrists were untied one at a time and caught in a new looped knot. The rope went from behind his neck down between his legs, and then back up where it was fitted around his wrists and tightened. Another loop of rope Went from his neck down his back and around the same wrists, forcing him to keep his hands still if he wanted to breathe properly.He was allowed to stand, but that was too much and he fell against his handler, their cooing voice only serving to make his humiliation worse. Talk of how vulnerable he was, how out of control his fear was making him. It made him want to cry. In fact, he was so out of it, every step banging his balls about, that he wasn’t sure he didn’t.And then he was tossed into the shower stall, pushed against the wall while warm water ran down their skin. One hand caressed and stroked his aching balls, his dick… and the other unceremoniously shoved the whip’s rough handle up his entrance. He wheezed in pain, but the intrusion continued. Twist. Thrust. Twist. Thrust. Tug. Twist. Thrust.What he hoped was just residual body oil quickly slicked the channel, until the heavy whip’s handle was thoroughly reaming him. Once per second, a speed he was sure no one could match, not with that intensity and length so deep inside. He whimpered, his body shuddering under the assault. Unmistakable heat spread through him at the rough treatment, especially once the rough handle’s end was pounding against his prostate and making him see stars again.His knees buckled, and now most of his weight was on the cruel implement, but his handler just tsk-ed him.“Now now, Pet. How am I going to test each of the suitors for stamina if you’re already all fucked out? Remember, I only want to see the one that cums the most often. You better pay attention to all six of them when they get here in a few… but for now let’s get you all cleaned up…”

Alphabet April V - virgin, vampire, vulnerable, vibrator
“There’s our little freak of nature…”The pretty little thing walked slowly, carefully through the empty show floor. A simple handbag, a frilly skirt that barely went down past mid-thigh, a shirt covered in lace and frills that did nothing to cover her midriff.The vampire was really looking the part of someone who’d walked straight out of Victorian london as told by internet perverts. Her beautiful features were certainly adding to the picture, and the Hunter licked his lips at the sight of her bending down and using some tumblers on an old car.At first he’d thought it weird that a vampire would make their lair a public area… but it’s not like anyone went up to the cars and looked inside them. All she had to do was get in the trunk for the day and voila, easy hiding spot. Now she was going in the two-seater, however, sitting herself in the middle of the cushy bench.The coupe was an antique, the kind you’d see in an old mobster movie. There wasn’t all that much space to move around inside, and from his vantage point the Hunter could see every inch of it. From the smooth brown bangs hanging in her face to the soft looking knees and thighs peeking out from under the frilly skirt.He had to remind himself to close his mouth and stop staring. He tried to focus on something else… Her hand. Yeah, her… That was going under the skirt and whoa whoa whoa other hand. She was biting her finger, clearly enjoying whatever was happening down there and… Was that a purity ring?There was no way this vampire was a virgin.No way… right?Still looking through the sniper’s scope, the Hunter swallowed as the monster looked around herself, and pulled something small and white from her purse. That also went under the skirt, and suddenly the creature was melting into the seats, arching her back and making little mewing motions with her lips.His pants were getting tight. He really should just take the shot… But now she was looking around with a mischievous grin and he had to duck behind the rooftop to make sure he wasn’t spotted. By the time he peeked over again she had lain herself across the seat’s back, skirt flipped up and properly mooning him now.It was the prettiest tush he’d seen in a long time. Hell, even the hard and jumping dick between the vamp’s thighs wasn’t enough to make his own little soldier go away. Now he was transfixed as the creature pumped the clearly vibrating toy into itself, thrusting its hips back and forth as if it were really being fucked over the seat in the ancient car.Before he knew what he was doing, his trigger finger was squeezing down over his aching bulge, his own hips rolling up and down. Thanks to the rifle’s sight he could see just how tightly that ring of muscle was gripping around the toy, could see every bit of movement as it was slid back and forth inside the vampire’s ass.He could almost imagine just how it would feel to be squeezed into that little car and making the most of the space to push the smaller body down and fuck it hard, following the erotic rhythm the creature was doing to itself.The more he watched, the harder it was to even think about looking away. Soon he had his hand stuffed down his pants instead of just grabbing the excited bulge, fingers closed tight around his boxer briefs and grunting as he slid the fabric back and forth. A makeshift tunnel for his dick to fuck, especially with how much it was leaking, excited for action.Watching that tight ass shake and wiggle and bounce, clenching down on that buzzing vibrator… Seeing the untouched cock jump and leak and clearly be desperate for attention, but ignored… The whole sight of it had him humping his hand till he creamed, embarrassment flooding through him almost immediately.Absent mindedly he wiped his hand off against his hip and he took aim again.The vampire was gone.And now there was a high-heeled foot pressing on his back.“Fucking perv. You really should have hidden the smell better… anyway, even if I can’t do it with you doesn’t mean I won’t have fun making you spill again and again and again… You’ll be begging me to stop and saying you’ll leave me alone soon enough…”

Alphabet April: U - Uncut, uniform, urgent, undressing, unabashed
The lock in the door clicked.I held my breath.My knees and ankles ached from being on the linoleum tiles for so long. My shoulders were sore. The ropes keeping my wrists tied to my elbows and behind my back rubbed my skin raw, and keeping my ass up in the air while my head was down on the floor was starting to take a real effort.None of that mattered.Not even the fact that I wasn’t wearing a single thing on me other than ropes, a blindfold and a thong whose single triangular patch of cloth was barely big enough to separate my balls, much less hide anything.I wasn’t even bothered by the shocked gasp that came from the doorway. He must have brought friends over. Sure , a part of me felt nervous as hell… Who were they? Did I know them? Were they looking at me with disgust? Lust? A mix of both?Those thoughts were swept away by His smooth baritone.“Like I said, the Pet’s got all the discipline in the world. Isn’t that right boy? Now, let’s get started and you can show this pair just how good a boy you are.”The door closed and I sat up, turning around but staying on my knees. I licked my lips. We’d both been too busy for week, and now he brings in others? I was aching for his attention, and now I’d need to show off instead?I shivered as the heat bloomed from the first shiver in my spine all across my body. Even through the blindfold, I was sure I could see his eyes on me. Inspecting. Appraising. Admiring.“Well, Boy? Get to work. I want out of these stuffy clothes so I can get to fucking you hard. My friends here’ll watch… maybe they’ll get a second and third go at you… if you’re fast enough and earn the privilege. You gonna be a Good Boy?”Awkwardly I shuffled on my knees until I was pressing my mouth against him. I mouthed the familiar length and thickness of his controlled erection through his pants, only hopping to my feet one I was sure he’d swore under his breath to stay in control.He was as eager as I was.Good.The thought of doing this under someone else’s gaze didn’t really slow me as I straightened and stood, groaning from the creaking in my knees. I’d have to ask for a pillow soon, just in case. Now, however…Scared to lose my balance, I slid my face up the fabric of his uniform until I was fully straightened. I felt every inch of his bulging rod, tantalizing through the fabric of his pants. His jacket was even smoother, and I counted the large buttons whenever I felt one go by.And then I was nuzzling in his neck, leaning on his chest and demanding attention. It was wrong of me, and he playfully smacked my exposed butt cheek, but he didn’t seem to mind too much once I was hungrily sucking on his neck, nibbling my way slowly down his jaw, lower still to the first obstacle.I’d gotten a lot of practice at the movement, but it still took me a few tries to get the button of his collar to open up. I ignored the second, instead going down and catching his jacket’s cloth here and there. Each time, my tongue expertly pushed a thick button through so the whole thing could hang open. I went all the way down… and felt very proud of myself when I didn’t fall to my knees so I could get to working on his dick directly.His fingers slid through my hair.His rumbling was a compliment to my self-control.I beamed as I moved up again, repeating my exploits with the collar button as I felt him shift, tossing the unneeded jacket to one of the pair with him. I wasn’t really focussing on that, instead I was concentrating on the buttons of his white shirt.Each one took a few tries, but each time I could almost feel his body press closer to mine. He was eager as well, and I didn’t want to disappoint him. Finally the dress shirt was also fully opened, and I didn’t wait. I breathed deep as I buried my face in his chest. The dark fuzz tickled my nose and the scent of his aftershave, still potent, made my head spin.I wanted to be buried under those muscles, to have my senses invaded by those scents and sensations until I was begging to stop. Instead, I stepped back once so I could more properly lean down to bite and nudge at his buckle. I was too eager. I pulled too early each time. Before I could get solid purchase.I whimpered, scared he’d be mad, but instead all I heard was a pleasant chuckle and two stunned silences.“That’s okay boy, I’ll give you a freebie…”I heard the snap of leather in the air as he tugged the belt out, and it was so sharp, so fierce, that my knees gave out. Suddenly I was kneeling and pushing my face against that alluring bulge again, though with a bit of pressure he was able to guide me to his top button.Pushing it open and unzipping him with my teeth, I knew before the sound that he’d let his pants drop unceremoniously. Part of it was the heat. Part of it was the new scent in the air. And part of it was how he knotted the fingers of one hand in my hair, tugging me close and slowly rolling his hips so he could hump my face.I moaned against the fabric of his underwear, but I didn’t get to tug it down this time. Instead he did it with a thumb, soon forcing my face against his turgid and greedy shaft.“See what he has to deal with every day, boys? I bet I can make him squeal for more before we even more to the bedroom.Nervous shuffling. Clearly the pair were still more than a little confused as to how readily someone could put themselves through this. Doubly so when the leather strip cracked through the air and landed at the base of my back, making me arch in what he’d called my best position.I was hard as a rock, though.And so was the python quickly pressing against my lips. Another crack of the improvised whip, another inch thrust past my lips. My tongue played with the uncut skin on his tip, teasing at the sensitive flesh past it. My breathing was deep and reverent, even with the pain blossoming across my back.I was a likely going to be a mess of red welts by the time we were done, but I didn’t care.My throat tightened around the thick shaft, nose tickled by the neatly trimmed bush and rolling the eyes in the back of my head.I mean.He gripped harder, Pulled harder.I was in heaven.
