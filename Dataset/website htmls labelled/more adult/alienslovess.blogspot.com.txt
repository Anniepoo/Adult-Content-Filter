Aliens
It is interesting that we use the word aliens to describe people from another planet just as readily as we use it to describe people who sneak into the country. Although it is considered bad form, some people use the word freely to describe legal immigrants as well. Either way, the term alien is simply meant to be used to describe something foreign to us. We can have alien thoughts and alien ideas just as easily as we can offend someone with our alien arguments. I don’t think it is the word that is meant to be so offensive, but the connotation we have developed in spite of the meaning. When we refer to someone as an alien, we are making a statement; most often about their race and the perceived right they have to be in the country. While we are all a little alien to some degree, we hold illegal aliens in the highest form of disregard. There are plenty of ways to enter the country legally, this is true, but for some people coming into the country illegally is their only measure for a desperate situation. The term alien applies to them only in the fact that they were born elsewhere. Yet we look down our noses at the alien population. I wonder how we would regard aliens that came from space, assuming aliens wouldn’t come from elsewhere like the depths of the deepest parts of the ocean. There is plenty for everyone. We need not assign people of different nationalities the title of alien in order to feel like they are infringing on our human rights. If we all worked together, we could make the world a place where there was no need for the “aliens” to escape.

Maybe image
An alien is usually associated with an image of an impossibly portentous and scaring creature. But if an alien is that ugly and horrible why do so many people wish to meet one (or even several) in real life? To check a character, to experience shaping, to increase the power of will or to get ready for the worst? In my view, it is a reasonable, but doubtfully a probable supposition. I am deeply convinced that human would like to meet aliens because of mere curiosity. By all means, communicating face to face with an intelligent being is sure to raise your excitement. Only hope it is safe enough! At the same time, a very skeptical half of population doesn’t believe that aliens actually exist. They pretend not to pay the slightest attention to the fact that millions and millions of people are sure of the contrary. Those 'non-believers' are almost sure that all (just imagine, ALL!) other planets are uninhabited. Isn't it too self-reliant for a mere frail human being? I personally think it is stupid. Can one calculate the size of the Universe? No way! So how can we say for sure what exists in space and what does not? The modern science has not yet realized the depth of unknown and the eternal abyss of Universe. So, as i come to think of it, i realize how absurd it is to think that in the whole Universe there is no intelligent life except on Earth. This might be a completely different kind of life and we may even never meet or understand each other. Apart from that, i am a hundred per cent sure they exist. They do!Do you agree that considering the Universe an uninhabited abyss of atoms and eternal freeze is sensible?

Legal aliens, illegal aliens, and citizens of the United States
Legal aliens, illegal aliens, and citizens of the United States have been debating the immigration and alien laws for a very long time. Somehow we have all forgotten that we are all aliens and that we expect the world to cater to our needs. How often do we demand that aliens in this country learn to speak our language but how much effort do we put into learning enough of another language before we visit another country, let alone move there. We simply expect that all the aliens who enter this country will do so on our own terms.Additionally, the debate grows as we continue to allow aliens to migrate to the country but we are less than welcoming. The melting pot of America has turned into the melting pot of prejudice. Just because an alien enters the country doesn’t mean that he or she is here to steal your job, or to corrupt your children. This is the one country that was founded on the idea that everyone could have a fair shake in the world, and people continue to want to give their fair shake a go. There is no reason to keep aliens out, provided that they come to the country legally and they have no ill will toward the country. How can we ask that aliens come into the country when all we do is respond to them with indifference, or worse? We are all aliens to this country and nobody owns it comply because they have a longer lineage line than someone else.

Aliens among us
The newcomers can easily be among us. Only we, for various reasons do not notice. Either unable to find either not do the necessary efforts. And the people themselves may be of extraterrestrial origin of genes, not conjecture this. Aliens are somewhere nearby. Alas, the green man with extraordinary technology, we are not talking. According to the aforementioned scholars, these aliens are likely to be primitive microbes; we have emerged about 4 billion years ago.
At that time, the Earth, as we know, has been bombed meteoric and giant asteroids in which certain forms of life may have arrived on Earth from space and modest living next to us. Davis acknowledges that the theory is speculative, the based speculative opinions. But, referring to some statistics, he said that life on other planets like Earth could exist with 95-percent probability.
The basic idea is that if life easily and quickly formed, and agree with that many astrobiology, of course, on Earth it was formed more than once. From what we know about the early period of life on Earth, it appeared rather quickly, as soon as the conditions for it have been appropriate. Therefore, we can easily assume that if life arose here on Earth, with a probability of 95% this happened two or three times or more. Who knows? ".
Scientists believe that the bombardment of the planet may have resulted in a number of discontinuity "experiments" in which life arose and destroyed subsequent hail meteors and asteroids.
