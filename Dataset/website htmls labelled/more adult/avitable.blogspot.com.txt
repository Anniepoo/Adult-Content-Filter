I am Avitable. Currently, I live in Orlando, where I collect comic books and masturbate to midget horse porn.
I am married, and my wife lets me be the true geek that I am.
I fear vegetables and sunlight.
I love my friends and family dearly and hate everyone else tremendously.

It's only fair.
I'd do it for you.
C'mon, just do it.

If while readi1ng this blog, you laugh hysterically, fall off your seat, pee just a little in your pants, and pull down your monitor on your head, I'm not liable.
If you get up in disgust and walk away, completely unamused, trip on the mass of wires next to your computer and end up with your mouse lodged in your right eyesocket, I'm not liable.
If you're reading this blog and you fall asleep because it sucks horribly, and you land facefirst on your keyboard and have a permanent "Y" stuck in your forehead, I'm not liable, but send me a pic so I can laugh at you.
If you suffer emotional distress from my laughing at you, then you can sue.
VERY IMPORTANT!!
If you have, at any point in your life, participated in or enjoyed any of the following activities (watched wrestling, visited a NASCAR track more than once, watched Jeff Foxworthy, finger fucked your cousin, know one or two country music stations by their call sign, name and slogan, eaten roadkill, purchased furniture or electronics from rent-to-own, slept in your own puke for more than one consecutive evening, or worn a baseball cap backwards), you must close this window, shut off your computer, grab the nearest utensil, and shove it directly into your belly button.
Then lift straight up, twisting a little, until you feel a slight *twinge*.
