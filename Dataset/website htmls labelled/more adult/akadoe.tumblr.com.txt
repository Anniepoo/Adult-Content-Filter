If under 18, please don't follow. Much of what I post is erotica.
I attempt to combine the 'right' words and image, and capture a moment of "life". A snapshot of someones existence.

kiss the lips that lie to her
“Immodest creature, you do not want a woman who will accept your faults, you want the one who pretends you are faultless – one who will caress the hand that strikes her and kiss the lips that lie to her.“(Letter, 17 June 1837)”― George Sand, The Intimate Journal

Quotes About Undying Devotion
Pauline Réage“Keep me rather in this cage, and feed me sparingly, if you dare. Anything that brings me closer to illness and the edge of death makes me more faithful. It is only when you make me suffer that I feel safe and secure. You should never have agreed to be a god for me if you were afraid to assume the duties of a god, and we know that they are not as tender as all that. You have already seen me cry. Now you must learn to relish my tears.”― Pauline Réage
#cage cruelty dark faith god love sacrifice slavery submission suffering undying-devotion unfreedom

“The hormone enemas  you force in your wife’s ass every day are working. I would enjoy listening to her moans and whimperingWatching the hormone enemas flowing into her ass, would make my pussy wet.I’d need to finger my pussy until I cum, while your wife is suffering.I’ll milk her wife’s fat tits dry, then we’ll enjoy her warm milk.” http://ctfictionwriter.tumblr.com

We met for coffee.Just coffee.  Another meeting. Why might this time be different?  Well, she was hungry.  And I was ravenous.

ABOUT ME
I am bold, daring and fearless, I make no effort to stand out from the crowd, this sort of thing comes naturally to me. I am the pattern on a plain canvas from which excitement springs. I am guilty of being different and make no effort to change. I am basically like Neo from the Matrix.
