How fast will cock travel from “on your mind” to “in your brain”?
In my case it seems never fast enough.

Judge says cops caught sending racist and homophobic texts get to keep their jobs
At least fourteen officers were involved in the texting scandal. Authorities say that the offensive texts targeted blacks, Mexicans, Filipinos and gay men, and which make repeated use of racist and homophobic slurs, were sent between 2011 and 2012, according to the Associated Press.
‘It’s not against the law to put an animal down,’ an officer said, referring to a black man in Furminger’s house.
Court documents in the Furminger case said officers used their phones to text offensive messages. In the texts, Furminger used racial epithets, bragged that a relative was a slave auctioneer, and joked about the Ku Klux Klan. He also sent texts insulting Latinos and gay people, the documents said.
The offensive texts came to light during an FBI corruption investigation.
Prosecutors have been forced to review thousands of arrests linked to the officers, which has led to the dismissal of 13 criminal cases thus far, according to the San Francisco District Attorney’s Office.
I’m sure these are not the first batch of racist cops or judges. Unfortunately there is racism through all branches of government and when we elect them we need to research. Who you are putting in a position of authority. If majority rules we are in deep shit. Because the majority of voters choose a candidate that shares their views, values, or morals. #Hate it!
You should hear us talk !!Makes these look like Choir Boys.I miss the good old days of Cross Burnings
