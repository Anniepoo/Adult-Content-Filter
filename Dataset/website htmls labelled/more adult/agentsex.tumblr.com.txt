‘Making a Murderer’ convict Steven Avery’s ex-fiancee says he’s guilty and 'beat me all the time’
businessinsider-yahoopartner:
(HLN) The ex-fiancee of Steven Avery, seen in “Making a Murderer,” has very different words from what she said in the Netflix true-crime documentary.
Jodi Stachowski did an interview with Nancy Grace’s HLN show that aired Wednesday night, in which she says she believes Avery is “not innocent.”
Asked about her history with Avery, she says that he was physically abusive toward her and that they only had “two” good times together.
“He’d beat me all the time, punch me, throw me against the wall,“ Stachowski said.
Her relationship with Avery and their engagement ended while Avery was arrested for and eventually convicted of the murder of Teresa Halbach in 2005. In the documentary, she’s seen supporting Avery and providing evidence that he didn’t commit the murder, saying she talked to him the night of the crime and he didn’t sound rushed.
Stachowski now says her comments in "Making a Murderer” were an “act,” and compares Avery to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.
Avery can be a "semi-nice person, and then behind closed doors, he’s a monster,“ she said.
She also claims that he threatened to "kill me, my family, and a friend of mine,” and told her that “if I didn’t say anything good and nice about him, I’d pay.”
And perhaps most bizarre of all, Stachowski also claims, “I ate two boxes of rat poison just so I could go to the hospital and get away from him.”

Am I the only one who thinks Steven Avery did it?
juliannagrace:
I watched the whole documentary. What happened to him the first time around totally sucks. There is stuff involved in the case and evidence that do not make sense. I do NOT believe Brenden Dassey did anything. I do think that Steven Avery did or at least do not think that it is totally unbelievable that he did.
Obviously, things were left out of the documentary because painting a picture of an obviously innocent man accused for a second time is a much better story than the reality that there is actual evidence linking Avery to the crime.
It’s a movie.
I don’t know.
I guess my point is that I didn’t get the same passionate feelings of disbelief when I watched. Maybe I’m a cold hearted snake.
You’re definitely not the only one. I think he’s guilty.

Nurse was to testify she punctured Avery blood vial; experts say holes common
I think there’s going to be a lot of press coming that makes “Making a Murderer” look pretty bad.

Castiel couldn’t be possessed because Cas is possessing Jimmy Novak. Castiel isn’t human.
Jimmy’s dead.
Yeah, but Jimmy’s body can’t contain two angels - Lucifer can’t possess Cas, he can only displace him and take the vessel himself.
yo i don’t know what bullshit the show’sgonna pull out of its ass but you can bet logic doesn’t come into play
That’s true, they don’t give a shit. They should just have all the characters possess Sam so the series is nothing but Padalecki I mean why not.

I was talking to one of my (grown-up) sisters in the phone and I asked her if it was true that my younger (teenage) brother is gay. She paused a long time and then said that he was just having trouble adjusting and that he didn’t have many friends because he didn’t know any boys *like him* that he could be friends with.
So …. Rumor confirmed?
She also said he wasn’t gay, he’s just a lot like our other brother at that age, and while our other brother is straight, he is also flamboyant as all hell so I don’t know what to think.

“The droid we seek is aboard the Millenium Falcon in the hands of your father… Han Solo.”
A version of this scene was shot with Kylo Ren mask-less, and the real masked version digitally replaced it later. This behind-the-scenes footage comes from the Star Wars: The Force Awakens VFX Breakdown - Before and After (the video keeps getting taken down so I don’t have a link to share unfortunately).
Why would they cover up an actor’s face at an emotional moment?(via cleolinda)
