Sunday, February 08, 2004
Before we go too far here's a mini biography on her:
Cate Blanchett graduated from Australia's National Institute of Dramatic Art in 1992 and in a little over a year had won both critical and popular acclaim. On graduating from NIDA, she joined the Sydney Theatre Company's production of Caryl Churchill's Top Girls, then played Felice Bauer, the bride, in Timothy Dalyâ€™s Kafka Dances, winning the 1993 Newcomer Award from the Sydney Theatre Critics Circle for her performance.
From there Blanchett moved to the role of Carol in David Mamet's searing polemic Oleanna, also for the Sydney Theatre Company, and won the Rosemont Best Actress Award, her second award that year.
She then co-starred in the ABC Television's prime time drama _"Heartland" (1994)_ , again winning critical acclaim. In 1995, she was nominated for Best Female Performance for her role as Ophelia in the Belvoir Street Theatre Company's production of Hamlet. Other theatre credits include Helen in the Sydney Theatre Company's Sweet Phoebe, Miranda in The Tempest and Rose in The Blind Giant is Dancing, both for the Belvoir Street Theatre Company.
In other television roles, Blanchett starred as Bianca in ABC's _"Bordertown" (1995)_ , as Janie Morris in _"G.P." (1994)_ and in ABC's popular series _"Police Rescue" (1994)_ .
She made her feature film debut in Paradise Road (1997), and, in 1998, she played the title character in Elizabeth (1998), winning numerous awards for her performance, including the Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Drama. Cate was also nominated for an Academy Award for the role but lost out to Gwyneth Paltrow.
2001 was a particularly busy year, with starring roles in Bandits (2001), Shipping News, The (2001), Charlotte Gray (2001) and playing Elf Queen Galadriel in the Lord Of The Rings trilogy.
