alanturing:
1. Pamela - brought fancy chocolates for the class, very sweet, calm and got along with everyone
2. Amy - nice to me, fun mom, gave me 4 pieces of palette paper while exclaiming “YOU NEED MORE PAPER, IM A MOM”
3. Anne - also brought chocolate and was nice to me
4. Mary Ann - wore timberlands every day
5. Deb - we didn’t talk but she made my fave paintings in the class
6. Tessa - wore all denim, asked me how to pronounce the prof’s name, i said i didn’t know, we agreed on the wrong pronunciation and both called her that for the entire week
7. Pavel - french dad, found out i was majoring in physics and asked me if i knew that einstein was a jerk
8. Andy - brought dunkin donuts munchkins and wore an “Old Guys Rule” t shirt despite appearing to be in his mid 40s
9. Gretchen - didn’t talk that much but she was adorable
10. Aileen - honestly not entirely sure who she is
11. Lisa - i think she might have been my middle school art teacher but i didn’t ask and she didn’t recognize me so
12. Susan - refused to use anything but charcoal and made me nervous
13. Tina - wore heels every day, had “my children bully your children” vibes
