All Women ARE Beautiful
All Women ARE Beautiful
The premise is simple.
All women are beautiful.
I'm hoping this blog will prove it, by posting loads of photos of women I think are beautiful.
Some of these are glamour models - yes, sure they are beautiful, but if you want to see photos of REAL women without plastic boobs and pussies shaved to within an inch of their lives, I may be able to help you.
Clothes or no clothes, you are beautiful.
Every bit of you is beautiful.
That reminds me, there is a LOT of gratuitous nudity here.
So, if you are under 18 you really shouldn't be here. Goodbye.
NSFW and all that.
If you want a photo removed for copyright or any other reason, just let me know. Most of them are plastered all over Her Majesty's internet anyway.
Submit a photo - if you would like to find a place among the beautiful people, send me a photo, clothed or unclothed, or just your pretty face, I'd love that.
I'd like to see your face, so no headless shots please, my dear.
Gentle reader, this blog is a penis free zone, so hard core photos will be politely ignored.
Who am I? The last Victorian. English. Very English. I was born in an age of steam and steel, so please bear with me as I struggle with this curious technology.
Anyway, if you want someone to tell you how beautiful you are, send me a message. Morse code, semaphore, Latin, or even an e-mail if you must.
