Amanda Jane
(NSFW or under 18) Hi, thank you for visiting my blog. As a male, I love to wear panties under my everyday clothes and my female persona, Amanda, loves to wear silky, pretty lingerie. Though not attracted to men dressed as men, Amanda enjoys men who wear feminine underwear,...

Lack of Activity
Christmas traveling and staying with family sure puts a dent in both posting and keeping up with those I follow on Tumblr. Sorry.
Normal service will be resumed as soon as possible. Happy New Year to all. Amanda Jane.

The Storm
As the last sessions of the Conference were adjourned and the delegates assembled for the closing event, it began to snow and snow heavily. The skies darkened, the wind rose fiercely and before the end of the event there was a storm raging outside. Most of us had requested extensions to the time we had to vacate our rooms and just as we set about lugging cases down to the lobby a hotel speaker announced that, due to exceptional weather conditions, the city airport had been closed and all traffic had been advised to stay off the roads. As we later learned, this was to be an historic storm both in its ferocity and duration. The descent towards confusion was averted in a very professional manner as hotel management called a meeting in the lobby. We were quickly assured that things were under control, that the kitchens were well stocked with food, that this circumstance had been experienced before and that procedures were well practiced. However, with a full conference complement unable to leave the hotel and at least some of the expected new guests having arrived and more expected to arrive later, there would be the need to rearrange ourselves and volunteer to share rooms so that each bed was used. Dinner and breakfast would be served in two sittings, based on odd and even room numbers. Reassured, we somewhat haltingly began to consider how we might double up in the rooms. Knowing nobody well, it became a case of friends quickly grouping together, leaving the odds and sods a more difficult job. By default I and a bilingual French/English speaking man from Quebec were paired for a king bed room. I was not e amounted of the idea of sharing a bed with a male, even a large bed.  He was much younger than I and loudly proclaimed that his wish had been to be paired with a luscious blonde, though later in the day I would have reason to question his true gender preference.With an unexpected crisis on their hands, the hotel did well, dinner being readily available, the bar crowded but efficient and everyone in good spirits while the wind howled outside and the doorman did his best to keep the front steps cleared of rapidly accumulating snow. My room mate was clearly a party person and could be seen cruising the room in animated mode. I soon retreated to the room, expecting my room mate to be joining me much later.  I was surprised, therefore, that he came breezing in about twenty minutes later, just after I had showered, donned night attire and was considering reading in bed. I felt the need to explain that he found me in an over length T shirt because, in the European tradition, I was accustomed to wearing a nightshirt rather than pyjamas, though not accustomed to being seen in it other than by my wife. It did not bother him, and since he was far from ready to sleep as yet, he suggested a movie and produced an opened bottle of scotch from his luggage. That was fine by me, though his intent was to choose an “adult” movie for which our shared room would be charged an additional fee. We settled down on the sofa, he now in brightly patterned silky pyjamas, both with our bathroom tumblers of scotch and ready to watch his choice of XXX movie from several available, though most are typically short on plot and high on sex scenes. His choice involved a profusion of bisexuals, shemales and lesbians in lengthy scenes of close up copulation barely held together by a story that was as unbelievable as it was unnecessary. The scotch was good and the movie “hot” and unavoidably arousing. My embarrassment grew as the bulge in my T-shirt became more obvious to me, but I was surprised and a little shocked that my room mate showed no concern as his bulge pushed his pyjamas up and then slowly poked through the front opening and freely rose up until a very stiff member of remarkable girth and length. I tried to keep my attention on the movie, but found my eyes frequently straying to his lap, a bit astonished at the intensity of my attraction to this spectacle. Coincidentally, the movie story switched to a scene involving a very well hung shemale and an obedient male partner. Perhaps it was this that precipitated the situation. My room mate was unashamedly fondling his very erect cock that was at a stage of tumescence that mine, still bulging but hidden under my nightshirt, had never even imagined let alone achieved. He made a soft noise and his body language spoke volumes about what he urgently wanted. I could claim that I was mesmerized and/or that the scotch had befuddled my better judgement, but with little hesitation I found myself leaning over and grasping his firm shaft, instantly fascinated by the feel of this large warm thing in my grip. He moved his hips up and down, readily indicating that he wanted me to rub the pink shaft and darker bulbous head with vigour. I began to do so, and in response he spread his legs wider and leaned back to enjoy the massage. He must have been of practiced stamina, for my hand steadily worked up and down until my arm began to ache. He must have sensed this, for without spoken word he reached out and began to pull me down towards his even more swollen cock. I resisted at first, for, please believe me, I had never done what he was asking me to do, and indeed I was not even sure I knew how. Again, I could blame the scotch, but almost without choosing to, I relaxed and leaned down, instinctively opening my mouth to enclose the large, firm knob and salivating to provide needed lubrication. It was an amazing mouthful and it seemed entirely natural to grasp the lower part of his shaft and begin to bob my head slowly up and down. Though we had not spoken, the noises now certainly indicated his pleasure and appreciation, as I briefly panicked and wondered what I would be expected to do if he came to orgasm. I became more brave, now taking as much of his shaft into my mouth as I felt I could, then sliding up until almost releasing the head, taking a quick flick of the tongue at that most sensitive part just under the head and then plunging downward again. There was a tinge of shame in my realization that I was enjoying this new experience. And then the inevitable happened. Quite suddenly my mouth was filling with warm liquid, squirt after squirt in short succession until it dribbled out of the sides of my mouth and flowed down into my hand still gripping the shaft. I swallowed, anxious to breathe, and still a little more squirted in before the flow subsided. I thought of the little puddle that I often formed in the palm of my hand when masturbating and was impressed by the difference. At last I raised my head and saw that he was smiling. He didn’t say anything about those last few tens of minutes, not a word of thanks or praise, as if he was accustomed to having his way. He made no move to reciprocate, not even glancing at my still visible bulge, and instead got up and set about replenishing our scotch. The movie was still churning on, three lesbians now licking and dildoing each other with relish, but our interest was diminished, though I would have much appreciated being relieved myself and even considered visiting the bathroom to achieve that. It was only a little while later that we finished the scotch and decided who would sleep on which side of the king size bed. After that new and somewhat bewildering experience I was thinking that I was glad the bed was so large and that we would have plenty of space between us as we slept. So, it was lights out and each of us probably hoping that the other did not snore. I think I fell asleep quickly, though my dreams were much affected by the event of that evening, and I drifted in and out of that realm somewhere between reality and fantasy. In such a dreamworld, time is immaterial and one has only a limited sense of sounds and sensations that might be real as distinct from imagined. However, at some point I began to veer towards what might be reality and gradually came to the realization that I was sleeping in a foetal position, my nightshirt pulled up high and that a warm, resilient object was poking about between the cheeks of my bottom. Only half awake, I did not move, pretending for the moment to still be asleep. This I had not experienced before and though I was well used to using dildos of various kinds in my solo sex times, and had used other toys for prostate massage, I was not at all sure how to react to this rather bold advance that began when still asleep. Before I could think much further, his probing cock zeroed in on its anal target and I realized that he must already have lubricated that area and that it might have been that action that first began to rouse me from my dream sleep. To resist could be risky, since he was bold enough to try to enter me without even waking me and he was certainly aroused enough to want to reach the expected conclusion. I moved a little, pushing back to open my cheeks more and almost immediately he responded by more firmly pushing into the entrance to my ass. In turn I bore down to open the passageway better and then felt his member pass through the constriction and slide up with relative ease. This invader was equal if not bigger than the largest dildo I had ever used, so it was still an extraordinary fullness I felt. I tried hard to relax and just let it happen. He moved back and forth slowly and steadily and, as the rhythm was established, I reached down to work on my own renewed hardness. There was little sound other than the soft movement of the bed coverings and as I relaxed I admitted to myself that while I was certainly being taken advantage of, this was consensual sex. A slight increase in tempo preceded a series of more jerky movements as I sensed rather than felt him pumping deep into me. Then after the climax there was a stillness. I was thinking that we might both fall asleep still locked together when he slowly pulled out, turned over and again said not a word. I fell asleep quickly.I awoke to the sound of the shower running and a few minutes later my room mate walked back into the bedroom naked and towel king himself down. I realized that until now I had not seen him naked and that his figure was indeed to be admired, though his cock, swollen and hard the last time I had seen it now hung long and at ease. He glanced at me still in bed and said a quick bonjour, dressing before sailing out of the door in search of breakfast. It took me a while to fully wake up and I was in the shower when he returned and began gathering his things. When I returned to the room, naked and towel long in my turn, he barely looked at me but gave me the news that the airport buses were running again and that he had a flight to catch. I was still standing there undressed when he left, arms full of luggage. His goodbye was not unfriendly but no reference was made to the events of the night, memorable for me but perhaps routine for him. Over a slow breakfast, having determined that I need not leave until late morning, I mulled on the experience. I had been used, not unkindly but selfishly, with no concern for my feelings or needs, yet I had permitted it and had raised no real objection. He, I imagined, probably went through life like that, never short of sexual partners of either gender but in any liaison only concerned for himself.  It was, in several ways, a lesson on how not to behave in casual sexual encounters, for to leave someone feeling that they had been consenting yet used, as I was feeling, was not something for which I wished to be responsible in future.So, because of the freak storm that last day of the Conference, I was left with both a memorable first time experience and a lesson learned.Amanda Jane

69pantymeat asked:
Your blog Is amazing I also live wearing women's underwear and I also love shopping for my lingerie , being served by a women in a lingerie store has to be the best feeling in the world , I believe they know the panties and bras are for me
! Thank you for posting your beautiful pics and teasing me !
Thank you. Yes, I think many of the women serving behind the lingerie counters have a good idea that the item is not for the girlfriend or wife. Did you read “The Shop” where I related my first purchase of panties. That assistant knew, I’m sure.
