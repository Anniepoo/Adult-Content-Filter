Update on the tagging problem
missharpersworld:
sirskia:
adamadom:
sirskia:

thesubkitten:
Basically - there is no update.  Twenty four hours later, I have heard nothing from either staff or support. I have heard today from a number of you that you are having the same problem.  So Tumblr clearly have either made a serious error in judgement or have a serious technical issue.  Either way, they are, so far, not having the decency to acknowledge it and instead have put up a post about Tumblr TV - whatever the hell that is.  If you are having a problem, please do send them a message. Tumblr Support http://support.tumblr.com/  have fanmail.  And https://www.tumblr.com/support has a specific help desk form - send them a message about the problem.  Feel free to send them a link to this post, or to my one from earlier today telling them you have the same problem.
I have found more things that do not work:
The paper airplane thing - even if Tumblr’s response to me is that the airplane thing is replacing the functionality of the @ tag (which it bloody well better not be) it doesn’t work:  In the images below I have tried to send an image to either Buggybee or Missharpersworld:
To the people who have suggested that I log off and on again: I have re-booted my computer, twice.
To the people who have suggested that I simply need to put in the whole name of the person I am looking for - see above. Then see below, where Buggybee isn’t even showing up in Search anymore:
Neither is Missharpersworld except where she has been linked by other blogs:
And I still can’t tag anyone I know: here I tried to tag Visualsymphony - to whom, as many of you will know, I usually send a good morning post every day. As soon as I type in the m in visualsymphony Tumblr won’t even give me any options:
Yeah…they broke something. I can tag people I do not know but not people I do know.
Same for me. I can tag anyone I want that i don’t follow/know but if I follow you I can’t tag you for anything.
@sirskia holycow! It works again! Yay!
Let’s try this again….
@finder-of-things
Maybe it’s fixed?
@adamadom I think you might be right. I can tag again.
Sir and i can’t tag anyone still.  dammit.
@missharpersworld I couldn’t tag for the last three days, tonight I miraculously can. So weird.
