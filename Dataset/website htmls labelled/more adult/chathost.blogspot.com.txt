Summer again
And I am making lesser and lesser money from the Big Webcam Site everyday. Now I am worried about this new 2257 thing. Well, I think my days in porn are close to an end... maybe. Probably not, I like it too much to let some Bush thing end my fun :-)

How to be a cam whore.
I think I'm in the right way - I don't smile (but I laugh a lot) and I wear EMO glasses, but I don't write bad poetry (not anymore) and I don't have a wishlist. Not until tonight, of course :-)

The latest way of giving it all for free :-(
Have you seen that? This is the last trick that the Major Webcam Site did to give more for free. Well, let's hope that it will work as advertising to the girls.
http://groups.ifriends.net It's still a beta.

Christmas gift for religious and/or kinky people
http://www.calendarioromano.co.uk/ Why bother if not all models are really priests? Just the idea of religious men giving wet dreams to guys and gals is enough.
...
If I'll burn in hell for that, at least I will spend the whole eternity hearing The Cramps.

Urban legends
I thought that real money slaves or balloon fetishists were an urban legend, like the needles in Pepsi bottles or honest politicians. But believe me, they exist.
Probably I couldn't stand a money slave (too time consuming, too demanding), but balloons are REAL FUN. I think I'm developing a real balloon fetish. REALLY! The touch of cheap colorful latex on skin, the noises, the smell and the tension before they pop are powerful.
If it will last, only time can tell.

What does a 100 dollars mean for you?
I see girls complaining about slow days when they make only 50 dollars at their webcam sites of choice but for me, if I do for sure 50 a day (that means 300 a week, 1200 a month) would be really, really great. 1200 dollars - even 1000 - would be a great paycheck in my country. And I think that is worth the efforts, because I am in the safety of my home, I work only the time I really want to and I don't have a boss to mess with me.
What does a hundred dollars buy in your city or country?

Black hole
Last night I did a session with a fetishist who wanted to do a "surgery" in my bellybutton. He liked my belly fat and the way my navel looked deeper when I sit. Its easy to me to "enter" someone's weird fantasy, so I began to make my bellybutton larger with a black pen, painting inside the hole and pretending I was cutting and doing an operation.
Now I'm few dollars richer but I have a black hole in the middle of my pouch that seems to last forever. I've washed it a lot of times, used oil, lotion, warm water, but it won't fade. So embarrassing :-)

Fries for free
guestXX entered room guest XX: Hi, can you wear white panties and bra for me?
Me: Hi! That's exactly what I am wearing now, lucky boy!
guest XX: Can you do something for me? Please?
Me: Ok
guest XX: Can you take off your bra and panties now on guest chat? Then I promise I go private.
Me: Why don't you enter video and spend sometime with me, then I promise I keep talking naked with you on guest chat for the time you want.
guest XX: I promise I go private! Please!
Me: Tell me something.
Me: When you go to McDonalds, you ask the clerk to give you the fries for free, then you promise you will buy a sandwich?
guestXX has left

Trying to return
It seems that Blogger is doing a sabotage. Everytime I try to post something, an error, a tilt or something like that and I need to close IE. I know it's in my end, I uninstalled SP2 and everything seems to be fine now.
...
Now I'm giving a chance to the Minor Webcam Site too. I try not to be online at the same time (my second cam is crap), its only for the hurricanes and other tropical storms. I know I won't be doing a lot of money there, the girls charge half the price of the Big Webcam Site, but at least they pay us by wire transfer.

Let's hope the Wicked Witch of the West allows them to return.
