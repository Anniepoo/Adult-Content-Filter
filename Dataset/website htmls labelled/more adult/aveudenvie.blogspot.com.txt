Idyllic 'Idol' wedding
Music brought them together, and on New Year's Eve, Gina Glocksen and
Joe Ruzicka were wed at the chapel at Naper Settlement in a tune-filled
ceremony.
After more than a year of planning, the "American Idol" finalist
and Neuqua Valley High School science teacher exchanged vows in front of
a standing room-only crowd at the Gothic Revival-style chapel built
more than 140 years ago.
"The wedding was beautiful," said Lindsey Nyenhuis, 21, who was a
fan of Glocksen from watching "Idol" before the two became friends. "It
was perfect for her and Joe."
The wedding party for the late afternoon ceremony included fellow
season six "American Idol" contestant Haley Scarnato and winner Jordin
Sparks.
The best man was Ruzicka's brother, Frank. Glocksen's sisters,
Michelle Snell and Jennifer Glocksen, served as matron of honor and maid
of honor, respectively.
Glocksen, 24, wore an ivory and silver strapless mermaid-style
Melissa Sweet dress purchased from Priscilla of Boston. She wore her
hair down, with her trademark red streak, and accessorized with a veil
she borrowed from the niece of the piano player for "Idol." Ruzicka's
spiked hair also sported a red streak.
