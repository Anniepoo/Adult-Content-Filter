Welcome to Artistic Rollerskating Townsville (ART)
ART formed in January 2015, when some members of the Sk8way Artistic Development Class decided that they would like to go further in the sport. Club members can now work towards completing their bars in the disciplines of dance, figures and free skating.
At ART, our senior members regularly compete in State and National competitions.
Our junior members train hard. They practice, practice, practice. One day they too will compete.
