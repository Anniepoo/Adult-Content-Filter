Female privilege is getting to claim a headache to avoid sex.
Female oppression is having to claim physical illness to avoid sex because men won‚Äôt take a simple fucking ‚Äúno‚Äù for an answer.
Female oppression is men being so entitled that they think being denied sex is oppressive.

hands and the body.
Photographer: Rab Townsend
Model: tlcrmt
I‚Äôm not a person who is typically surprised by stretch marks or scars. Everybody has their own unique markings. But as a photographer who has primarily worked with friends and acquaintances, many of them are not confident about letting them show in their photos. It took me a while to notice it, even, but T had scars from a breast reduction - a type of scarring which I had never seen before. Pretty comfortable in her skin, she didn‚Äôt encourage me to hide it, so I went the opposite extreme and accentuated every mark.
Again, you might notice how preoccupied I became with her hands.
At least leave the credits intact if you reblog.

How intense the spanking seems depends on the angle. I thought it was pretty hard.

Whenever I push myself to do the things I‚Äôm afraid of, whenever I push myself to be visible, the emotional reward is always so worth it. Through my body dysphoria, through my physical pain, I love my body and I love myself, and that love was and continues to be worth the work. It is a daily fight but it fills me up with light and keeps me moving forward.
These photos are a part of¬†‚ÄúSelf Revealed‚Äù The Naked Photography Project. For over a year, photographer Elizabeth Sanjuan continues to photograph over 100 women, giving women of all ages, race, and size the opportunity to express and validate beauty on their terms. The exhibit will have it‚Äôs opening reception on January 9, 2016 at Gallery 2014 in Fort Lauderdale, FL.

‚ÄúWhat matters most: What he had yearned to embrace was not the flesh but a downy spirit, a spark, the impalpable angel that inhabits the flesh. Wind, Sand and Stars.‚Äù
