David Robert Jones (8 January 1947 ‚Äì 10 January 2016), known as David Bowie (/Ààbo ä.i/),[1] was an English singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, record producer, arranger, painter and actor. He was a figure in popular music for over five decades, and was considered by critics and other musicians as an innovator, particularly for his work in the 1970s. Bowie stopped concert touring after 2004, and last performed live at a charity event in 2006. In 2013, he returned from a decade-long recording hiatus, remaining musically active until his death from liver cancer three years later.
Born and raised in south London, Bowie developed an interest in music while at school where he excelled at playing the recorder. As a youth, he enjoyed listening to Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers, the Platters, Fats Domino, Elvis Presley and Little Richard, among others. Bowie‚Äôs musical abilities broadened beyond the recorder when he took up the ukulele and he began to participate in skiffle sessions with friends. When he left school he studied art, music and design, and learned how to typeset. He became fluent on the saxophone in 1962 and formed his first band, that year, at the age of 15. He embarked on a professional career as a musician in 1963, and received his first management contract shortly afterwards. ‚ÄúSpace Oddity‚Äù became his first top five entry on the UK Singles Chart after its release in July 1969. After a three-year period of experimentation, he re-emerged in 1972 during the glam rock era with his flamboyant and androgynous alter ego Ziggy Stardust. The character was spearheaded by his single ‚ÄúStarman‚Äù and album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars. The relatively short-lived Ziggy persona proved to be one facet of a career marked by reinvention, musical innovation and visual presentation.
RIP David Bowie‚Ä¶
