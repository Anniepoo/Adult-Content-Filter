“It’s a bit like platform 9 3/4” a friend of mine said last semester, about the entrance gate at Rikshospitalet. Although not at King’s Cross, London but in the outskirts of Oslo, Norway, the narrow brick-stone passage for students and staff going into the university hospital bears a resemblance to the entrance into the magical … Continue reading →

I am shit at leaving Paris.     Two weeks went by before I even could finish my morning coffee, it seems. Each morning, I’ve installed my little office on the tiny balcony.

Most of us had a favorite place to go when we we’re kids. For me, it was “hemsen”, a semi-floor under the roof, where you had to climb up a ribbed wall. I would play there often on my own, drawing mostly – and playing with barbie horses. It was a place where you could … Continue reading →

Go where you want to go, feel what you feel. That is the first two lines in the song You, Me, War. Today is the UN world refugee day, a day to think about how the desire and need to move is universal, but the freedom to do so voluntarliy is not. In October last … Continue reading →

I once heard about a woman. Every morning she would take as many deep breaths as she was years old. Something about feeling calm, and happy, just  being able to breathe. Having recently dived into my final year of the 20ties, I think I will do the same. Air from the worlds biggest joint resource, … Continue reading →
