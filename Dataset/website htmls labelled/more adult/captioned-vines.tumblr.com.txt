I need some help. I’ve been absent for a month, and I’ve been dealing with some personal matters. During this time, I’ve come to the conclusion I can no longer live under the circumstances I am currently living under. Please, donating anything even 50 cents in order to escape my toxic home would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.
