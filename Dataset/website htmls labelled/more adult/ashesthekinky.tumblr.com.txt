You are SO LUCKY to be able to afford so many toys! I can usually only afford sex shop toys so they're always plain and boring. And none of them really fit my body like I want. I would kill for some of these! <3 Naughty blog @his-cute-kitty
Oh goodness thank you! My partner spoils me absolutely rotten when it comes to the toy department! â™¡ I have been there! Sex toy dildos never really fit my body either. They were always too firm!

Hey, I don't mean to bother you and such. But I was wondering how long does it take for Frisky Beast to deliver to you?
Well, in the past the quickest it has been is a month, month and a half for me most times! Sometimes a little less than that but I would say that is the average for my orders!

I was finally able to take some pretty outdoor shots of my Hyaenadon! This is a size medium, soft firmness, custom marbled shaft and black base with gold sparkles throughout! :) It is so much more beautiful than I could have ever imagined! :)

My Black Friday Stock-Drop Reptilian arrived and it is BIG!!!
I had to double and triple check with some measuring tape if this was indeed a small Reptilian and hoo boy, it really is. Itâ€™sâ€” so much more bigger than I anticipated woah, but gorgeous nonetheless!
There is a light speck of brown on the side of the shaft in the inner circle of the base, but nothing that bothers me. The shaft is lightly marbled with wisps of pale pink and the base is pink with subtle white offset. No fancy sparkles or gitd, but nothing that would upset me deeply!
Wow this thing is girthy as well. I am small (5'2) so the small Reptilian might seem huge to me, but I am overhappy with this snag.
As always, review to come soon (if Iâ€™ll be able to make some time for it!)
This was one of my favorite stock items, everythingâ€™s so subtle!-X
This is such a pretty color!

Something great came in the mail today!!!! I have waited so very long for this missing link and gosh it is good to have this beauty in my hands finally!!! (I will take some better pictures of them soon) All three of these are more goegeous than I ever could have imagined. The wait was rough I must admit, since my missing link order got lost in translation a while ago. BUT Frisky Beast was AMAZING and since the wait was so long they gifted me my new gigabeast, two bags, and a couple of cute paws! Then they also gave me a wonderful discount on my Hyena! This made up for the wait hands down. I cannot wait to try all of these out and thank you again Frisky Beast for everything and being so kind!!
Did it really take 10 months for the missing link? :O
Yeah. Unfortunately. It was really frustrating let me tell you. But it was made up for in the long run so all is well with me now, they were really nice with making it up to me. But it was kinda a stressful experience. -.-

Tails & Portholes
Hey my lovelies! I just want to do a little promo of T&P. She does fabulous colours and really listens to her customers with their ideas and suggestions and preferences! I still have yet to get one of her gorgeous pieces of art but from what Iâ€™ve heard, she delivers some pretty wonderful toys, even offering a cored firmness for if you like soft silicone but you donâ€™t want your toy to flop around. I mean, just look at these gorgeous things! So if youâ€™re shopping around for a pretty oceanic themed toy, Iâ€™d strongly suggest checking her out (plus look at how cute she is! How could you not want to support her?)
I know sheâ€™s recently had to slow down on making toys to pick up a part time job, because her toys just arenâ€™t making her enough, so any support for her would be just awesome guys!! xx
All photos, designs and creations are made by and belong to @tailsnportholes
Awww thanks so much!
ðŸ˜šðŸ˜š no luck on the part time job yet, Iâ€™ll be back to hunting after the holiday.
I recently picked up my first toy from her and it is absolutely fabulous!!! Beautiful colors and just overall fantastic! ^.^

So I am finally, FINALLY dipping my toes into the realm of not only just collecting dildosâ€¦but MAKING them!! I made an account for my one woman shop KuduVoodoo, maker of oddities and fantasy dildos. There I will post pictures of new sculpts, progress shots, and pour shots until I finally get my shop up and running. Good things are to come my fellow fantasy dong fanatics. Good things. â™¡â™¡

Beauty shots of my lovely, newest boy a gorgeous, rainbow Rex!! I have been wanting a Rex for a whileâ€¦but was always iffy about what color to get. So uh, why not all the colors?? Want to know the way to my heart? Rainbow dicks. â™¡ Rex is a wonderful, obedient puppy, size medium, medium firmness with no extra features and I could not be any more in love. I worried about his very pointed tip, which sometimes doesnâ€™t agree with meâ€¦but his knot just kept calling to me. And turns out I didnâ€™t have any problems with his tip! Another rainbow baby to add to my collection ;)

purple-frenzy1713 asked:
Hey Ashes!! I recently found your blog and was wondering if you'd ever gotten Nova the breeder from Bad Dragon and what your thoughts were on him. I'm really tempted to get him but wasn't sure I seem to be stuck between Nova and Ridley
Hey there!! I actually do have a Nova! I have a Nova the Breeder in small, medium firmness and he is BY FAR one of my favorite toys! I eventually want to get him in medium, but for now a small is great. He has great shape and his knots are very smooth and easy to take. Heâ€™s a wonderful toy! But you also mentioned you were stuck between Nova and Ridley! I also have a Ridley and I must say he is a great toy also!! Between Nova and Ridley I would have to say I prefer Ridley, but that is not to put Nova down! They are both really, really great toys with fantastic shape! :) I hope that helped a little!
