Is your Agency protected?
Unlike the Farmers Sponsored Agent's E&O plan, the UFAA E&O plan covers a Farmers Agent's most common mistake, your failure to provide an available Farmers coverage.
The UFAA plan provides broader coverage, one on one risk management, claims and operational privacy, requires your approval to settle any claim and your benefits are not controlled by your Farmers contract.

The UFAA plan saves you $$ because you don't pay for a "one-size-fits-all" plan.
Participation in the Farmers sponsored plan is voluntary.
You have the freedom to choose where you insure.
