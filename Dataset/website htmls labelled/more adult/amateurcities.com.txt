They are not bothered by having their own signature style. Even aesthetic perfection leaves them cold. The self-conscious designer of modernism, with its unassailable belief in social engineering, is waning. One could say that the new architect is more of a hacker.

Despite being almost 40, I enjoy video games very much, and I also think that they are relevant cultural products to be carefully considered in the social sciences (I often use such an argument in order to justify my playing). Included in the console package, there was one video game called Watch Dogs, which monopolized my late summer nights.Read More >>Wishful ThinkingPeder NorrbyHouses throwing up treesWhat if a computer error could physically change our direct surroundings?Read More >>Critical ImaginationChiara QuinziiDiego TernaAn Old Way of Living, Yet InnovativeThe Statement on the International Co-operative Identity ratified by the International Co-operative Alliance (ICA) in 1995 voices that ‘Co-operatives are based on the values of self-sufficiency, self-responsibility, democracy, equality, equity and solidarity’. Nearly 20 years later terms such as ‘self-sufficiency’ have acquired an extensive array of meanings, ranging from energy and food production to the advent of a myriad of types of user-generated multimedia content provided by the so-called web 2.0.Read More >>

The coworker’s professional life is distributed across various places (home, co-working space, the occasional office, depending on the project they are working on) and times (smartphones and other portable devices are also part of this ethos). How does this new architecture of professional and personal life reconfigure time and space?Read More >>Wishful ThinkingAnna RuminskaBorders, 2014What if the nanny state would stop taking care of us?Read More >>Wishful ThinkingArchitecture SnobBuilding Not Available, 2014What if media could replace locality?Read More >>The UnmastersMark van der NetAnia MolendaCristina AmpatzidouFewer Regulations, More Open Source and a Broader ViewThis is what Mark van der Net thinks can uncover new perspectives for architecture and urban planning.Read More >>Critical ImaginationTobias RevellContinuous Monuments and Imaginable AlternativesThis essay aims to connect the world of global homogeny that Superstudio were critiquing with their seminal work ‘The Continuous Monument’ with the modern project of the Smart City and suggest that, particularly with the activation of imagination of technologists, designers, architects and urbanists, this new homogeny might be challenged and alternatives might be imagined.Read More >>

According to this definition an amateur is a person that engages in a pursuit on an unpaid basis; one would assume – out of passion or love.
