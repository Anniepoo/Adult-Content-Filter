My coat just caught fire.
autistech-witch:
On top of everything going on with bills and the vet my only winter coat (that ment a lot to me, I got it when I was homeless and I’ve had it for years) just caught fire in my apartment and while nothing in the house is damaged, my coat is completely fucked and half of it is completely burnt up.
I literally have 4 dollars to my name right now and I don’t know what I’m going to do because part of my job involved standing around outside twice a day waiting for the kids and of course we just had a heavy snow fall tonight.
I only need 15 or 20 dollars to get a used coat if I can find one somewhere in town.
I’m willing to do 1-3 card tarot spreads, custom photosets and videos, digital drawings of you or your OC’S,
pretty much anything for donations at this point.
Donations can be sent to imsostonedicanteven@hotmail.com , please message me if you’re interested in getting a tarot reading or whatever in return for your donation.
If you can’t donate please, please signal boost this. I’m looking at 1,100 dollars in vet bills already I just need to get a coat..(via thegroovycherryblaster)

One of last weekends diapie changes! She gets so blushy when daddy puts her in her big purple diapies, especially when it’s changing out of the previous nights wet one. Good thing we used the big diapies, so it was able to catch her accidents on the drive home! (believe me, there were accidents)
Daddddyyyy!!!!!! 🙈🙈🙈(So blushy right now omggggg 😫)(Source: daddytoadear, via tigerswittlecub)
