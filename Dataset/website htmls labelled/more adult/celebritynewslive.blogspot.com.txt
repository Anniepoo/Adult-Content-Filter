Sam Pinto Kiss Simon Atkins
Old story? Yet still fresh, I like this photo of this star of the Captain Barbell 2011 TV Series, Sam Pinto. Simon Atkins is a lucky guy to lock with her fresh delicious lips.

CNL presents : Freddie Aguilar
First of all, Freddy Aguilar is a folk musician from the Philippines, he became known from his hits "Anak" and "Bayan ko". He is the father of singer-actress, Maegan Aguilar.Anyway, as I was watching Showbiz News Ngayon (Showbiz News Today in english), it was reported by SNN that Freddie Aguilar mentioned that Gary Valenciano, Arnel Pineda of Journey, and Charice Pempengco were called "monkeys" because they mimic the styles of international artists.Well, well, Mr. Aguilar, if I am not mistaken I think you are just jealous of them because even though they mimic the styles of international artists, they are the reason why Filipinos became more popular. As a matter of fact, their singing career goes sky high up to the very peak of success, and yours... forgotten.I just can't imagine how an old, pathetic, out-of-style, good for nothing, singer-composer would say that. I mean come on, in this generation, your songs are just used by some singing beggars down the street.I think my remarks insults you, but before you become insulted, think about the three famous people whom you called a "monkey".
