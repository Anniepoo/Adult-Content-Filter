Someone else's wife...
The RWA theme this week was "old"—which is apparently a word I don't reach for too often. In my current work-in-progress, a search for "old" won me: gold, bold, told, blindfold, hold, and cold. So I slid over to Figment, where I found this.
And yes, I'm still pounding away at this book. I paused, to write 44K on a different novel. That's how my brain works. A little of this, half a dozen of that. Ultimately, something will be finished. At least, that's what I tell myself every day.
Figment is probably my favorite project of all time. I am continually surprised by the characters. The concepts are spilling into other works. I can't escape, and I don't want to. I promise to post a release date, as soon as it releases me.

Alison

John, I'm Only Dancing...
I've dreamed about Bowie.
I've played his mesmerizing voice on vinyl. Cassette. Ether.
But when I think about Bowie, I remember that I listened to his words. Over and over and over. And I did not turn the wheel.

Rose tint my world.
Actually, I'll rose tint it for myself.
That's the plan, anyway.
Radio silence? No. Not me. Just like Marilyn Monroe, I had the radio on. Everything else was tuned out. I've written over the past few months about plans and schemes. Breaking bad habits. Focusing on the positive.
And hello. Guess what?
It's working. I'm working. I'm a work in progress, baby. (Aren't we all?)
This isn't a newsy post. Because I have no news to share. But if you're wondering where I am—I'm right where you left me. At my desk. Fingers stroking the keys. Voices in my head.
The light is on.
My words are running wild.
Fucking themselves in every dark corner, every back alley.
Lick your finger, turn the page, read me all night long.
XXX,
Alison

I resolve to revolve.
Yesterday morning, I asked a friend if she was planning any revolutions for 2016. I meant, of course, resolutions. But my girlfriend just looked at me and then laughed.
"Slip of the tongue," I said.
"What are you up to?" she asked.
And I decided right then that in 2016, I resolve to revolve. To revolt and evolve. There are no stoplights ahead. There aren't even any rules. In the past, I said I spun. I was a dervish then. Now, I'm moving to a slower groove. I'm taking my time. I'm seeing ideas—projects—the whole fucking world—from a variety of angles.
You say you want a resolution?
Well, I'm dissolving (the negative), involving (the positive), and trying my best to solve (the myriad of questions that keep me up in the night).
Turn my switch to "on," baby. Put your ear to my speaker. Close your eyes and listen to my RPMs.
I resolve.
To revolve.
If you let yourself, you'll hear my crackle and hum.
XXX,
Alison
P.S. I'm taking off until the New Year. Please keep sending me your gorgeous photos. Check your mail box for prizes (which I'm late on, but not never on.) Share your own resolutions—or revolutions—here. And have yourself a merry everything and a happy everything else.

Trollop with a Question #88
You've walked past the shoe store more times then you can count. In fact, your soles are wearing thin—but your soul is filled with yearning. The window beckons with promise. Inside there is only one pair of shoes. And they're in your size.
They might be thigh-high boots with chrome zippers running all the way up...
Or, perhaps they're stack-heeled Mary Janes with golden buckles.
Who knows, they could be glossy red patent leather stilettos, and he might be on his knees, ready to lick the pointy tip.
What do your dream shoes look like?
And who are you going to fuck in them?
I mean, what are you going to do in them?
This Monday's question was inspired by Sommer Marsden.
XXX,
Alison
P.S. Yes, those are my shoes. And yes, I'm standing on bubble wrap.

"Alison Tyler makes it look easy..."
I am up to my hooha in deadlines. Okay, you got me. I never, ever say "hooha." I don't even think "hooha." But the other day, I was behind a Honda in traffic, and the owner had changed the word Honda on the spare tire to Hooha. Which cracked me all kinds of up.
So anyway, that tapping sound you hear in your head is me typing. (Or maybe that's the sound I hear in my head.) I'm so focused right now, that I'm writing in my sleep. Although, last night, I had a dream in which I played Dirty Mad Libs with myself. I woke up with the phrase: "She had a (noun) in her mouth." Like you do.
Both of the novels I'm writing are almost at the same place—it's surreal. 135 pages on this one. Nearly the same on that one. I am moving back and forth between the projects, and honestly, I'm loving both. But what it's not is easy. You would not believe how hard I edit my work. I lose more words than I gain on many days, which can be a drag, but hell. I've been doing this so long, I manage to keep my faith.
Still, hearing Lisabet Sarai say I make it look easy is like a cherry on my day. Whipped cream on my morning. Frosting on my... yes, you get the picture. Her review of Those Girls delighted me, and made me refuel my desire to finish Those Days, which is the novel-length book about Sandy—my protagonist in Those Boys & Those Girls.
Thank you, Lisabet. Your words hit me right when I needed to hear them.
XXX,
Alison
P.S. I'll be back on Monday. If you want to thrill me this weekend, hit me with a photo for my December contest (I'm loving the pictures I've received thus far). (Isn't "thus" a fun word to say?) Also, don't forget to answer my Monday question. And, if you're waiting for prizes from me, I'm mailing packages today and tomorrow. They're a little late, but they're wrapped!

He didn't even pack.
He'd bought her flowers at the grocery store, even though he knew she would make fun of the gesture. She wanted fancy flowers. He'd bought daisies. Because it was the thought, right? And to him, she was a daisy.
She'd been the one to surprise him, and he'd had the memory of catching them in bed together etched into his brain even deeper than her name was in his skin.
Yes, there she was.
He didn't do anything. Not like in the soaps where it was all drama all the time. He didn't yell. Didn't beat up the other man. Didn't listen to her tell him that she still loved him. He didn't even pack.
"Wait... don't."
He heard her voice, a wilting flower.
He had his wallet. Fuck the clothes. He'd never want to put them on again. They would smell like her, like the laundry detergent she always used. It had never occurred to him to buy one type of laundry soap for the scent. He'd always purchased whatever happened to be on sale. Or closest to the register.
Fuck the rest. When they'd gotten together, she'd been the best thing that had ever happened to him. When they broke up, he was lower than a ditch.
He never talked to her again.
He was that kind of a man.

Trollop with a Question #87
I'm your nighthawk at the diner. I'm the waitress on the nightshift, hair in a sloppy bun, white lace-trimmed apron over a pale pink uniform. I must be. Because it's still dark outside and I've been up for hours. I dreamed I was writing until I shook myself awake and actually sat down to place my fingers on the keys.
Dream words don't count. The real ones do.
It's Monday, and I haven't stopped for a pause, for a break, for days. I'm simultaneously writing two novels—with two deadlines weighing on my shoulders, breathing down my neck. That cool shiver. That delicious flare.
The best part is that I know where I'm going. With both projects. Uncanny! Unheard of! The worst part is that I hear the clock ticking all the time. Tick. Why aren't you writing? Tock. How dare you sleep?
But here I am for a refill, for a quick double-shot, for a question.
You sit at my counter. It's been a long fucking night. You could use a cup of coffee. You could use a blow job, if we're passing things out. If we're being open between friends. I set your cup on the counter, I slide you a smile, and I ask this question. This one question that lets you know your bad luck has turned golden. That all is going to be well in the world—or at least in the next hour and a half. I tuck a strand of wayward silver-streaked ebony hair behind my ear, and I say...
What?
What do I ask you?
What is that perfect question between strangers? To break the ice. To mend the tears.
You tell me.

The Ridiculous Christmas List
I didn't really adhere to my plan this year. I was going to do themes. I had them all lined up neatly (at least, I did in my head) First, Star Wars. Then... life got in the way, and I woke up and realized with a start, with a bang—two weeks until Christmas, and no lists are in the house!
Sommer nailed me a while back because I do drift around on the net, looking at baubles, and bangles, and other b-words when I am thinking. Seriously. I trail my fingers over trinkets and trench coats, Mary Janes and make-up sets. Sometimes, I'm doing research. My character, Nora, in With or Without You dressed in an interesting fashion that I spent hours compiling. (She had a boom box necklace that I still dream of.)
Which is my roundabout way of saying, this is where I go. What I land on. What I look at. Put them all together, and you end up with The Ridiculous Christmas List.
We start with The Art of Pin-Up, a Taschen title I've been fingering for years. With a price tag of $120, it's more dream than reality. But lovely to look at.
I can't imagine anyone will be surprised to learn that I want this ringing in my house. Yes, it is a payphone replica. No, really.  For about $75 you can step back in time. (You know me and payphones!)
My favorite types of shoes have names like "oxford pumps," "stack-heeled Mary Janes," and "granny boots." These dangerously sexy Doc Martens combine several features I adore. Clunky heel. Lace up. Shiny leather. I can see me in them, striding down the hall in a pencil skirt and crisp white blouse. Is that a handsome man on his knees behind me, or did I just delve into Alison on Top? Sigh. They're currently between $130 and $280.
No luxury list would be complete without perfume. The next on my list is Elie Saab, which my fickle heart has fallen for. At least, today. (Priced between $47 and $95.) I haven't been faithful to a single scent in more than twenty years. It's a problem. But that's one place where cheating works for me.
It's a red record player for $199. Need I say more? Well, maybe. Because here's a jukebox, a mother-fucking jukebox, for a grand. More than 140 of my stories feature jukeboxes. Clearly, I live in a nostalgic corner bar, where quarters are lined up in front of me, and everyone in the place knows I'm about to play Zeppelin.
Green's Dictionary of Slang (in three volumes) sells for $428. I don't know why I think it would be so cool to have this set on my shelf. But my dirty mouth and I both yearn for this.
So I'm looking—I've got books, a phone, music machines, shoes, perfume. What am I missing? Bling, right? Aside from the engagement ring my great-grandfather made for my grandmother, I don't wear diamonds. I am a rhinestone girl to my sparkly little core. So here is the bargain of the list. For under $10, you can snag rhinestone studs that look (to my untrained eye) as good as the real deal. And, hey, you can pretty much buy everything else on the list (plus a car, and maybe a condo) if you don't go for the $125,000 pair.
Now, what's on your wish list? Your secret santa wants to know...

Alison

Love at first sight?
They hated each other. Love at first sight? Not with these two. There was an instant competition. A battle of the wits, then of wills, and finally of fists. Jan didn't know how it started even. Who threw the first punch. It was like they'd always been fighting or about to fight. Now here they were, in the alley behind Vernon's, pounding into each other with the ferocity of animals.
There was skin on skin, the heat of their breath, the sound of their blood.
And Jan realized he wanted something else. He was backed against the bricks. His mouth was bleeding.
But his cock was hard.

David's Vinyl
If you're waiting for my next book club suggestion (or suggestions, so we can choose democratically), know that I'm still making my lists. (And, yes, checking them thrice.) Tuesdays do still feel like Chaucer to me, so I'm a bit at loose ends here. (When I prefer—as you know—to be all tied up.)
So I thought I'd use this Tuesday to show off the first photo I've received so far in my collections series. I tossed out the theme of my books and your obsessions. (I mean, collections.) And this is David's vinyl with two of my (nearly vintage) titles dancing in front.
And holy fuck. I am in awe and in love.
I have used "twisted" in titles at least three times: Tiffany Twisted, Tied Up & Twisted, and just plain Twisted. This must say something about my twisted mind.
The word appears in 915 of my stories. (Oh, man. I am so going to need a new word!)
Please send your pictures with my titles to msalisontyler at yahoo dot com. (You must be 18 or over to submit to me. And other boring words here.)
In other David & musical news, I dreamed I met David Bowie the other night. I was so elated. I have been a fan for more years than you can count on fingers and toes unless you include other people's fingers and toes. (And so yes, I've described a strange orgy.) I  used to wear random rhinestone pins on a football-style jacket as a visual representation (somehow) of Diamond Dogs. But when I got close to Bowie—and I was thinking, "Oh, my god. It's Bowie! It's really Bowie!"—it turned out to be an impersonator.
Seriously. My subconscious dream-psyche saw fit to hire a Bowie impersonator. Without a doubt, I have the strangest dreams.

Trollop with a Question #86
I had the funniest, who's-on-first type of conversation with my mother the other day. She was telling me how much she adored this book she'd read. And I was nodding, thinking I knew the title she was talking about. I hadn't read the book in years, but some of the imagery was still bright in my mind. She'd chosen the title for her book group, she said. I was impressed. I remembered the novel as being quite dark, different from the film.
"There's a film?" she asked.
"Um. Yeah. By Hitchcock."
And then she stared at me as if I'd lost my mind. So. Back up. I was thinking: Strangers on a Train. Book by Patricia Highsmith. Movie by Hitchcock. My mom was talking about The Stranger on a Train. And then things got stranger still. Because I told her Oh, yes, I'd heard about that. But nope. I hadn't. I was thinking The Girl on the Train. When in reality, this is the title she was referring to: Stranger on a Train: Daydreaming and Smoking Around America with Interruptions, a book I've never heard of before.
Which leads us (in a round-about way) to my Monday question. Is there a book that you not only love, yourself, but that you really want other people to appreciate? That you're somehow invested in, emotionally? Because my parents both fell hard for this one. My mom wants her book group to love it, and now insists I read it. (Which I will. Toot de suite, mom. I promise.)
I've talked about my feelings for Wrecking Crew, a memoir that delighted me. I'm going to ponder today a list of other titles, ones I am happy when I learn that my friends appreciated, as well.
And you?

Alison

Whatever you choose... be happy.
I've been thrift-shopping for decades. Used. Re-used. Recycled. Repurposed. These are the words that turn me on. Junking was all about thrift store shopping. New clothes rarely find their way into my closet. I search out items with a feeling of history, a backstory I can make up. Aside from that, I don't want to look like everybody else.
What I appreciate most about thrift-store shopping is the treasure hunt. The seeking for the ultimate *insert what you desire here.* Okay, that may be a lie. I also love the feeling of who knows what you'll find. Not looking for anything particular. Those are the best times. So what I found yesterday—my faith in humanity restored—well, that was totally unexpected.
See, I've discovered that there's a camaraderie to second-hand shopping. I slipped on a jacket I was unsure of, and in a flash, four women were offering their opinions. (One's opinion was that the jacket would look better on her... ha. She was right.)
But this is the part I wanted to share. A shopper could not decide about a pair of heels. They were probably the priciest items in the store. I don't know the brand, but trust me when I say these were high-end, glossy, midnight blue, peep-toe, fuck-the-hell-out-of-me-tonight pumps. She put them on. She took them off. She put them back on and walked around the store. She talked to one of the owners about the outfit she planned to wear. The party she was going to attend.
There was visible hemming and hawing.
The pumps, may I say, looked brilliant even with the jeans she had on. But I cottoned on to the fact that she was going somewhere special, and she wanted to look like a goddess. Like Marilyn Monroe meets Aphrodite.
Ultimately, the owner did this. She packaged up the shoes and put them in a bag. She gave them to the woman and she said, "If you don't wear them, please bring them back on Monday when we open. If you do decide to wear them, call and pay over the phone, or come in to pay."
The shopper was awestruck. "Are you serious? When do I call? When should I pay? Should I call you tonight...?" All sorts of questions. The owner smiled. "Don't worry about this. Take them home. Try them on with your dress. If they're yours..." she shrugged, "you'll know."
I was eavesdropping, like you do in small second-hand stores, and I caught the entire interaction. And this is my favorite part. As the shopper was leaving, the owner said, "Whatever you choose to wear tonight, have a lovely evening." A pause, a beat. "And be happy."
The things you find when you're second-hand shopping. Never what you expect. Always a pleasure. A treasure.
XXX,
Alison
P.S. These are not the shoes the woman bought. These are my very own gorgeous, cobalt, zippered, fuck-the-hell-out-of-me-tonight pumps.

"Cheap Soft Porn"
Several years ago, two readers mistakenly bought one of my short fetish stories because the title was similar to a crime novel. (My story came first by about six years.) I've done things like this. I watched a film called Betty (I think) when a friend recommended Betty Blue. I caught my error and rented the correct film later. (And I recall enjoying both.)
In this case, rather than simply return the ebook and go on their merry way, both customers left one-star reviews.
In their reviews, the readers admitted they intended to buy the other book—the one on book club lists, the one written by a different author with a different name, the one that didn't say "erotic content," kinky, fetish, etc. (You can hear me losing my mind here because on the Amazon page, it actually states: "The story deals not only with rubber as a fetish, but with exhibitionism, voyeurism, and most important: longing.")
One reader simply wrote: NOT THE BOOK I WAS EXPECTING (over and over). The other explained that s/he had bought the title in error, and then complained that the story was short (not even a book!) and called my happy little kink story "cheap soft porn."
I stumbled on the reviews a while ago. (Years, maybe.) And every so often, I land on the thought in my mental travels. Sometimes I imagine walking into the wrong store—say, a shoe store—and being indignant because the place doesn't sell fish. ("I came in here wanting fresh salmon! How dare you sell shoes?") Then there's this bafflement I always feel when someone buys an item that states "24 pages, short story, 2775 words" and then bewails about the length. This mini skirt? It's not a maxi! These shorts are not pants! This shot of whiskey is *not* the whole bottle.
Seriously.
But this morning, I woke with an unexpected brainwave. Yes, yes, I have too many projects begun and not enough projects ended. I am writing on Figment every night and my cougar novel every day. I'm letting several sultry anthologies sizzle on all of my bunsen burners. But I started a new book today called Cheap Soft Porn.
And I'm ecstatic.
Lemons into lemonade?
No. A slap into a tickle.
That's far more my speed.

I Don't Want To, And You Can't Make Me.
I've spent almost my entire life doing what other people wanted me to do—with notable exceptions. I didn't marry the man everyone said I should marry. I didn't stay at the school everyone said I should stay at.
But generally, I'm a peace keeper, a team player, a good-time girl, a Jill of all trades, an olive-branch hander, a white-flag waver. I don't rock the boat. I won't shake the tree. I never spill the milk. I rattle nobody's cage.
I've been cajoled, badgered, bullied, bamboozled. (Love that word.) I take full responsibility. I thought that's what you were supposed to do. Be easy going. Be a yes man. Be a do-be not a don't-be.
This year, I've been working to make a difference. Small changes, perhaps, but notable to me:
I have broken bad habits. (Well, I'm working on breaking bad habits.)
I have tried to find my arc. (Look at me in the tree.)
I've searched for the positive (and fairies fucking in batteries).
And I've failed at all of that and broken down in public. (Like you do.)
But here's something I've been mulling over, kicking around, toying with... There are things you don't have to do if you don't want to. No, really. Look at your schedule. Check your lists. (Check them twice, if you want. 'Tis the season.) There are emails you don't have to answer. Phone calls you don't have to return. Groups you can not join. Boards you don't have to serve on. Cupcakes you don't have to bake. (If you're like me. And not a baker.) There are movies you don't have to watch, articles you don't have to read. Parties you don't have to attend.
I mean, that has to be a plus in the sea of negatives regarding aging.
Now, I'm not suggesting you should live in a cave with no human interaction. I'm simply saying this:
Do you want to fill-in-the-blank? No? Then don't.
In the past, I have been slammed into deadlines I knew were bad for me. I have been coerced into jobs I had no desire to do. Guilted into situations that felt unending and unrelenting.
Sure, there are things we can't get away from. (Taxes always comes up.) But I've jettisoned so much extra fluff, so many expectations weighing on me that were placed there by others, I am ending this year much lighter than when I started.
Surprisingly, I am becoming very good at not doing what I don't want to. You can no longer drag me by my wrist to an event I have no desire to attend. But the thing is, if you took me by the wrist into somewhere I wanted to go, I am there. I am yours. I am more than 1000% present. If we stood against the wall and watched the writhing bodies in the room, breathed in the heat and musk and raw scent of human sexuality, then, baby, I won't leave until they turn the lights on.
And I might not even leave then.
Because here's the unexpected and lovely flip side of not doing what you don't want to. You have so much more time to do what you want to do. Whether you spend yours at an orgy, or elsewhere, that's entirely up to you. (I want pictures.)

Sex Al Fresco
I am seriously thrilled by the photos I received this month. I challenged readers to snap pictures of my titles outside. Yes, my kinky books have an exhibitionism fetish! The images you sent are so beautiful! I believe these are all of the shots I received, but if I missed yours, drop me a reminder at msalisontyler at yahoo dot com. New photo contest at the bottom!
Photos this month were by Angell, Jim, Trix, Tristan, Sommer, and David. In my book, everyone's a winner. If you email me your snail mail address, I'll send a hard copy of one of my titles. Each month, I choose a winner for a major box of books plucked from my porn closet. This month's is a tie between Trix, who took Sticky Fingers to a hockey game, and Jim who said, "I'm considering a series entitled AT Meets the Phallic Symbols of Detroit." Love that!
For December, my challenge is to pose one of my titles with one of your collections. (Years and years ago, readers sent me pictures of everything from rubber ducks to stickers.) Do you collect tea cups? Watches? Calligraphy pens? I want to see them. Send your photo to msalisontyler at yahoo dot com by the end of December.
I'll be back with a new writing challenge shortly. I promise.

Rick laughed.
Last week's #1LineWed helped me in a totally unexpected way. The theme was #home, and I hadn't really taken stock of my novel up until then. I mean, I understood I was writing the different routes and roads the characters were on. The round-abouts. The ups and downs. I realized a lot of them were traveling. Moving from one spot to another. But I didn't grasp that the ultimate theme of the book was home.
All of my characters are—in one way or another—going home.
Somehow, that unlocked a missing part of the story for me. And I'm seriously grateful because things that hadn't made sense now do.
This week's #1LineWed theme is "laughter" or "humor." (Or "humour.") Apparently, there's not a lot of this in my book (thus far). Characters laugh all of twice. The first time: "Rick laughed." Seriously. Not a lot to work with.
Here's the second: She started crying because she was going to have sex with a stranger and if someone had told her a year ago that this would be her life she'd have laughed. She would have thought the conversation was crazy talk, like saying she'd suddenly become an astronaut.
I will be posting the entries for my "glitter" prompt this week, and also sliding up the gorgeous photos you sent. *And* I'll be teasing you with a new prompt and contest. Hopefully, tomorrow.
December just snuck up on me when I wasn't looking!

Second, I love this write-up for the pins:
To specify which designs you'd like, please write the text of the button you'd like as well as the number desired in the "note to seller" box during checkout. Example: Purchasing 3 for $12 "Boss Bitch (1), Fuck (1), Pussy (1)."
I mean, in this holiday season, how many times are you going to enter those words at checkout? I think the answer should be all the time. But I know it's not.
Moving on to the main point of my Monday posts. My Monday question... Which I'll start with this story. I have a friend who works retail. During the holiday season, people tend to... well, reach their limits. Some try to use my friend as therapy. You know that term "retail therapy"? Well, they cross the line to something else, pouring out all their problems, their worries, their worst nightmares as they pay for their purchases. Then there are those who are simply unconscionably rude. It's almost as if they feel that when they buy something they can also use the exchange to get rid of all their pent-up aggression. Kind of like, "Here's my ten dollars. And also, here's every bit of nasty fiber I've been saving up all day, Bitch."
So I asked her how she remains polite—or at least doesn't devolve into a raving lunatic—during the season. Her mantra is Stay Calm. Really. She repeats that over and over. She also doesn't take people's attitude. Although polite, she refuses to engage with the hateful hordes.
I have witnessed the way people treat her. And honestly? I would cry.
Which takes us to our question. How do you do it? How do you Stay Calm during the holidays? Do you have a trick? Do you have tequila? Do you have a Tardis?
XXX,
Alison

Trollop with a Question
November 29, 2015
Trollop on the Dark Side
I wasn't entirely sure how to do my gift guides this year. One idea was to split the guides by dollar amount, which I've done in the past. Another was to divide by theme, which I've also done. So then I thought, why not merge the two? Here is the first of (I don't know how) many gift guides I plan to put up between now and the holidays.
What's the theme? Star Wars.
Why? Because I am helpless in the face of Star Wars items. I adore them. I have the Star Wars Pez ($19.40) I own a Star Wars light saber key ($11.85). I am wearing a Star Wars bandage ($2.78) on my finger right this second.
So, with a range of prices for your purchasing pleasure, here are some of the Star Wars items I want for Christmas. Wait, what did I just write? Back that up. I mean, here are some of the lovely gifts you can buy for the Star Wars fan in your life. (Who I hope is me.)
First are pencils by one of my all-time favorite Etsy artists, The Carbon Crusader. The "Yoda Speak" pencils cost only $4.00, while these fabulous Star Wars pencils cost $8.00. (For office gifts, you could buy a set, divide them, and tie each one with a ribbon.)
I'm sitting in my office in the wee hours of the morning laughing quietly to myself over this one. Wookie Cookies. I'm betting this cookbook will be a hit with David! This hardcover Star Wars cookbook costs $11.01. (This reminds me that I never finished my post on Wookie Nookie. I'll have to get back to that.)
Up Shirts Creek has created three different Star Wars-inspired t-shirts: Stop Wars, May the (m x a) Be With You, and (my personal favorite) Come to the Dork Side... The tees are $14.99 each.
For $21.95, you can have your very own Death Star tea infuser. I mean, you can buy one for a friend. You didn't think I meant you should buy one for yourself, right? This is a gift guide. Meaning, a guide of gifts to buy people who deserve them. But, of course, you deserve gifts, too. And it's only $21.95. And how can you resist?
The Star Wars Snowflight sweater is on sale for $29.99 (down from $60). And I want it because this would be perfect to wear with my Darth Vader Vans. (You have to select DarkSide/Darth Vader from the pulldown menu, which I fucking love. The price varies with Vans.)
Rooby Lane offers several different Star Wars items in a range of prices. I own her R2D2 scarf ($27.80), and I covet her Storm Trooper cushion covers ($30.89). But honestly, her "special event storm trooper dress" is the item that would make me squee if I found it under the tree! (That was an unintentional rhyme. Trust me.) We'll slip that into the luxury list at $193.05.
As I travel through time and space this season, I will probably add more gadgets and gizmos to the list. Feel free to make your own suggestions. But this is my starting place, from $2.78 to $193.05—odder numbers you won't find on most other lists!
Awesome, you are.
XXX,
Alison

Thank you!
I've been telling stories for twenty-five years. Long before you could select smut at your local supermarket, my fingers slid sensuously over my typewriter keys. (Yes, typewriter!) Late at night, and long before dawn, I would pound out the words I heard in my head.I'm thrilled that the characters are still whispering to me. And I'm beyond grateful for the readers who want to hear what they have to say.XXX,Alison

About Me
Alison Tyler
According to the East Bay Literary Examiner, I am "Erotica's Own Superwoman." I've also been called a "literary siren" by Good Vibrations, "the mistress of literary erotica" by Violet Blue, and a "Trollop with a Laptop" by East Bay Express. Ever the voyeur, I'm obsessed with learning about other people's secrets, fantasies, and turn-ons, which makes me perfect for my job as Contributing Editor to Penthouse Variations. Are *you* ready to share?
