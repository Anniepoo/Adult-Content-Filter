Modern society, bisexual becomes more and more, perhaps say, as a new human concept is more and more open, there are more and more bisexual choose out, with the development of bisexual, a growing number of bisexual people choose out, some bisexual bar, bisexual dating sites began to emerge. Bisexual group experience gradually strong, one day, bisexual are all approved, accepted.

“Bisexual women get energy from other women and then turn around and put that energy into working out their relationships with men”
Can anyone even explain what this means? What is this “energy”??
Bi women perform seances to absorb the youth of past wlw which they use to appear more attractive to men
A bi woman once absorbed all my energy and i couldnt help goku form a spirit bomb
But it’s a huge hassle, handling your Dark Bisexual Powers.  Especially when you’re new to it all.  Like, say you date five girls in a week.  That gets you at least ten (10) POWER ORBS.  You store them in your body and if you’re not careful they’re released whenever you come into contact with any man.
I’m just saying that when I was thirteen, I shook a guy’s hand and he exploded.

it’s no wonder people don’t understand bisexuality and pansexuality when they don’t even understand liking both star wars and star trek
