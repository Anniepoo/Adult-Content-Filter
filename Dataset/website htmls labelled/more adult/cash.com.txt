Money makes the world go round; whether we like it or not, it’s a fact.
Though money cannot buy happiness, financial struggles can cause severe hardships that can only be solved with more cash; after all, having a great outlook on life and generous attitude can’t pay your rent. Money alone cannot complete us, but having the financial stability to be able to pay your bills, have a sufficient savings, rid yourself of suffocating debt, send your children to college, and maybe have some leftover funds for some fun in the sun is priceless.
