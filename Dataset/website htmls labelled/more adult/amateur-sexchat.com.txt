Testimonials
I have been a vendor for Silk for approximately 5 years. They are easy to work with, knowledgeable, professional, and, most importantly, they understand the value of getting it right the first time. K.B., Attorney
Silk Abstract has been our primary title provider for REO transactions across the United States for over 10 years. Silk has consistently provided fast and reliable title searches, commitments, and other deliverables, and often go above and beyond to ensure curative matters are addressed and remedied expeditiously. B.C., REO Operations Manager
Silk Title is always a pleasure to work with! The staff is friendly, helpful and always available to answer any questions that may arise! The documents arrive on time, if not early, and payment is always processed in timely manner. G.K., Closing Agent
Our company provides collateral retrieval and closing services for mortgage lenders in their completion of bulk mortgage loan sales. After examining the market for competent assistance, we have worked exclusively with Silk Abstract Company for a significant period of time as our primary title policy and collateral retrieval vendor to facilitate the closing of these sales, and with good reason. J.A., Lender Services Operations Manager
We have partnered with Silk Title for nearly a decade. Over the years, we have been able to develop strong, lasting relationships with management and staff alike. We are always able to bring any questions or concerns we have to them and have them addressed in a timely manner D.S., Principal Abstract Firm
I have been working with Silk Abstract Company since 2007 and with each passing year, the level of service has been exemplary that far exceeds other title agencies that I have worked with. I deal with many members of their staff on a daily basis and it is always refreshing to know that I can count on their promptness and knowledge on any particular matter that we are dealing with. S.S., Attorney
The team at Silk Abstract Company is wonderful to work with. We had a "difficult" file to get through and they were troopers, seeing it through to the end. Their diligence to detail and accuracy insured a great closing! S.B., Real Estate Broker
I would be happy to relate my experience with Silk. Lance, Ron and their team were all very helpful in the closing of my father's condo in Florida. Everyone was very helpful in explaining all the necessary steps that had to be followed to ensure a smooth closing. S.P., Seller
Silk Abstract was consistent, reliable and prompt. I felt I was updated from start to finish and appreciated that they kept the lines of communication open at all times. Silk went above and beyond to get the deal done on time. C.W., Real Estate Sales Agent
