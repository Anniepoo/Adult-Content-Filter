Always.
Okay. How about this? EVERY LIFE MATTERS TO ME!!!!
But that’s not the point here. Yes, every life matters, but Muslim lives go through a lot especially with islamophobia. Not every person goes through the problems that Islamic people have. This post was for recognizing them.
Okay. Understandable. I’d rather not be one of those douchebags on tumblr.
Thank you!
See what happens tumblr when we don’t freak out and drag the person in the wrong?
