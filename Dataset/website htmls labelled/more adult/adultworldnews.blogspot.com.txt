Pierre Woodman Continues Legendary Woodman Casting X Series
Woodman Entertainment, the innovative new adult entertainment brand dedicated to delivering a unique combination of high class, uncompromised hardcore content across all available delivery platforms, announces the continuation of Pierre Woodman's legendary Casting X series.The success of Pierre Woodman's Casting X formula is obvious from the desperate attempts that have been made by competitors to try and copy it. Many have tried to fake it, but none have succeeded for the simple reason that there is only one true Casting X, from the man who invented it - Pierre Woodman.Set to go on release in June, the legendary series reaches its 75th edition with the first release under the Woodman Entertainment brand. As always the series will feature the unique Pierre Woodman formula of interviews and hardcore castings as wannabe porn actresses take their very first tentative steps in the world of porn with their very first taste of sex on camera.Woodman Casting X 75 will feature Kety Bleins, Lulu, Lorena Blond, Kaoruko, Moana, Renata, Mona Lee and Xenia Love, all exclusively in their very first on-film fuck.Pierre Woodman said: "I am delighted to reintroduce my Casting X series. It has long been a trademark of mine, and there has been overwhelming demand for it to return. It seems that although similar products have come onto the market, in fact more than 50 last time I counted, to judge by all the comments that I have read in web forums I have realised that what people really want to see is the original.It is wonderful to know that porn fans demand the original and true Casting X, but to get it is not so easy, the key is to get the girls first and this is what I do most of the time. I smile when I see what some of my competitors claim on their box covers, first time appearance, never been shot before, etc... but there is only one real casting line and I have been proving it for the last 16 years."

Digital Playground's Stoya Featured in Contest on XCritic.com
Stoya, one of Digital Playground's premiere contract stars, is the focus of a new online competition by XCritic.com. The entry form can be completed on XCritic.com's website. The grand prize winner receives autographed copies of every film that Stoya has appeared in for Digital Playground: "Cheerleaders", "Stoya: Video Nasty", "Jack's POV 9", "Stoya: Sexual Freak", and "Jesse Jane: Lust". Four runner-ups receive an autographed copy of "Stoya: Video Nasty". Stoya is one of the hardest working, fresh talents in the industry. In addition to the quality movies she films for Digital Playground, she maintains an entertaining and personal blog for XCritic.com. Geoffrey Kleinman, XCritic.com CEO, realized Stoya's potential right away: "People in the industry throw around the term 'girl next door' so much, but in the case of Stoya, it's absolutely true. I knew she was destined to become a huge star the moment I saw her, but it wasn't until we spoke that I realized the real extent of her talent. Stoya is a smart girl and somehow manages to combine a sweet innocence with a major sex drive. It was only natural for us to showcase her talents on XCritic.com, so our readers can also experience the world of Stoya." The contest is XCritic.com's way of paying homage to one of the industry's biggest stars and the company she heralds from.Signed to an exclusive contract with Digital Playground in 2007, Stoya became a quick favorite among critics and fans alike. Her carefree personality translates well in her on-camera sex scenes. Digital Playground is a throw-back to the old Hollywood studio system, where contract stars are able to develop relationships with Digital Playground's award winning producers, directors, and other talent. Samantha Lewis, Digital Playground CEO, describes the studio as "a family. When you work so closely with the same people, you begin to understand their strengths and talents. We develop strong bonds with our actors that make for better films." For Digital Playground, the goal is always to provide better quality films for their audience.

Bianca Trump is in jail - and seeking pen pals!
Former pornstar, and until recently a White Supremacist, Bianca Trump is now in prison, seeking pen pals. Click the image for her pen pal page, with her picture on it and everything. I am puzzled as to why she mentioned God on her pen pal ad, because last I heard she was a practicing Satanist or practicer of voodoo or witchcraft, and it was rumored that she has a tattoo of a pentagram somewhere on her body… maybe on her upper back or back of her neck, under her hair. Here is what her ad says:"I consider myself to be educated, honest, & loyal. I’ve never been accused of being boring. According to the numbers I’m 34, but I look and feel 24. No abusive substances have been added. I’m a professional tattooist, so all my ink is a hazard of the trade. My tattoos are an outward expression of my life story. I have no children, but I have 100’s of Crested Geckos that I breed and sell nationally. I’m also a self proclaimed Harley Davidson fanatic. There’s no where I won’t go on a hog! I love tattoo conventions, reptile shows, old cars & car shows, rockabilly, pin up girls, swing dancing, & concerts (anything from country to hatecore - no rap!) The natural order of things in my life is God first, family second, everything else comes after. You’ve got to live for something, or you’ll die for nothing! Please be like minded & send sincere responses. Photos are a plus.Wendy Iwanow # 301483P L C C W 2C12CP O Box 300Medical Lake, WA 99022 USA

Belladonna Joins Digital Playground's Jesse Jane and an All-Star Cast for "Pirates II"
In an exciting announcement, Digital Playground's Samantha Lewis and Joone announced that internationally renowned adult film sensation, Belladonna will star in "Pirates II: Stagnetti's Revenge." The much-anticipated feature film is currently in production and slated for release in September 2008.Joone, Digital Playground Founder and award-winning director states, "Having such incredible talent as Belladonna star in 'Pirates II' confirms the magnitude of just how large this production is. We never would have agreed to anyone less than extraordinary and Belladonna is at the top of that list. The scene today with Belladonna and Jesse Jane set the level of what 'Pirates II' is going to be."Belladonna comments, "I want everyone to know that Jesse Jane sets the standard for contract girls. She went above and beyond what most girls do and she gave me a run for my money. Everything together was so intense and having Joone's direction made it so much more intense. When Jesse said, 'you can do whatever you want to me,' it made my day. There are too many great moments in the scene to count... this couldn't have been a better day."Jesse Jane comments, "You cannot fake what happened. It was a long day and it was such a build up, and what came with the build up was all this sexual tension. During this scene it was a half and half battle. Bella had control half of the time and I had to struggle to get it back. Bella is the first girl that literally made me struggle and is the first girl that has ever dominated me. It was on from the word go and Bella simply rocked me. She changed my world."Samantha Lewis, Digital Playground CEO remarks, "Belladonna is by far one of the industry's most exciting, talented and accomplished performers. Having Belladonna attached to 'Pirates II' enhances the overall production value, complements the incredible star power, and gives Belladonna the opportunity to share another incredible film with her fans. 'Pirates II' will far surpass everyone's expectations."Digital Playground contract superstar Jesse Jane returns as renowned pirate hunter and first-mate Jules. New additions to the "Pirates II" cast include Belladonna and Digital Playground contract stars: Shay Jordan, Stoya, Katsuni and Riley Steele. Evan Stone returns as rogue pirate hunter Capt. Edward Reynolds, and reprising his role as renegade pirate Capt. Victor Stagnetti is Tommy Gunn. Directed by Joone, and produced by Samantha Lewis and Joone, the film will be released by Digital Playground throughout the world in September 2008."Pirates" was hailed as the largest epic in the history of adult films. The most expensive adult effort yet produced, the feature was lauded with awards from every associated panel, notably a record-breaking 14 from AVN to date, including Best Selling and Best Renting title honors. Building upon the success of the film within its traditional market, the studio received an additional R-rating from the Motion Picture Association of America, thus gaining mainstream recognition and distribution, making a theatrical release of a "Pirates" sequel imminent.The "Pirates" web site with teaser trailer of "Pirates II" can be viewed in full HD at www.PiratesXXX.com

HALO PARK comes with the best erotica ever!
No, I don't mean "Debbie Does Dallas", "Deep Throat" and all those classics that are so mainstream, they're now blasé. I mean REAL classics from the Golden Age or Erotica.One of the first titles to come from the company is 1976's Blow Dry, an XXX-rated take on "Shampoo". This big-budget artsy New York comedy, directed by Joey Vincent under the alias "Laser Scepter", tells the story of Warren Peece (Pepe Valentine, a.k.a. Michael King), an ambitious, virile hairdresser with dreams of opening his own salon, who sleeps his way to the top (and the bottom) on his way there.Cast includes Helen Madigan (a.k.a. Jennifer Mason), Crystal Sync (a.k.a. Petula Smith) and oriental Peonies Jong, Jamie Gillis and the legendary R. Bolla (who also provides an excellent commentary track).The other title is 1985's Emmanuelle Goes to Cannes (or "The Elementary Stud", one of their less lawsuit-prone titles), a french comedy directed by Jean-Marie Pallardy and starring the Marilyn Monroe lookalike Olinka Hardiman as the title character.In this one, Emmanuelle dreams of being a movie star. In reality, she works as a stripper in a sleazy nightclub where she is forced by her manager and boyfriend Frank to sleep with the wealthy clients. When she catches him inflagranti with a colleague, she finally summons up the courage to run away in the hope of making her dream come true.At the Cannes film festival, she meets a movie producer. Though he's more interested in her body than her acting skills, he gives her a leading role in a cheap porn movie, which is a box-office flop. Left alone and unable to pay her bills she prostitutes herself until Frank finally arrives and pulls her out of her despair. Cast also includes Zeta Whitehouse, Paola Farrow, Glynis Whitman and the omnipresent Gabriel Pontello.Other titles you can expect from Halo Park are Naked and Lustful (La Donneuse, 1975), another Pallardy delicacy starring Beba Loncar, and Confessions of a Teenage Peanut Butter Freak (1976), directed by Zachary Strong (as "Gerald Graystone") and starring
Helen Madison again (this time as "Jennifer Mason"), Constance Money, Sharon Taylor and über-stud John Holmes. Wait and see, it will be worthy.

Ashley Licks Underage? - NOT!
Ashley Licks, who performed in a few dozen black-themed titles in 2006, is sending around e-mails to several online retail sites containing the following:I was under 18 at the time and used fake id which I am in a legal case suing right now. Please remove me from this site asap.Everyone seems to think the underage claim is a bluff, and she just wants to cover up her porn past. What exactly is she suing for? Doesn't sound like much of a civil case. She might want to talk to Traci Lords and Alexandria Quinn about the fact she is shit out of luck. Another asshole trying to make an easy buck.Now that the porn industry is in crisis and companies don't shoot very often, some porn whores are out there to rip off people by stupid claims of being underage, being manipulated, being fucked over, etc. It's all because the phones had stopped ringing. It turns out some of these whores are dumber than we thought; but the sad truth is that American people are even dumber, and the minute some $2.00 crack whore cries rape, they believe her and show sympathy and side with her. Ignorance is without fault.No one has removed her from their sites as of yet.UPDATE FROM LUKEISBACK.COM:I work in 2257 compliance for a major adult company and have an Ashley Licks ID on file. It is a New York state ID, name is Okiella Lord. It looks to be a legitimate ID and I would send you a copy but naturally I have concerns about doing so, particularly since I am new to your site and not that familiar with it. I think your assertion that she is trying to cover up her porn past sounds more likely.(Anyhoo, Luke being Luke, he managed to get a copy of the damn ID anyway. Here it is, click to enlarge).

Woodman's THE PERFECTIONIST to be released October
Woodman Entertainment, the innovative new adult entertainment brand dedicated to delivering a unique combination of high class, uncompromised hardcore content across all available delivery platforms, confirms that part 1 of Pierre Woodman's latest blockbuster hardcore trilogy, "The Perfectionist" will go on general release in October 2007.This sensational sex thriller delivers a luxurious combination of gorgeous women, danger and devastatingly hard sex. The trilogy, shot on location in the Czech Republic and Brazil, features a star studded cast of 34 girls (with many first-timers performing their first on screen anal in the capable hands of Pierre Woodman) including our exclusive contract girls Divinity Love and Nessa Devil. "The Perfectionist" takes us into a fast moving world where glamour, gangsters and guns coexist and features, for the very first time in a porn movie, the phenomenal Ferrari 599 GTB.In Part 1 of this tempestuous tale packed with action, suspense and hardcore sex, Divinity and Nessa are joined by a cast of 16 cock-craving chicks including Nella, Theodora Ferreri, Eve Angel, Mili Jay, Hannah Hunter, Mercedezs, Peaches, Bambi, and Druuna Diva. These sensuous sluts are all licensed to thrill and know just how to handle even the most formidable weapon they may encounter!Pierre Woodman said:"I am thrilled with the finished product. Now that we have finished editing, the movie is even better than I had hoped. It captures exactly the atmosphere that I have had in my mind ever since the project was conceived. Like always, ever since I started in this business, I have concentrated my efforts on the cast and when you see the line up on the box cover you will understand why we stand apart from the competition in terms of the most gorgeous new and exclusive faces. Furthermore, I would not be exaggerating if I said that I consider this to be one of my most elaborate productions ever with a plotline and dramatic sequences in the style of a regular TV series. Sometimes it pays to be a perfectionist!"

Psst Hilary Duff, I can see your vagina
Hilary Duff performed in Anaheim, California late last week wearing some really short shorts without underwear and I think she flashed the audience. I can’t be too sure if what I’m seeing is a vagina or a trick of light or just really gripping underwear. I only have these medical books to go off of ever since my neighbor canceled his Playboy subscription. It’s really hard to tell when things aren’t labeled properly. Anyway, just pretend this is Hilary Duff’s vagina. For future reference, when you’re performing on stage and everyone is looking up at you, it’s probably a good idea to invest in some panties. Also, my text book says she should watch out for yeast infections. Those things are gross.Click here for the hiper-mega-res vagina pic.

FEDS' PORN ULTIMATUM
Ron Jeremy, Jenna Jameson - get ready to stand and be counted. The Department of Justice wants to come up with an official list of every porn star in America - and slap stiff penalties on producers who don't cooperate.The new rules, proposed under the Adam Walsh Child Safety and Protection Act, would require blue-movie makers to keep photos, stage names, professional names, maiden names, aliases, nicknames and ages on file for the inspection of the department's Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section."The identity of every performer is critical to determining and ensuring that no performer is a minor," according to the new proposal.The adult film industry plans to challenge the new rule as a violation of the First Amendment, said Paul Cambria, a lawyer for Hustler and other adult film companies. He sees it as a way to harass legitimate stag-film producers."If they can't get you for obscenity, they'll get you for violating record-keeping," he said. Such a violation would carry a five-year penalty. The proposed rule would require porn producers to give the title of the video or magazine, or the Web address where the actor appears.The Department of Justice has shown some sensitivity for the performers' privacy, however. All information not essential to proving their age and identity, like phone numbers and addresses, can be withheld.Distributors of foreign pornography aren't off the hook - they must still produce a copy of the foreign actor's identification card. The department estimates that there are 500,000 Web sites, 200 DVD producers and 5,000 businesses nationwide that would be subject to the new rule.The department did not respond to requests for comment, but in its proposal suggested that the benefits outweighed any negative impact on the porn industry."The benefit of the rule is that children will be better protected from exploitation in the production of visual depictions of sexually explicit conduct by ensuring that only those who are at least 18 years of age perform in such depictions. The costs to the industry include slightly higher record-keeping costs," the agency argued.+++So when do they start giving out the numbered tattoos?
