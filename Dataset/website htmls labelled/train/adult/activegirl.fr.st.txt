Workable Fitness Goals and Better Job Performance
LEARN MORE »
This 10-week program encourages employees to be more active on a regular basis by setting individual goals and forming teams for motivation and support.Since everyone’s different, participants set their own goals based on how active they are, and how active they want to be. Personal goals can be moderate (like walking or yard work or taking the stairs) or more intense (like running or tennis).Participants receive a point for each minute they are active daily and record the number of points they earn toward their total point goal. This helps people keep track of their progress, and they are then rewarded for working toward their goals.Each participant also belongs to a team. Teammates encourage and motivate each other, and teams are rewarded as members make progress toward their goals.
