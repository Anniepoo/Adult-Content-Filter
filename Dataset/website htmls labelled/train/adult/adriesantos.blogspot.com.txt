Miss me?
Bad, bad blogger! I know.
It's been ages and while I have been enjoying life as a good ol' fashion freelance writer under my "regular" writing name, I am missing my erotica and my work as Adrie Santos, sex writer and author of erotic fiction. So what am I doing about it? Well, for starters I have given up my mission to get back my old domain and am in the process of becoming a dot CA instead of a dot Com. (A big FUCK YOU to the shysters at Enom and Namejet.com for holding my domain ransom for a RIDICULOUS amount!!). With the new domain there will also be a new design, along with some new work to share with the smut-meisters who have remained loyal all of these years and hopefully some new ones.
I have been on a mini-break from writing for personal reasons and will hopefully be back at it soon, but anticipate the changes to this site to happen shortly since working on it seems to be helping with my nerves. In the meantime my little sex tips guide is available for download on Kindle for only $2.99 if you're looking for a no fuss no muss guide to amazing sex featuring some very easy, yet oh-so-yummy tricks. No expensive props or products required! Find it on my Amazon author page or via the link below.

Please mind the mess...
There's a new design on the way since I am having to deal with my domain issues anyway--why not clean house and start fresh, right?
Check back soon for a new look and new content.
Those who have tried to reach me or would like to, please note that the domain change has also interfered with my email service. Please reach me instead at adriexsantos@aol.com

Your Fantasies
The past couple of years have been slow for me as far as my writing erotic fiction goes. It's not a lack of opportunities so much as a lack of time thanks to other projects that have been keeping me busy and leaving me a little drained in the dirty creativity department. As it turns out; my mind isn't "always in the gutter" as it is so often accused of being! Anyhow, I am making the conscious effort to set aside more time for erotic fiction since it is something I not only enjoy but have been told I'm good at. *Grin*
I'm taking to my blog and specifically to my readers for inspiration. I feel like everything I am coming up with has been done a billion times over and am looking for a little creative nudge. To be clear: I'm not looking for your penis pics or yet another email about the things you long to do to me. Thanks but no thanks. What I am however interested in is your fantasies or experiences or even a fuzzy memory that makes you feel durdy--I'll take it all. Is there something that you've seen or heard that sends your mind and loins racing? Perhaps you find yourself often fantasizing about something that you haven't seen written about elsewhere that would make a great story? I'm not looking to steal ideas or stories -- just lookin' for a much needed jumping point.

Looking forward to hearing what gets you off!! ;)

Glowing Reviews by People I Didn't Have to Pay
"Newsflash: Women like to get fucked without the romantic entanglement just as much as the next guy!I really wish I had written this, but I feel it my duty to send you over to Girlspoke where Adrie has written a masterpiece on the subject of casual sex. When you get over there, just scroll down & enjoy. Men, get your mind right!"By Paula D. at Ghetto Economics-----------------------------------------------------------------"I've been reading this for a few weeks now, and Girlspoke is really awesome. It's kind of a mix between Sex and the City and The Golden Girls and Charlie's Angels. Here's their catch line: "Girlspoke is an all female team blog written by some of the funniest smartest ladies on the web..."Check it out.
And my favorite writer over there is Adrie."-MikeJ at Jones of the Nile---------------------------------------------------------------"I found Adrie Santos's blog while on patrol for sexy images of naked bodies and chocolate pie. (That's Adrie in the pic, not me.) I didn't actually turn her site, "The Accidental Sex Writer" up while Googling for those things, but when I stumbled on her, I had to pass along the funniest blog entry I've read all day. Earlier this month, Adrie wrote about her site being hijacked by spammers, but these were no ordinary annoying dorks. No, these spammers were hyping bible studies. I suppose the bible spammers thought they were doing God's (or whoever) work by hijacking a site that promotes healthy, fun, and natural interaction between consenting adults, but in the process they gave her a lot of grief. And me a lot of laughs, so maybe it was worth something for her trouble. Thanks, Adrie, for sharing this story. You made my day, so I think I need to add you to the growing list of bloggers I've fallen in love with. The Blue Android gives you a brief-but-hot lipsticky kiss."By Vyvian at Blue Android----------------------------------------------------------------
