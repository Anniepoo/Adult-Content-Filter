About Collotype
Established in Kyoto in 1905, the Benrido Collotype Atelier brings over a century of experience to image- making. Collotype printing was the state of the art for photographic reproduction at the turn of the twentieth century. However, due to the high level of expertise needed to obtain consistent results, it was quickly replaced by the faster, cheaper, more mechanized process of offset printing. As one of the world’s few remaining producers of collotypes, Benrido offers rare access to this lost craft, providing opportunities for today’s photographers to collaborate with master artisan printers in making singularly beautiful museum-quality prints for exhibition and display.
True Continuous Tone
One of the collotype’s distinguishing characteristics is the ability to display extremely fine tonal gradations and a practically infinite range of values. By approximating the full array of perceptible tones—from deep shadow to brilliant highlight—collotype prints faithfully render photographic images in exquisite detail.
Rich Pigment Ink
Collotypes are made with opaque, oil-based pigment inks that are formulated to be maximally lightfast for enduring archival prints. These pigment inks bond to the paper’s surface, and can be meticulously layered by skillful printers to create luscious images of unmatched richness and depth.
Distinctive Surfaces
While typical photographic prints are necessarily produced on machine-made papers with a limited range of textures and weights, the collotype process may be applied to a wide variety of fine-art substrates. Benrido’s expert pressmen can print on handmade papers and textiles made from various fibers, including cotton, linen, silk, rice, and vellum—providing artists with extraordinary latitude in the selection of materials.
Fine Art within Reach
In the age of digital reproduction, the irregularities that result from this analog process imbue each impression with the singular quality of a handmade work of art. Because editions of up to several hundred are possible, collotypes are accessible to collectors whose means may prevent them from investing in extremely rare prints.

History
Established in the heyday of collotype printing over a century ago, the Benrido Atelier is one of only a handful of remaining collotype studios.
Collotype Process
Collotypes originated in France in the early decades of photography. In 1855 the Frenchman Alphonse- Louis Poitevin discovered the hardening effect of light on metallic salts suspended in gelatin. On the basis of this discovery, he developed a process of printing continuous-tone photographs using pigment ink. In the decades that followed, collotype technology was modified and improved as various innovators experimented with chemical formulas and developed hybrid processes and multi-color variants. The advent of collotypes made possible the distribution of photographs in books, and the process quickly became the European standard for commercial photo reproduction.
Benrido Atelier
In the 1880s, the process was exported from Europe to such distant locales as the ancient Japanese city of Kyoto. By 1905, Benrido had begun producing collotypes, thereby inaugurating what was to become a distinctive legacy in printmaking. Along with local papermakers and bookbinders, the Benrido craftsmen have upheld a tradition of superior Kyoto artisanship for more than a century, creating and preserving thousands of Japanese national treasures and cultural artifacts. Now that new technologies have all but driven collotypes to extinction, the Benrido studio provides photographers of the digital age with a unique opportunity to realize their creative visions using this rare process.
Behind the Scenes
Watch this short documentary featuring Tate Modern’s curator Simon Baker and Benrido’s master printer Osamu Yamamoto to learn more about the distinctive features of collotype prints, the history of the process, and the forward-looking innovations Benrido has developed to preserve this traditional analog craft in the age of digital imaging.
Process
Benrido’s collotype technique combines digital imaging, photochemical processing, and pigment printmaking to produce remarkably rich, finely detailed images of the highest quality.
Fine Detail
Collotypes are printed from plates prepared using a photochemical process. First, a glass plate is coated with bichromated gelatin, dried, and exposed to light under a negative. Then the plate is washed, causing the gelatin to swell and harden in proportion to the degree of exposure. As it hardens, the gelatin reticulates into the collotype’s hallmark pattern of microscopic wrinkles. This extremely fine natural reticulation renders the photographic image in continuous tones, distinguishing collotypes from prints made using today’s typical halftone processes. Continuous tone images like collotypes may display a practically infinite range of tonal values to reproduce extremely fine detail.
Pigment Inks
Collotypes are made by applying pigmented oil-based ink to paper or other media using a lithographic printing process. Such a process depends on the mutual repulsion of water and oil: the hardened areas of the plate accept ink in the shadow areas, while the unhardened gelatin repels ink in the highlights. Hand- operated presses transfer the pigment ink from plate to paper, where it bonds to the surface to produce remarkably dense shadow tones. Because each ink color is mixed to match the artist’s specifications, the Benrido printers can produce hues that are impossible to achieve using standard CMYK printing.
Color Printing
Benrido is the world’s only producer of full-color collotype prints. Collotypes may produce color in a variety of ways. For many years the process has been used to combine spot colors for a graphic effect similar to that of woodblock printing. More recently, the Benrido Atelier has developed a method of using color separations to produce full-color photographic collotypes. The full-color collotype printing technique may also be applied to produce subtly colored duotone, tritone or quadtone images, as multiple layers of ink may be combined.
Digital Negatives
Benrido provides today’s artists with a unique printing process that combines time-tested artisanship with the newest technology. As increasing numbers of photographers shoot and edit digitally, the Benrido printers now print collotypes from digital files. Prepress technicians output digital negatives to acetate film that is used to produce collotype plates for printing. Because negatives are produced from digital files, artists can easily send their images electronically to Benrido from anywhere in the world.
Expertise Beyond Collotype
Benrido’s portfolios incorporate multiple materials and techniques. The combination of various crafts accentuates the distinctive artisanal aspects of each, yielding an art object that is greater than the sum of its parts.
True Mixed Media Artists working with the Benrido Atelier have access to vast printing expertise that extends beyond the collotype process. Our master artisans are adept at combining collotypes with silkscreen, offset, and letterpress to enhance the distinctive qualities of each printing technique.
Thorough Understanding of Paper A nuanced understanding not only of commercial paper, but also of fine handmade washi, enables Benrido's printers to make individualized substrate recommendations, helping each artist achieve the most effective results for his or her project.
Variety of Finishing Options As a member of the well-established community of Kyoto artisans, the Benrido Atelier is connected to a network of workshops offering hand binding, foil stamping, metal leafing, die-cutting, and other finishing services.
Comparison Chart
Collotypes occupy a unique position between mass-produced photo reproductions and prohibitely expensive one-of-a-kind original works of art. The collotype process is ideal for producing small editions of museum-quality photographic prints for fine art collectors.

I’d imagine there are very few places in the world where this is still possible.
Simon Baker, Curator of Photography and International Art, Tate Modern
In times like these, this it is very important that historical things are preserved. Benrido is probably the only place that can still achieve that.
