Common Dart Questions
What size soft-tips do I need?
There are two sizes of tips 2ba and 1/4". 2ba is the metric 3/16" unit of measure. 2ba is by far the most common size of soft tips.
Are the dart flights and dart shafts sold in sets of three?
Yes, all of our darts, dart flights, and dart shafts are sold in sets of three, unless otherwise noted.
What advantage is there for Tungsten Barrels?
Tungsten is a more dense metal than brass, so tungsten barrels will weigh more than brass barrels of the same size. Tungsten darts have a smaller diameter than brass darts which allows them to be grouped closer together on the board. Tungsten is also more durable than brass, so the knurling will last longer on tungsten darts compared to brass or nickel-silver. Most tungsten barrels are made with 80-90% tungsten. The higher the percent the smaller the diameter will be, compared to other darts of the same weight.
What advantage is there for movable points on darts?
Movable points are designed to absorb some of the shock when the dart hits the board or wire. This reduces the number of bounce-outs. Our most popular movable point darts are the Bottelsen Hammerhead Darts and the LaserDarts Black Widows. Movable points are a matter of preference some players prefer fixed point darts.
