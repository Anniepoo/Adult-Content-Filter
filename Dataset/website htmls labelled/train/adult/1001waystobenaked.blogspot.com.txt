Advice
Be kinder than necessary. Because everyone you meet is fighting some sort of battle.

Beginning
Ugh...
I don't even know where to begin.
After three four failed attempts at maintaining a blog, I'm trying again. I don't expect anyone to read this; my only goal is for this to be a form of therapy for me.
Therapy for what?
The answer to that is rather complex. For the sake of your patience and mine, I'll sum it up in two words: My unhappiness.
This is probably the point where I should introduce myself and lay out some background information. My name is not Contessa, but I'd like to pretend it is. (My mother created my real name by combining two she liked into one. Whereas she loves it, I've always hated it - the story of our relationship.) I'm inching closer to my 30th birthday. I have three children, aged 9 (girl) and 4 (twin boys). I am divorced. I live in Wisconsin with my boyfriend of four years. I work full time. If you're wondering, my unhappiness stems from childhood abandonment, low self esteem, and a general feeling of lack of control in my life.
As a result, my relationships are a mess, and that sort of trickles down to everything else.
More later.
