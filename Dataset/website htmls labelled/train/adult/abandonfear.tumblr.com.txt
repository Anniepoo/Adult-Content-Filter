Abandon Fear
Each of these slaves are prohibited from touching its body without permission. This means that each one must perform the daily grooming of the other for them. From washing, shaving, brushing, to makeup, and style each does its best to present the other to Master in a pleasing way.
These two were recently purchased from a local Master that specializes in training pairs of slaves as sisters. Due to this unique type of training they are especially effective when used as together, seamlessly blending into an obedient group of six holes.(via slavetrainings)
I love tying a slave’s arms in this exact position because of the way it tightens up the chest and forces the breasts outward. Seems to me that impact toys on the breasts take a bigger toll in this position as well. Now you just need to spread the legs and fuck until full. Sometimes simpler is better.(Source: brokencunts, via imarumblr)
I’ve been thinking about head shaving a lot recently. There is no denying the emotional impact of doing this to your slave. A slave’s hair style has a large impact on their overall appearance. Removing it from one, especially a female, makes it appear almost gender neutral. Certainly one step closer to an object, and not the sexy little slave girl it imagined it was.
Now you can truly dress your slave like a doll, a new wig each day, perhaps with a new personality to match. Then strip it of clothing and hair at home, reminding it of its true place.
Thing is, I love hair on a slave. Brushing it, binding it with ropes, yanking on it while fucking. It is so useful I’m not sure I could do without it. Maybe save the shaved heads for a second slave, or a pet.(Source: wolli6, via imarumblr)

On Waiting.
I have written often about the mind fuck of BDSM.  Give me a strong, independent girl with a big, beautiful brain, an attractive body, and wonderful personal attributes, and I can be content for the rest of my life.
As for waiting, I wonder if enough Dominants appreciate the simple design principle of “less is more”.  When Dominating a beautiful, intelligent girl, I often place her in situations where she can do nothing.  Nothing.  No touching. No service to me.  No speaking.  Nothing.
And then I sit back and enjoy what unfolds next.  Had I taken the time to remove one or more of her senses, the experience is amplified.  She will fall into the abyss, and her beautiful mind will take over.
Left in her own subspace, a girl will be transported to an intimate space of my creation, and her reality will morph into any thoughts or suggestions I might have placed.  She may be wetting, thinking of all the things I might do her next, or she may be writhing in her bonds as she hears a door open and close, after I have suggested (via an intense whisper) it might be time for her to demonstrate her sexual talents to others.
Less is indeed more.  She will lose sense of place and time, and she will be comforted only by my voice, my touch, and whatever sensation I wish of her next.
Let your girl wait for it.  And yes, girls, I can see you smiling and nodding.
Nothing more need be said.(via lustypain)

Here is an awesome example of attention to detail. At first blush this position doesn’t look too difficult. The crotch rope is bound to a hook and looks to be providing some relief. While the slaves head movement is limited by a rope to the neck, the hair tie would give some support.
What I see in this photo is the master who made sure to rotate and bind her wrists facing down, rather than the natural position they would take when standing like this. That simple change adds enough stress that the slave would never be able to fully relax during their time here. Try it yourself, first with wrists facing upward in their natural position and then rotate them to face the floor.

This slave is so far into space that it has forgotten how to keep its mouth closed. I think there is a pretty good chance that it will still be covered in wax and come when Master wakes it up tomorrow.
The use of red wax makes a dramatic statement, especially in the locations that it has been used. Can anyone identify the source of this scene?(via beatemall)

I appreciate the effort to get the guest room in order but you’ve got to bind these cunts wrists higher so they are made to wait with their heels off the ground. The one on the right is practically resting when it should be serving.(Source: whiteslaver)

I love a slave tied into a reverse prayer, but never seen this type of tie before. The stress this animal is under must be phenomenal as not only are its arms bound in an aggressive manner it is also being partiality elevated from the same ropes. I’d love to see this performed on a waist high table that put the throat in a more convenient position. Get that ass hook tied to her hair as well and you could give it a light ass fucking while using its throat.(via knotkinky)

Series: Samantha#2
The past three days had been a blur. After packing everything she owned into a small bag, Sam had said goodbye to her friends and arrived at the airport where that familiar chill had washed over her.
The flight had sucked, bad weather, bad people. Curling up in her seat she had tried to make herself as small as possible and shut out the world. Maybe it was for the best, despite the fear of arriving she was desperate for the flight to end.
Arrival. More lines, more shitty people. Now that Sam was here, that familiar chill had turned to outright terror. Shaking as she collected her bag, Sam made her way outside. Slipping on a pair of earbuds she tried to calm herself as she stepped into the taxi line.
Reaching the front, Sam managed a small smile as she handed the attendant a note. Reading it over for a moment he whistled sharply, gesturing at a car. Folding the paper, he held it out for her as his eyes began to crawl over her body. Sam quickly grabbed the paper from his hand and looked at the ground. He had seemed ready to bend her over the fence and fuck here in front of everyone.
After what felt like an eternity the car pulled up and the driver took her bag. Sam slipped into the back, trying to get comfortable on the hard plastic “leather”. As the driver slumped into his seat with a thud she again held out the note that would decide her fate.
The sky was darkening quickly as the car raced down the freeway. Sam pulled her hood down, trying her best to hide in the shadows with her music. It seemed like every time she glanced up to look out the window she saw the driver’s eyes silently watching her in the mirror.
Then it was over. Sam stood next to her bag in the cool air, her breath visible with every shallow breath. Staring up at the house, it fell quickly back into shadows as the taxi pulled away.
Sam pulled the warm hood from her head, letting the earbuds fall away as her eyes adjusted to the light. Closing her eyes for a moment she steeled herself and began to walk up the path. As she climbed the stairs to the porch each step creaked, as if urging her to turn back.
Now or never. Sam raised her hand to the knocker on the door and let it fall with a heavy thud. A shadow moved past the window and she jumped a bit at the loud clack made as the door was unlocked. Sam strained to see in the dim light as the door opened but quickly found his eyes. Suddenly feeling like she was on fire she glaned back at the ground.
His hand reached out, requiring Sam to make the next move. Reaching for it she felt that chill again as he suddenly closed his hand firmly on her wrist. Panicking for a moment she gasped. Her sound hung in the silence as he held her wrist in place, waiting for her to commit.
Sam stepped forward into the dim room, his hand guiding her. Leaving her bag on the porch he closed the heavy door with a thud. Jumping again as the lock made its familiar clack Sam opened her mouth. “Hello Sir.”
