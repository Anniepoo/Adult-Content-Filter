Action: Two beautiful people are snuggled on the sofa, sharing in each other’s time, space, dreams, and love.  They vibe off each other, they complement each other, they desire each other.  What makes this scene different is that the man and woman are graced with the kisses of warm, rich hues of ebony upon their skin.  It was their ancestors who survived dehumanizing slavery so that their descendents could live and thrive and love.  And love they do, but it’s not a rushed, clichéd formulaic love, it’s tender, purposed, sensual, and it’s soulful.  It’s Sensu-Soul.

Anticipation
There is a law, a universal law, that is the comprised of the forces of time and chemistry and desire.  When all of those elemental forces are combined, they create a world-wind of desire and mind-numbing anticipation.  It’s “The Wait” … it’s my overwhelming need to experience you completely, in your entirety.  It has consumed me.  My thoughts and fantasies are filled with the need to be with you, to feel you inside me, to become one with you.  I know the day will come when I will be able to know you intimately but the anticipation is driving me insane.  We have played this game long enough.  Now is the time.  Now is OUR time.  Late at night, when I hear your deep and sensual voice on the phone, and your gentle moans let me know that you are aroused; it’s all I can do to contain myself.  I want you; I need you.
I long to feel your mouth on every part of me.  Descend upon me like the warm waters of the Nile River bathing the shores of ancient Egypt.  Please, sweet Pharaoh, I’m begging you to take your time.  My desire is to be covered with your sweet kisses as I feel your body press into mine.  I need to feel your lips exploring every curve, every crevice of my caramel-colored frame with exacting and excruciating detail.  That place on my collar bone that protrudes ever so slightly longs to know the feel of your tongue as if they were made to be together.  Feast on my arms, my fingers, my back and neck with the patience of a skilled surgeon and the desperation of a man consumed with lust.  I want you to tell me how it feels as you learn what makes me giggle and squirm with pleasure and delight, kissing your way gently down my body.  I want you to smell my sweet, intimate fragrance like the rare and exotic flower it is.  I want you to take your time caressing the softness of my inner thighs with your mouth, being near my glorious center but knowing it is truly your dessert and savoring every morsel of your meal before you delight in my delicious confections.
For years I have dreamed of the day when you would become mine.  I don’t wish to possess you like an object but simply be allowed to share in the uniqueness you embody.  I promise that if you play with my nipples until I am burning with passion, I will become insatiable and ravenous to your touch.  I need you to spread my legs as I invite you to explore my erotic folds of femininity and tease my aroused clit gently and softly, ensuring that I whimper and plead for satisfaction and release.  Feel the slippery wetness of my arousal for you, letting you know that I crave you inside me.  Know that my juices will taste like the sweetest honey and wine, intoxicating you with my flavor and flowing freely.
Mostly, at night, when I’m in bed alone, I fantasize about that moment, that breath-taking sensation when you penetrate me and we become one.  I have wanted that and waited for so long, for far too long.  Now is our time.  I want to give you all of me, not just my body but my heart, mind, and soul.  I belong to you.  I need you to make love to me.  Penetrate me, slow and intentionally, deep and hard.  I want to feel every hot, hard, throbbing inch of you inside me.  I will wrap my legs around you and pull you closer as you breathe new life into me with my kisses.  This is our time; we’ve waited long enough.  I want to get lost in the pleasure of being your woman, being connected to you by the gift so few men have been given.  I’m dripping with desire for you and I am wet and desperate and ready for our union, our reunion really, of our spirits connecting and our bodies colliding in unison and ecstasy.

“White Americans must recognize that justice for black people cannot be achieved without radical changes in the structure of our society. The comfortable, entrenched, the privileged cannot continue to tremble at the prospect of change of the status quo. … This is a multiracial nation where all groups are dependent on each other. … There is no separate white path to power and fulfillment, short of social disaster, that does not share power with black aspirations for freedom and human dignity.”Martin Luther King:  'Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community’ 1967

Your Blue Eyes Ain’t Like Mine
I need to talk to white people for a minute.  I’m here to say that you have been fooled into a false sense of superiority.  Black people have been trying to emulate your looks since we were enslaved on the plantation.  We spend countless hours, dollars, and tears trying to alter ourselves, changing the way we are supposed to look in order to look more like you.   You think that we should think, act, and look like you in order to be considered attractive.  It seems you have established yourself as the standard of beauty and everyone else is supposed to bend, meld, and conform to what you look like in order to be considered attractive.  I’m here to tell you that I’m not a slave.  I’m free from the mental chains that tell me that your features, traits, and aesthetics are better than mine.  I’m not obsessed, intrigued, or captivated by the beauty standards of white people.  I don’t covet or crave your flowing, straight hair; I simply don’t think it’s more attractive than my own.  I love my nappy, wooly, African hair.  I don’t have to have bouncy, shiny curls in order to feel beautiful and you can rest assured that  I have less than zero need to sew someone else’s hair in my head to try to emulate what grows out of your head.  I adore the hair that God has graced me with and I don’t think it’s bad, unmanageable, or ugly.   Long hair is more attractive on women, or so you say.  I say I can rock my hair short and feel confident, beautiful, and unapologetically Black.  No, my hair is not the color of the sun, it’s the color of the dark night sky, the color of the vast and infinite universe.  I think my hair is beautiful in its natural state that is nothing like yours.  It defies gravity.  Your hair can’t do that.  I don’t need to dye, lighten, or change my hair color to feel more attractive.  My black hair, my BLACK hair is gorgeous, just the way it is.  I don’t have to alter my appearance to try to look like you because I’m comfortable in the skin I’m in.  Your light eyes are nice, for you, but I much prefer my own deep, dark soulful eyes.   I will never buy colored contacts because I think that your blue or green eyes are more attractive.   I don’t want or need to have children who are beige, I don’t want to see their hazel eyes reflected in mine because I honor and love the Black Africans who came before me, whose blood courses through my veins, not the slave masters who raped my ancestors.  If you know nothing else in life, if there is one thing you can be assured of when you take your last breath on this earth, you can know without question that I will never try to lighten my skin to look more like you.  My melanated, brown skin is perfection in my eyes.  My full lips and wide nose may be ugly to you, you may be repulsed by my thick facial features.  That’s okay with me.  I don’t think your thin lips and pointy noses are attractive.  If I pick up a magazine or turn on the TV, the media would have me believe that I’m obese if I’m over a size 6.  That’s fine … for you.  For me … not so much.  I’m blessed with a big, round ass and thick thighs and I that fits me just fine.  You see, there shouldn’t be just one standard of beauty in this diverse, colorful world.  So while most Black people are trying to look like you, while they feel that they are more attractive the less African they look, I’m not burdened with that unhealthy and debilitating belief.  I can celebrate myself, my features, and my own inherent African beauty and be confident and secure.  I can hold my shoulders back and my head high.  I LOVE the skin I’m in.  Copyright 2015 AfroerotiK

A race of people who brutally kidnapped, branded, beat, raped, tortured, bought, sold, enslaved and murdered another race of people simply for the color of their skin should be considered barbaric and unfit to police anyone.

In my lifetime advances in technology have been astounding.  I’ve been fortunate enough to witness rotary phones become push button phones, then came answering machines which in turn became voicemail, beepers evolved into cell phones.  I’ve seen cell phones go from being only able to make calls, to texting, to having access to the internet, being cameras, calculators, music players, guidance systems, and countless applications that allow you to do almost anything.  Now, there are watches no bigger than a matchbook that are cell phones.  Television in my lifetime has gone from huge consoles with four channels to ½ inch thick high definition devices with 1000s of channels.  The internet itself is nothing short of miraculous considering that access to information was relegated to having access to whatever library that was closest to you.  The military can now fly remotely-operated drones that are size of mosquitoes.  Certainly, 1000s of years from now, this time in history will be marked as one of the greatest leaps in technological advancement in recorded history.  What hasn’t evolved, what has devolved in fact, what has remained stagnant and medieval is the consciousness of humanity.  This time in history will be recorded as when the beliefs of the masses remained medieval and willfully ignorant.  People refuse to evolve, they intentionally hold on to oppressive and unenlightened beliefs.  It’s one thing to believe that the earth is flat if all you have is a simple telescope.  It’s quite another arrogant and ignorant thing to assert that there is no other live forms in the UNIVERSE other than Earth.  The universe is infinite.  Infinite.  To suggest that there is no other life in the universe other than Earth is as stupid as claiming that the moon is made of cheese.  Sexuality and religion are the areas where people remain the most willfully ignorant.  To believe that God, the creator of all, the consciousness that perfectly organizes everything in nature is a male is akin to believing that you can fall off the edge of the earth.  Spiritually, we are an intentionally and woefully myopic.  It’s profoundly shameful that we are still intent to hold on to ridiculous concepts like heaven and hell and a devil and a God who doesn’t want you to experience pleasure unless you are married.  All men have the potential to be aroused when anally stimulated.  Every single solitary one.  There is nothing that makes some men experience pleasure anally and others not.  A man does not automatically become feminine if he experiences pleasure anally, it’s not even an indication that he is homosexual but the vast and overwhelming majority of humanity at this time believes that if a man experiences pleasure anally, he’s gay.  It’s shameful to be so ignorant in this day and age yet we are.  The collective intellect of people today is pitifully and shamefully low.  With vast amounts of information literally at our fingertips, people don’t read, they don’t learn, they don’t question, they don’t study.  Even higher education is woefully substandard.  The race of people who kidnapped, enslaved, raped, murdered, and sold HUMAN BEINGS like cattle is considered the most evolved.  That, to  me, is the most absurd of all of our collective beliefs.  Anyone who could beat, torture, abuse, rape, enslave, and murder another race of people for their own financial benefit should absolutely be considered the most barbaric race of people alive.  Yet Black women sew yak hair to their heads to emulate the hair of our oppressor and we idolize light skin as if it gives Blacks more value because they are close to being white.   Black people hold on to the beliefs of the plantation and are proud of it.  They brag that want to believe what their grandparents taught them, never once considering that education was intentionally withheld from our ancestors for a reason, to keep us dumb.  We are emotionally immature as a race of people, the human race.  Lying has become so commonplace, people don’t even feel bad about it.   We are not enlightened.  We are not evolved.  We are not educated.  We are holding on to superstitions and stupidity that should have died out thousands of years ago.  We are on a collision course of epic proportions if you do not lift our collective consciousness in our lifetimes.

White man:  “I’m turned on by my wife fucking black because it’s so taboo.”  AfroerotiK:  Sex with animals is taboo.  Sex with children is taboo.Sex with dead bodies is taboo.  White women having sex with Latino men is not considered taboo.  White women having sex with Asian men is not considered taboo.  There is nothing taboo about an adult Black man and an adult white woman having sex unless you view Black men as animals.  *Please note that the vast majority of white people don’t even give Black men the respect of referring to them as human beings when discussing interracial sex.  They say BBC or use the term black as if referencing a color in a crayon box.

Your Sexual Secrets
The advent of the personal computer and the internet has created
what I’m convinced is an epidemic of unhealthy behaviors.  EVERYONE, with so few exceptions as to be
barely negligible, looks at, masturbates to, and is aroused by the myriad of
porn and the extreme and various genres that are available literally at our
fingertips. Everyone has a sexual online identity that they would NEVER share
with anyone else, that they don’t want another human being to know that they
compartmentalize, hide, deny, and don’t acknowledge to even themselves.  Look at the user-submitted video sites
online.  Look at how many videos are
submitted DAILY that show people engaged in sexual behaviors that would never
be considered mainstream or even discussion for polite society.  Even those of us who admit that we look at
porn have sites we visit, we have things that arouse us that we would never
share with another human being, not even our significant other.  The amount of extreme, fetish, and bizarre
content that is available is all the proof I need.  It’s impossible to believe that only a
handful of people are creating the volumes of extreme sexual content that
exists online.  And for every individual
who feels comfortable creating a video of themselves doing really extreme
things, there are 10s of thousands, 100s of thousands, perhaps millions of individuals who would NEVER create or
share a video of themselves, who would never comment on forums or message
boards or take a chance that someone would link them with a subject matter that could be considered deviant.  When I was growing up my mother had a collection of porn
that was graphic and extreme and explicit.
To say that it was hardcore would be an understatement, it included
every genre other than those that would be considered illegal.  My mother is as sexually-repressed and
conservative, religious (hyper religious in fact), and as “normal” as the next
person.  If she had that sort of
collection, long before the internet was even a concept, then there is no way
to convince me that in this day and age people’s normal curiosity doesn’t lead them,
even those people who profess to be bastions of morality and chastity, to look at
material that is “bizarre and weird”.
That sort of compartmentalization is unhealthy.   I look
at porn that is bizarre and extreme and I happen to think that my sexual
practices are far more conservative than most people.  I don’t’ compartmentalize my sexuality.  I make very concerted efforts to be honest
with my partners about the types of things that have aroused me late at night,
when I’m horny and lonely and desperate for arousal.    I’ve graduated from looking at the more
tame genres to seeking out things that were once repulsive to me.  I know that when I do find a partner with
whom I’m willing to share my body and my fantasies, that there will come a day
when I MUST share ALL the things that have aroused me over the years.  I have to do that for myself, for our
relationship, for the opportunity to be completely honest with not only him but
with myself.How many of us are ashamed of our sexuality?  We think that what we like, desire, fantasize
about in private is different, extreme, and dirty in comparison to what society tells us
is acceptable, to what other people like.
We don’t want to express our true desires to our lovers because we are
afraid we will be judged, that we will be seen as abnormal, because we’ve been
socialized to believe that what goes on between our legs is bad, dirty, and
shameful. Join with me as we begin a new chapter in
our lives in which we view our sexuality through different eyes,
embrace our sensuality as part of our spirituality, and we begin to rethink the
ways in which we’ve been taught to view pleasure at the various stages of our
life. It’s that sort of thinking that is revolutionary and AfroerotiK.

It’s the 21st century.  We are living in a time when we have more access to information, to knowledge than any other time in recorded history.  It amazes me, it astounds me actually, the willful ignorance that abounds about sex and sexuality in this day and time truly boggles my mind.  We might as well be living in The Dark Ages with leeches to treat deadly plagues because people, the vast and overwhelming majority of people, believe the most stupid, asinine things about sexuality.    Being bisexual does not mean that you have to be equally attracted to both men and women.  Being bisexual does not mean that you automatically want to form a romantic, emotional relationship with someone of the same gender, it simply means that you can have sex with both genders.  Just because you have a preference for one gender over the other that does not mean that you are somehow heterosexual.  It’s very possible to be sexually aroused by both genders without your masculinity or femininity being altered in any way.  If you are blindfolded and you are sexually stimulated you will be aroused regardless of the gender of person.  If a woman is sexually aroused by other women that does not mean she is going to become masculine NOR does it mean that a man is going to become feminine if he is sexually aroused by other men.  Men and women have the EXACT same anatomy that allows them to experience arousal and pleasure when stimulated anally.  That’s not entirely true.  Men have a prostate that women do not have and when the prostate is stimulated, it provides pleasure.  Not just gay men.  Not just feminine men.  Not just some men.  ALL men have the potential to experience pleasure when stimulated anally.  It has nothing to do with a man’s sexual preference or his masculinity.  Bottoms, tops, sissies etc., they are all labels that reinforce the false belief that being a woman is synonymous with being submissive, being humiliated, being degraded and I have news for you, those things are not inherent to women.  There is no genetic markers that make women predisposed to being slapped, spit on, gangbanged or used.  If a man is anally aroused, putting on a dress and wearing stockings and heels does not make him a woman.  Unfortunately, common sense, logic, reason, and facts have no bearing on the absurdity that people believe about sex and sexuality.  Black people especially.  Because we expect men to be one-dimensional, hyper-masculine Neanderthals, we claim that there is no such thing as bisexuality, that a man has to be gay if he is sexually aroused by both genders and that he’s just denying it.  Because we are so desperate to believe the white man’s religion that was beaten into us, we turn our backs on plain truths that can’t be denied.  There is no big bad sky daddy who watches what we do in the bedroom and who is offended by our pleasure.  We believe all sorts of truly stupid things: that the tightness of a man’s jeans or the color of his shirt can determine if he’s bisexual.  This is 2015 and people really believe that.  There is too much information at our fingertips, there is too much damn porn in genres that have to be seen to actually be believed that prove beyond all reasonable doubt that people are aroused by far more than heterosexual, missionary sex on a Friday night with the lights out.  Yet we live in willful ignorance and pretend that humans are supposed to be asexual and chaste.  I’ll tell you what’s a sin.  It’s sinful that we choose to be so close-minded and brainwashed.

In college classrooms all over the country, Black young women are being taught that anything and everything that a woman does is empowering.  They are being taught that sex work, promiscuity, vulgarity, and choosing to be degraded is a Black woman’s agency.  They are being taught that respectability is a dirty word, meant to oppress women and people of color, and make them conform to some sort of 1950s, Caucasian model of behavior.  Feminism in college classrooms all across this nation has come to mean conforming to sexist, oppressive, misogynist standards of attractiveness to men.  I know EXACTLY the moment this new scholarship began.  I witnessed its birth.  More than a decade ago, Bill Cosby spoke out publicly saying that Black people shouldn’t buy $200 pairs of sneakers for their children when they don’t have a computer and that they shouldn’t name their children ghetto names.  He was quite detailed and went on and on about how Black people have “dropped the ball.”  White people ate it up.  White people heard their role model dissing the behaviors they found offensive from Black people and they rallied around him like he was the Moses himself delivering the Black commandments.   The response from the Black masses, way back then before our collective consciousness became anti-intellectual and ghetto, fell in one of three camps.  The first were the “Yeah, Bill, you tell them! Those niggers! I’m not like them,” camp.  They suffer from what I call the AIC or the Assimilated Inferiority Complex.  They think whites are superior and they want to be liked, seen as good as, and respected by whites.  They needed to distance themselves from “those” Black people so they ridiculed the patterns and behaviors that habitually show up in impoverished black communities.  It should be noted, they were the loudest and most populated camp.  The second camp was the, “Don’t air our dirty laundry in front of white people,” camp.  They were willing to admit that the things that Bill Cosby was talking about had some validity but that he couldn’t talk about it in front of white people, he could only discuss it in private in front of other Black people so a whole lot of hand-ringing, finger-pointing, and accomplishing-nothing could be done.    Apparently, it’s not okay to talk about our dysfunction in front of whites but it seems to be a greater sin to actually work to heal the collective ills that plague our society.  The third camp roasted marshmallows and sang campfire songs about how the ghetto was some sort of Black cultural manifestation of creativity and survival that was a bastion of all things good and righteous.  It is this third camp that created this backlash against respectability.    Respectability was associated with whiteness and therefore ipso facto respectability became bad.  This group, this small faction decided that any behavior Black people collectively exhibit was deemed inherent to our blackness and thus it was all good.  Buying your three year old $200 sneakers was fine because if white people could do it, so can we.  All three camps are misguided and wrong.  The “I’m not a nigger but those other Blacks are,” the “We might have problems but let’s not talk about them in front of white people,” and the, “Everything Black people do is justified no matter how dysfunctional it is,” philosophies are all flawed.  Perhaps the most detrimental is the third camp who feels that anything and everything that Black people do is somehow a cultural inheritance.    We don’t have to speak well because speaking well means you are trying to be white.  Noooooo, slaughtering the English language is supposed to be some sort of adaptation of Gullah dialect that is passed down blah, blah, blah.  In reality, our inarticulation is because whites have denied us equal education.  There is nothing inherently Black or African about not using verbs other than Blacks have been historically denied education to keep us stupid.  But to the misguided masses, they want to believe that not being able to use the English language makes you more Black.  Only to the deluded does being intelligent, being an academic mean you are denying your Blackness, as if intellect is only the domain of whites.  Education does not make you white.  Speaking correct English does not make you white.  More importantly, not everything that you do is empowering.  Today’s youth has no concept of what the concept of empowerment means.  To them, manipulating people is empowering.  To them, lying, cheating, stealing and using people is empowering.  Dear God, anything that gets you money is supposedly empowering, even if you must sell your soul, your humanity, your dignity and your body to get it.  If men use women, that’s supposedly empowering as long as women co-sign it.    Then, there is poor old me.  I’m the fourth camp.  I belong to the “Yes, there are collective dysfunctional behaviors in the Black community but we have them because we have been historically, systematically, and institutionally disenfranchised for centuries, NOT because we are inherently inferior.”  I am member of the, “I’m not afraid to call out our dysfunctional behaviors because I have solutions and alternatives to the current slave mentality that continues to keep us oppressed.”  And I am the leader of the,  “Education, articulation, and respectability are NOT the domain of white people and striving for excellence is not to be as good as white people, it’s to be the absolute best you can be as a human being of African descent,” camp.    Being respectable is not a bad thing, it’s not inherent to white people.  Empowerment means gaining power, autonomy, and integrity through your actions.
