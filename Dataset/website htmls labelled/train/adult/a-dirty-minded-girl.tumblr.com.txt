...My Dirty Mind...
I write stories - sexual stuff mostly. A dash of BDSM, a pinch of vanilla & some romance too. I guess I'm just another pervy girl writer amongst the sea of them on here. I do hope you enjoy my dirty mind.

We aren‚Äôt supposed to beg for someone to stay. Even when the desire to beg floods your soul, it‚Äôs not fair to beg for someone to love you.

Which do you want: the pain of staying where you are, or the pain of growth?

How do I know if I'm giving him a good blowjob? I mean he says he loves it & he moans while I do. But can I make it better in anyway? I want to please him as much as he pleases me. I just don't know if I'm as great as he saysüò©

First off, read this. (It‚Äôs dirtyberd‚Äôs how-to-give-a-blowjob.)¬†Secondly, I sense that your confidence is low and perhaps you might be inexperienced with this sort of thing. If so, just take a deep breath, relax and try not to overthink things. It‚Äôs just a blowjob! It‚Äôs not suppose to be stressful - it‚Äôs suppose to be fun for both of you. I understand it can be nerve wracking but I assure you it‚Äôs not worth the worry and stress you are putting yourself through. So, believe what he says, do some research (if you like) and take time to perfect your skill and gather experience as you make memories with your man :)Also, in my opinion, there‚Äôs no secret special cock sucking technique that makes the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù blowjob. It starts with confidence, comfort, and open communication between the two of you. Yes, there are tried and true methods that you can pull from, but every guy is different. If you are unsure about what you‚Äôre doing or if he likes it, ASK HIM. If he‚Äôs unsure or inexperienced also, then it‚Äôs the perfect opportunity for both of you to learn and grow with this. Try new things, positions, methods (Dirty talk, hand jobs, play with his balls, kiss his body, stroke/suck him at the same time etc). Most importantly, try not to overthink or over-analyze him. Just go with the moment, pay attention to how his body reacts and learn as you go. As time goes by, you will gain more confidence as you get more comfortable with his cock and what to do. Practice makes perfect! Have fun with it and know that you are awesome :)

Update
Still nothing new to post. Writers block + emotional stuff + holiday blues = üòë
I‚Äôm hoping 2016 will jump start things. I miss writing and being adored by you all.
I‚Äôm glad (most of) you guys haven‚Äôt given up on me.
Thank you to those that bought or read through my 2 books.
Also, feel free to ask me questions to keep this blog less empty and boring. Need random sex advice? Or maybe you need help with relationship stuff?
Anon is on!

Any partner we choose will hurt us at one time or another. No relationship, even the most ideal, has unwaveringly smooth sailing ‚Ä¶ There will always be differences between lovers.
