About Us
Established in 2007
Soob continues as a Business to Business digital fashion agency which operates in textile and accessories.
We represent and distribute a wide range of international fashion, shoe and accessory brands throughout Netherlands, Benelux and worldwide countries.
Our global sales network includes:
- Branded stock sales from country to country
- Private Sale Websites Worldwide
- Multi-brand e-boutiques
- Multi-brand Stores and Outlets
Our business begins with a passion for our brands and a deep understanding of our customers, where we operate as a reliable,
fast and flexible hub between our brands, sales agencies and retailers. We keep up the philosophy of being a sustainable,
diverse and 360° service-oriented distribution company, always with a long-term outlook on the demand and development of our markets.
Soob is also sensitive to avoid all parallel, illegal markets in the fashion trading business and
only presents goods which are authentic and authorized for internet and/or physical store sales.
At current stage we supply more than 400 points of sale through 20+ independent sales agencies.
This needs the highest level of integrity, solid execution and outstanding service, where we continually find ways to improve our performance and business.
