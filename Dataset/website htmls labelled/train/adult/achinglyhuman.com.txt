MY BLOG WILL BE MOVING!
Because Blogger is beginning to crack down on adult blogs, I have removed most of the banner ads from the side margin and will be starting a new blog soon.
Keep checking back here, as I will be posting the new address as soon as I have something set up.
Thanks!
Achilles

Speaking of Famous, Sexy Bears
I was walking home from jury duty yesterday (GRAND jury duty) and I stumbled upon this poster for Grown Ups 2 on a marquee.
DAYUM Kevin James was a cutie in high school. I would have been hopelessly, madly in love with this guy:
I'll bet he's got great feet too, but I haven't been able to scrounge up any on the interwebs.

RIP James Gandolfini
Sad news today. James Gandofini, best known as Tony Soprano passed away of a heart attack at the age of 51. While not possessing traditional Hollywood good looks, James was most definitely a sex symbol, especially to those of us who appreciate bears. He had a beautiful smile.
And, whether you're into his type or not, you can't deny he had some spectacularly sexy feet:
Bye, James. Thanks for everything.

Locked, Stocked & Two Ticklish Feet
I think stocks may be the most effective way to make soles helpless...

The Amazing Tom Selleck
Tom Selleck was one of my first crushes. What a perfect specimen of handsome masculinity. And he's got some stellar feet.
And now a napping Tom. Who wouldn't want to sneak up and worship those toes?

About Me
Achilles
New York, New York, United States
For 5 years I was the main artist and owner of AchillesHeelArt, a website dedicated to drawings of men being tickled silly! We closed in October of 2012, but our entire website of more than 600 tickling illustrations is archived in the VIP member's section of MyFriendsFeet.com. Now I'm dedicating more time to this blog, doing drawings for other tickling websites and occasionally taking private commissions! Have fun! Tickle tickle tiiiickle...
