Read the tag
The tag usually says about things your food consists of. Today people usually read tags but they care mostly about expire date and they never read what it says as for the quality and content of a food-stuff they buy. And that is why often people are not satisfied with food-stuff they have and they sometimes have problems with it. It is not the common case though there are still several cases of people felt bad after they ate something. It is important to know what the food you eat is because the food we eat is what we are. It is the source of energy and everything important for our organism. There are cases when people buy half-finished food-stuff because they don’t have much time for cooking. It is a good option in case you are really in a lack of time, though it is terribly wrong to eat such food constantly. Read tags and see if there are no components that are harmful for your body and your health because it is easier to prevent diseases than to get read of it. You can hear a lot about food-stuff when you see its ad but it is the tag only that can give you the real and full information about stuff you are going to eat.

Tea and coffee
Tea and coffee are also about food because people like having a cup of something after they had their breakfast or dinner or supper. See, people always drink something and there are tea-lovers and there are also coffee-lovers. Though, people should never drink too much of tea or coffee because both these drinks may cause harm to people. Well, nothing will turn into poison n case people never misuse it, though if misusing a tea or coffee you will soon feel the influence of those on your body and health. First of all tea and coffee can change the color of your teeth and the color of your skin and believe me, those are not changes for the better. And coffee is greatly provided with caffeine (in comparison to tea) and so too much of coffee may turn a person into nervous something and there may also be a headache. See, these are another reasons for you not to misuse tea and coffee stuff. And as for the tea, it sometimes lows the blood pressure, especial in case it is about green tea and so there is no way for people with low blood pressure to drink it.

The effects of high cholesterol are commonly known.
When referring to “bad” cholesterol, it means that low-density lipoprotein (LDL), simplified as a molecule which is a combination of fats and proteins, transport fat in the blood from the liver to body tissue such as the walls of the arteries. This prevents blood to flow freely through the veins. This fatty material packs, thickens, hardens and eventually over time block the arteries. This condition is known as Atherosclerosis.
However, not all cholesterol is bad. Very little people know that cholesterol, known to be a non-soluble wax matter is significant for building membranes, cell walls, nerve casings and the production of hormones.Subjecting your body to high cholesterol levels can result in conditions such as high blood pressure and other disorders such as Atherosclerosis and fibrosis. You can reduce high levels of cholesterol by maintain a healthy lifestyle that involves a diet with low cholesterol food and a regular fitness program.
An unhealthy lifestyle of immoderation increases the risk of high cholesterol levels. It is important to remember that trans-fats and hydrogenated fats or oils used in food, can be more damaging than the saturated fats of oils of some origin.
Palm oil or olive oil may be more expensive, but is the best choice if you want to be safe against the damaging effects of too much cholesterol. Consider a regular cholesterol test to prevent fatal hypertension or a stroke due to instant increases which you are unaware of.

Food
Any person has to eat every day to gain energy necessary for life and different activities. What is food for us? Some people turn it into some kind of their religion. They collect recipes, exchange ways of cakes baking and speak only about food.
Others are quite indifferent to it and just swallow everything given as they do not want to spend time on such trifles.
The third try to keep to some system like separate nutrition, invalid nutrition and speak about different diets, count calories and try to replace really tasty dishes by something uneatable. Their favourite item in the household is a person-weighing machine.
The most suffering people in this case are usually not those who fuss about diets and calories, but their relatives.
A husband often dreams about a big tasty piece of meat instead of some green salad for dinner after a hard working day. And what is food for you?
