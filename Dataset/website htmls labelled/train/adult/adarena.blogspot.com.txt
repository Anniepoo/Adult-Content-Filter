Maybe not much of an idea here, but definitely an interesting way of promoting the softdrink Kofola on the streets of Budapest, Hungary.

Behind the scenes of the Sony Play-doh shoot
0 comments
Published
by Michal Pastier.
Set to follow in the footsteps of the highly acclaimed "balls" and "paint", the latest advert entitled Sony “play-doh”, has been directed by award winning ‘Gorgeous’ director, Frank Budgen. Now that filming has wrapped up and the ad is in the post-production stages, Sony have been given access to the first behind-the-scenes teaser video which can be found at http://www.bravia-advert.com/. The short teaser allows us to take a glimpse of the New York set and a peak into how the play-doh bunnies were made, without giving too much away!Thanks Zai
Levi's Copper Jeans Campaign

Published
by Michal Pastier.
The idea is that much the same way Copper Jeans' seams and pockets are held inplace with metal rivets, broken bones can be reconstructed with metalpins and plates. Agency Bartle Bogle Hegarty Asia-Pacific thought the vintage x-ray treatment was cool, since it lets them show the jeans in a interesting way, without showingthe talent. Thanks Douglas.
