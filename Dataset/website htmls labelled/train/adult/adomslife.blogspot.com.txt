Tears
I like tears. Not tears of sadness, and not tears of joy. Not My own tears for sure, and not the tears of strangers either. I like the tears the come from putting My girl under duress. Physical, emotional and psychological duress...I pulled out My instruments of torture and set them on the bed. One by one, I picked up the items and showed them to her. I teased her and scared her, trying to decide what I would use on her that night. Would it be the misery stick she hates so much? Maybe the clover clamps that cause way to much pain? Would it be the butt plug up her tight virgin ass? That makes her cry and beg for mercy quicker than anyting I have found so far. Maybe I would just spank her barehanded or viciously slap her face and call her names?But what about the belt that hangs on the headboard of the bed? Its been so long... I suddenly wanted nothing else but to put that belt across her ass over and over. I needed to swat her with it. I got hard thinking about beating her with it. bringing it down over and over on her ass, thighs and back. Yes, I had decided... it would be the belt. I would indulge Myself completely at her expense.I set the other toys aside and told her she would be getting belted. I set her hitachi near and instructed her to roll over. I yanked her shorts and panties off, exposing her bare ass. she turned away and buried her head in a pillow. Its what she does, its how she braces herself for her impending doom. I folded the belt and got it ready for swatting and then leaned over her and told her " beg Me to spank you with the belt". she hesitated so I again told her "beg Me to spank you". she whispered something I couldnt hear, so I grabbed her hard by the hair and yanked her head up putting her face near mine."Beg Me to fucking spank you with this belt NOW slut", I demanded."Please spank me with the belt Daddy", she finally answered, her voice already starting to quiver.I pushed her head back down into the pillow and let her hair fall down and cover her face. " Well, I was gonna spare you the belt tonite but since you insist on it... I guess I will". So I started belting her. Not as hard as usual, but hard enough. I didnt let up, I didnt pause, just over and over I brought it down. I heard her gasping. I told her to get her hitachi and put in on her pussy. she told Me that she couldnt it wouldnt reach (the hitachi plugs in at the foot of the bed). So I instructed her to roll on her side and it would reach. she, with an exasparated tone told Me " That wont work"Bad move, I pulled the vibe away from her and told her "never fucking mind, its not like I care... it doesnt make the spanking any better" So I resumed spanking her but this time the belt was being fueled with anger. she started crying almost imediately after I resumed the beating.I kept at it hard for a few more minutes until she was crying loudly and uncontrollably. I then threw down the belt and told her to roll over. I got on top of her, in between her legs, and fucked her as tears streamed down her cheeks and her mascara ran. I stroked her wet pussy deep and hard until I was ready to let go, then I pulled out and shot my cum all over her.

A Short Story
I have a short story to tell. I was driving to work early yesterday morning when I got a text from My girl. It said "you are going to kill me, I cant find my earrings."
her
earrings are her collar. she must wear one or both of them all the time when she goes out in public. So now I am heading to work thinking up punishment, wondering how many misery stick swats she could take without passing out, when she calls Me. she said "I found them, you know where they were at?",
"no", "they were in My ears and I have been looking for 40 minutes, I am going to be late for work"I laughed because it was kinda
funny, but its also D/s romantic, and this is why... she is so used to wearing My earrings she forgot she had them on. But even more importantly, she panicked and looked for 40minutes. she would rather look for 40min and be late for work than risk My disappointment. she was dreading my displeasure and fearing her punishment. What was 40 minutes of frustration for her, was a display of complete devotion to Me.

Birthday and Collar
I just wanted to catch up on the goings on the past few days. First, we celebrated My girls birthday. I think it was a good one for her.
she spent it with people she loves and she got some good gifts.Second,
one of her gifts was a collar. We didnt and dont consider a collar worn as "necessary" for her to belong to Me, but I wanted her to wear one as a constant reminder to both of us that she does indeed belong to Me. The problem has been subtlety. A month or so ago I came up with the idea of an earring as a discreet collar. she agreed that an earring would work. So I got her a nice set of earrings as a collar. she must always wear at least one. I am debating an extra earhole just for her collar ring higher up on her ear. It would be easier to conceal under her hair, and maybe more comfortable. Additionally, I think it would be a more significant gesture if it was its own piercing. Regardless of ear location, the fact that she now wears My collar is extremely pleasing to Me and I am sure to her. It makes Me happy when I see it.Third, I am feeling better. Still healing but not as miserable as I have been. Feeling good enough to Dom scheme. I have something planned for tonite. Its really devious. I am quite proud of it. I cant tell or it would ruin it but I am sure you will hear about it after the fact.

Tell Me How Dominant You Are
I was talking to My girl last nite, sitting across from her in a chair, I dont know what we were talking about, I just dont quite remember. This is what I do remember her saying and this is what made Me react. she said, "I am a pretty dominant person". I flipped out a little bit ok maybe alot. The Dom hammer got dropped. It wasnt as knee jerk as it sounds, there was a fuse lit earlier. Let Me explain.Earlier that day I was talking on the phone with My girl and this is what I heard for the first time that day, "I am a dominant person." It just rubs Me wrong to hear My /s talk about being dominant. so sue Me. I stewed on it for a little bit that day. It rubbed Me wrong not because I want My girl to be sub to everyone or anyone else but Me for that matter and not because I want her to be a dishrag or somehow weak. I love that she is smart, and capable. It rubbed Me wrong because I want her to be proud of being My /s. I want her to identify as My /s, not the worlds dom. My girls submission to Me is something I need her to embrace completely. she should not only take satisfaction in being sub to Me but she should take pride in it. I dont want her to think of herself as a dominant person to everyone but Me. I want her to think of herself as a submissive person only to Me. she is identifying wrong. her submission to Me isnt the exception... its the rule.So the first time she said it that day it did make Me think. When combined with other clues like her reluctance to call Me Daddy or Sir outside the bedroom it is starting to feel more like she is embarrassed on some level by her submission to Me. I am feeling resistance where there should be none. So when I heard the phrase "I am dominant" for the second time that day without having heard even one Daddy or Sir all day, well I couldnt let it slide. To Me, it was no coincendence that I heard that phrase twice in one day. I took it as her "pushing back", so I had to make a point...I stopped the conversation and told her to get on the floor on her hands and knees. she looked at Me a little panicked and asked why? I just repeated it to her. she looked at Me and she knew I was displeased and it scared her so she hesitated again. I told her a third time to get on her hands and knees on the floor and she said ok and finally did as I instructed. When she was on her hands and knees in front of Me I told her "tell Me again how dominant you are".To Me she is the beautiful girl on her hands and knees in front of Me looking up willing to do anything to please Me. To Me she is submissive, she is My girl and I want her to take pride in it. There is no more important or difficult undertaking in her life than her submission to Me and I want her to be proud of her submission and proud of who she is.she is not the worlds dom... she is My sub that is allowed to dom the world.

More Daddys and Sirs
I want to hear it more. I want to be called Daddy, I want to be called Sir. I like hearing it. I find it pleasing. I dont expect to hear them in most company but there is no excuse why she cant use my titles
when we are alone, or on the phone or in text. I dont mind the occasional other endearment but it starting to feel like she is not quite comfortable calling Me Daddy or calling Me Sir. she needs to get accustomed to addressing Me how I wish to be addressed.
I dont think she is intentionally disobeying,
I just think she is a little uncomfortable with it. That will go away through repetition. I just hope for her sake its the repetition of use and not the repetition of
My belt landing on her ass, legs and back.

Fucking Back
Ok I am HORNY. Seriously, I am super horny. Its been about 3 weeks for Me because of My recent medical mishap. I dont think I have ever gone this long without release. It is absolutely true that the wind blowing just right will get Me hard... ok just the thought of wind blowing does it. Ok just the word "blow" is enough to give me a thrill. So anyhow, I have been having some pretty vivid sex dreams that are now spilling over into daytime fantasy.This was the dream I woke up from yesterday morning. I was on top of My girl. I had her legs up on My shoulders and I was fucking her as deep and as hard as I could. she started fucking Me back. My girl will do this and it really turns Me on not just because it feels good but because the effort is overtly sexual. I see her as being very slutty for Me when she does this. By fucking back, I mean she will do things to buck her hips. fucking back doggie would be her keeping her ass up and pushing back a little as I push in. she has a few ways of fucking back when I am on top. If her legs are down she will put a foot down and lift and lower her ass off the bed/ground. Well in My dream I had her legs on My shoulders. Fucking back from this position entails her straighting her legs as much as she can and then relaxing them. this lifts her hips and lowers them back down. I really do enjoy the effort. Oops a little bit of a tangent, so back to dream... I was on top of her with her legs up on My shoulders and she started fucking back even though I was fucking her as hard as I could. I started berrating her and calling her a nasty slut for fucking back when she was taking it so hard. I began to fuck her even harder trying to get her to freeze in pain, trying to get her to stop fucking back. Whether she slowed down stopped or continued, I would slap her across the face hard call her more names and tell her what whore she was for working so hard to please Me. I kept pounding and pounding her like that all nite in My dream.The thing about this dream is that its a situation that has actually happened more than once. I do like to go on a tirade and humiliate her when I am hurting her and fucking her hard and she is working so hard to increase My enjoyment. The fact that this scene has come back to haunt Me in a dream at My horniest means I REALLY like this moment.I guess if I pull it apart some I can kinda figure out what turns Me on so much about it. In the midst of using her hard for My enjoyment not regarding her pleasure or even comfort in the meantime she tries to give Me even more pleasure by fucking back. I further objectify and use her by humiliating her for the effort. Very sadistic of Me I know. I then start slapping her face which I know she finds deeply humiliating and tell her to keep trying to fuck Me back. I make her feel like a total slut for Me for trying... more humiliation. Then I fuck her harder and harder to try and get her to stop and if she does I chastise her for stopping. Wow I am even hornier now!

Where We Have Been.
So its My fault that My girl and I have been M.I.A. from the blogs this month. I have had a semi surprising and completely miserable medical issue come up. I am not going into details but to say not life threatening just really uncomfortable to the point of torturous at time over the past few weeks. I am on the mend from the trauma and gearing up to cope with some long term issues. There have been a few positives to come out of the mess of this month. The biggest positive has been how much closer together I feel it has brought Me and My girl.I dont know exactly what I want to say... I am still sorting thru some thoughts but I feel closer to her now than I ever have before. she has been My angel.
I was exposed and vulnerable and in need. she without question was there for Me in everyway.
When My strength faultered she kneeled so that I could lean on her. When I needed to find a reason, she was there with a smile and her big blue doll eyes to remind Me how good life can be. When I thought it couldnt get any worse she made Me think it wasnt so bad.I feel as though I have shown her alot of My "weak spots" as a person lately and then the medical thing from hell happened and she saw Me maybe at My most vulnerable. I know now she accepts Me completely as her Daddy, and as her love. her feelings toward Me, and her submission to Me have not wavered
but rather have only become deeper and stronger.
