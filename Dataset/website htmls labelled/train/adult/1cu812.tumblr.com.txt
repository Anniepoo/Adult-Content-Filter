How to Properly Edge Him
…
The real art with edging is to learn exactly how to get him as
close as possible to an explosion without actually allowing him to
erupt. If you pay close attention while you fondle and play, you’ll
learn precisely the clear warning signs of an imminent ejaculation.
There’s nothing quite like edging for subliminally building a guys
libido and desire. Not only will he cherish you more, thanks to
neurochemistry, but within a short timeframe his vulnerable and
exploitable mind will be totally under your feminine control…
Here are some tips:
1 - Make him always tell you exactly how close he is. Kind of
obvious, but Insist that he tells you when to slow down and when to
stop. Especially in the beginning while you’re learning how to read his
body language. Keep talking to him, ask him how it feels, what is best.
You’ll soon get the feel of it and he’ll love you even more for it…
2 - Feel for his body and muscles tensing, him holding his breath,
arching his back or even tensing, all are signs he’s getting very
close. Learn to read and understand the signs and don’t worry if you go
over, you’re learning. Just be sure it’s a libido-building ruined
orgasm…
3 - Move from strong to soft strokes, from his vein filled shaft
up to his tip constantly. Change it up, take your time and make sure you
get him ultra rock hard for maximum dopamine production in his
vulnerable brain… I personally like lots of lube and oil and fast but
not too tight of strokes, and then as he gets closer and closer, move to
a looser grip and then focus on his hypersensitive head and frenulem
(the strip underneath the head at the top where guys are most
sensitive). Also take breaks frequently. It’s better to stop one second
too early than one second too late, stroke - edge - deny - repeat…
4 - Make it ultimately his fault if he erupts. So again, if he
does explode make sure you properly ruin it. Stop all rubbing and
stimulation as soon as he starts to climax. Or if he’s tied down, you
turn it into a post orgasm torture, after the ruined orgasm, where you
use his slippery cum as lube to keep rubbing his hypersensitive
Joystick, scolding him by saying: you’re so naughty, I didn’t give you
permission to cum…
5 - When you do want to enjoy his pent up explosions, make that
part of the tease too. When you’re planning to make him climax and
erupt, this is a great time to also practice your edging techniques. Use
it as an opportunity to see just how crazy you can make him, where
you’re not worrying about accidently taking him over the edge…
6 - Oh and you can add a wonderfully sadistic element with this
line: If you can hold on for just five minutes more my love, I won’t
ruin it when you do cum, okay baby…

Extra notes by HerBodyOnMyMind:
1 - Routine is critical.  Edge him every day.  For best
results: One short session (15 minutes) every other morning; one
medium-length session (20-30 minutes) every evening before bed; and at
least one long session (40+ minutes) every weekend.  If this seems like a
lot of time, consider how much time you spend alone doing things you
wish he was interested in (like watching your favorite shows on
Netflix).  This is one activity he will eagerly join.  Edging is
addictive to male neurochemistry, and it very specifically addicts him
to you, as long as you do it regularly.  The more you do it, the
more deeply he bonds to you, and the more he will crave spending time
with you throughout the day.  This feeds on itself, and before long,
your nightly “quality time” together becomes perfectly natural for both
of you.  Even if you’re already in love, married, and devoted to each
other, your connection can still go deeper - and the fire of wilder days
can be rekindled.  No more going to bed alone!  Also, any time spent
having sex or pleasuring you can count toward his edge time. (at your
discretion) Daily orgasms for you, his heat beside you as you drift to
sleep, and an eager, attentive lover totally addicted to your touch -
what’s not to love?  No matter how busy or tired you are, you both have
the time for this, I promise.  Do it for a week, and you will start
making time for it.
2 - Edge him more than once.  For most, this is obvious.
But for some new to edging, it needs to be said.  Don’t just edge him
once and assume you’re done.  Depending on his stamina (and how long
it’s been since his last orgasm) it can take a while to build him up to
his first edge of the night.  It’s important to think of it that way:
“first edge of the night.”  Because once you’ve guided him to his edge -
and stopped - he is still highly aroused, and edging him again becomes
easy.  All that build-up was time invested to get him to his most
blissful state.  Now “cash in” your investment and keep him there, by
edging him over and over again.  It should be easy.  A single, slow,
tight pump is sometimes enough.  Watch his reaction and enjoy the show!
(Women report that this is usually their favorite part - guiding their
loved one from edge to edge with subtle touches, watching him, and
knowing the exquisite gift he trusts only her to give.)
3 - Keep him guessing.  Every single time you touch his
cock, he should never know if you intend to edge him, ruin him, or give
him a full orgasm.  Lie to him.  Tell him you’re going to stop, then
don’t.  Or tell him you’re going to ruin him, then give him a full
orgasm.  Or congratulate him on the orgasm you’re about to give him,
then “change your mind” and stop for the night.  This only works if you
also sometimes tell the truth.  Once he learns you are unpredictable,
his body will naturally prepare for orgasm, (every time!) giving him the
rush he craves - while his mind reels in fear of the alternatives.  You
are fucking his mind, in addition to his body - in a very good way!
Watch how he reacts - from the curl of his toes to the flare in his
eyes.  It’s incredibly hot.
4 - A “ruined” orgasm is when you let go and cease all
stimulation, a split second before he climaxes.  His cum will sort of
just leak out, and it’s not as satisfying as a full orgasm.  “Ruined” is
a misnomer, though, because he still gets some small pleasure from it,
so don’t be afraid to ruin him regularly.  He might thrash, beg, or try
to finish it himself, so this is a good time to playfully experiment
with restraints - something as simple as tying his wrists together
behind his back with a belt or necktie will do the trick.  The important
difference between a ruined and regular orgasm is that the male libido
does not diminish after a ruined orgasm.  He will stay horny, eager,
erect, and attentive, as though he had no orgasm at all, and you can
continue playing, if you wish, after a short break.  You can even ruin
him twice in one night - the second one is usually harder to achieve,
though.

Your Goddess promised to tease and edge you repeatedly with a fleshlight. What she didn’t share with you was that she lubed it with numbing cream and you can barely feel anything.
