A Sex Diary

Quick and lazy update (because I’m tired). Spent last night with A and had a wonderful time. From the moment he got here, we had our hands all over each other, kissing and making out. Even dry humped on the couch, which turned out to be pretty hot for both of us. I imagine that was what being a teenager was, you know, if I had someone to do that with when I was a teenager.
We played a lot, more than normal - he had his face in my pussy while I sat on the kitchen counter and spread my legs. He fucked me like that, too. Gave him a sloppy, wet blowjob while he recorded it on his phone. He absolutely loves sloppy and wet blowjobs, and I made sure his cock was slathered in my spit. I can’t wait to watch that video later.
I wanted to ride him, and he let me fuck him to my heart’s content. My favorite part was the way his face looked in the dim light as he bit his hand and tried not to cum as I rode him.
Some point while he was fucking me though, he was so into it and going so hard and fast that he slipped all the way out and briefly entered my ass. I screamed and cried from the pain and he felt so incredibly awful, apologizing profusely and for the rest of the night. After I recovered from it, I told him it was okay and he said, “No, it’s not. I really hurt you.” The tenderness and regret that I heard in his voice really touched me - that and how miserable he looked. “I was pulling out completely so I could feel all of you. How selfish and stupid of me.”
It didn’t stop us from having an incredible night though, once I felt better.

Tinder #1
Yesterday, I matched with this guy on Tinder that seemed ‘just ok’ in attractiveness. I used to only swipe right if I thought that they were REALLY attractive, but I found out that I would never match anyone if I didn’t lower my standards a little. So I am trying my best to match with more people. This guy was really into me, wanted to meet and hang out, so I thought, eh why not get a dinner and some sex out of him? I hadn’t seen A this week, and was really wanting sex, so I figured that this was my chance.He’s the first guy I’ve met off Tinder, by the way, despite my being on the app for a few months now. We met at Red Lobster (per my request), and he was more attractive in person. I liked his voice, and the way that he dressed and carried himself. Turns out, he’s in the sales business, just like A is. They do basically the same thing (travelling and pitching X products to Y people for big company Z), but in different industries. I thought it was amusing, and of course I would like those types - being a salesman, you have to have confidence and charisma. He was half Asian (Taiwanese) and half white, though he definitely didn’t look Asian. He had a beautiful, full beard and stood tall at 6′4″. After dinner we went back to his hotel room, where he turned off the lights (this hit me as strange, because I can’t remember the last time I had the lights turned off specifically to have sex) and we crawled into bed where we eventually began making out and removing clothes.“Oh my god, you have big tits, too,” he commented right before grabbing a handful of them and putting it in his mouth. (I have always thought of my boobs as small, but A has told me that they were large for me, proportionally, so I guess he must be right.)He went down on me - nothing to write home about here.I finally had a chance to feel his cock - definitely nothing to write home about either. Although it was easy to have all of him in my mouth and in my throat, which is a nice change of pace from A’s cock.Actual sex - better than I expected, given the fact that he was much smaller than what I’m used to normally. However, still nothing to write home about.Afterwards, he showered and crawled back into bed to spoon/cuddle me for a little bit, before getting up and dressed. I took this as my cue to do the same, and I left promptly afterwards. About 30-40 minutes after I got home, he texts me saying that he wanted me to go back over and spend the night. When I said that I was too comfortable to leave the apartment but invited him to come over, he said that he couldn’t because he had work in the morning. Then tried harder to get me to drive back to his hotel, and when that didn’t work, said that it was “the least I could do” since he had paid for my dinner. Uh, wow, DEFINITELY not going back now. I ended up just ignoring him. And it made me miss A so very much. We have that chemistry between us that I don’t have with anybody else at the moment. And because of that, our sex feels incredible and everything else is less than mediocre. Not to mention that A never, ever, made me feel like I was obligated to do anything for him just because he spent money on me. Right now, more than anything, I just want someone to really pound me. And I want that someone to be A.

Quick Update
A and I are still seeing each other; the sex with him is still awesome; I’m still generally content and happy in life. Just haven’t had an inspiration to write anything lately. Also, if someone could message me so I can have that instant messaging thing too, that’d be grand. Thanks! :)

valglenly asked: Hey there... if you're just taking a break from the diary, i totally understand.
Just hoping you're ok.
Hope to hear from you soon.Hi! Sorry for the prolonged absence. I took a hiatus from the diary because I wasn’t feeling ‘it’ anymore - ‘it’ being the keeping up with the chronicling and writing stories and all that. It got a little repetitive, a little boring, a little more like a chore rather than a hobby. I have a writer’s block, if you will. However, I’ll always come back, even just to check and answer messages! <3

surfandwrite asked: As someone who has been following you forever I am extremely pissed at those anons. To anon 1 - who the fuck are you to dictate what measures a girl's self worth/confidence? Your opinion is not as important as you fucking think. To anon 2 - if you are being insulted without provoking the other person you are under NO OBLIGATION to act polite. it's not a fucking "intelligence and grace" contest. you dish it, you take it. Jesus christ you're both probably men the way you talk to her about it.Originally posted by atlamilliaheartsAhaha! Thanks @surfandwrite :)

There’s now a Number 14 and Number 15, I’ll get to writing a profile for them later. Both were people I’ve known for about 5 years now, the latter was actually a huge surprise because I’ve always loved him as a brother. And he’s with someone,
but I didn’t know they were still together at the time. He stopped in the middle of it when he realized what he was doing and was overcome with guilt.
A exhibited a lot of jealousy towards my being with other guys and he just admitted it today. But when I asked him if we wanted to become exclusive he said it was fine and that he needed to stop being jealous. If I’m honest, I really wanted him to agree to bring exclusive. I had a terrible dream last week that he started telling me about all these other girls he was fucking and I was really upset by it, both in the dream and when I woke up.

Things I definitely shouldn’t do: develop a schoolgirl crush on A
Things I’m doing: starting to develop a schoolgirl crush on A
Ugh, need to nip it in the bud before it gets serious. But it’s incredibly difficult when he has almost all the qualities that I look for in an ideal man. And it doesn’t help that he’s so sweet to me and I don’t want him to stop being sweet but it also means it’s that much easier to fall for him. 😕

Good Morning
“You’re going to give me the best orgasm of my life” and “You feel better than anyone I’ve ever felt in my life” are probably the highest sexual compliments I’ve ever gotten. A and I have never had morning sex until today. We woke up lazily, laid in bed stark naked for a while: me on my stomach, looking at him, and he on his side, looking at me. “You look good enough to mount right now,” he says playfully. He grabbed my left leg and brought it closer to him, spreading my legs wide open. He then traced his hand down my back, cupping my ass, before his fingers settled down between my inner thighs. Teasingly, his fingers traced my lips before sliding in. He finger-fucked my pussy slow and deep, making me moan and squirm. “You like having your pussy played with, don’t you?”He continued to penetrate me, my pussy taking every finger in hungrily. “I think your pussy is ready for some hard cock, don’t you?” he breathes into my ear. I begged him to fuck me, and lifted my ass up in the air for him, exposing my dripping pussy.He slid into me, filling me up with every inch of his thick cock. Slowly sliding in and out of my warm, wet pussy, feeling me wrap around him tightly, he couldn’t hold back his moans. “You…feel better than anyone I’ve ever felt before. In my life.” Soon, he was fucking me fast and hard, his hands gripping my hips as he slammed his cock into me over and over. On my knees, ass in the air, my face in the pillows screaming in pleasure as he fucked my hole. As he violated me, as he fucked a tight pussy 13 years younger. “Cum inside me, baby,” I begged him as he got close. I wanted him to explode inside me, to fill me up with his warm cum, to coat my pussy walls with his semen. My pussy gripped his cock as he came, taking his entire load inside me. I could feel that he drenched me, his cock slick with his own cum with his final strokes in and out of me.

godzilla76 asked: Haven't posted much lately. Hopefully everything is still ok?Heya! Yes, just haven’t had the chance to be on much. One of my best friends lived with me for about two weeks, and then this past week it’s just been crazy. I am finding less and less time and energy to keep this blog up, but I try to come back and make updates every now and then. :)
