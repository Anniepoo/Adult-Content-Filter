True love doesn’t happen right away; it’s an ever-growing process. It develops after you’ve gone through many ups and downs, when you’ve suffered together, cried together, laughed together.
Te amo!!!

It’s been a rough year for Erica and I, but I’m not giving up. I love this girl with every fiber in me and I’m going to make this work. Two and a half years, many more to come. I love you, peanut.
