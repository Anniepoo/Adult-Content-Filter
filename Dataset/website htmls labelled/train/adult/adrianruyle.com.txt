About the artist
adrianruyle
Petaluma, California, USA
Bio: Like my father and mother, all brothers and sisters, and even a nephew, I went to college at Berkeley. Then made a living for years in mathematics, most notably as research mathematician at Harvard.
Now working in art, I sometimes consider myself, though without title, as a research artist.

Yes, I would acknowledge that you are definitely a “research artist”.
The world needs more of your type to keep us guessing what you will create next.
