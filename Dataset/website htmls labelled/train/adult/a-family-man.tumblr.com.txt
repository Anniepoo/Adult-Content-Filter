Chicago Bears Team Strategy
Not every one of the Bears coaches who’re planning the offense for that approaching season really coaches around the offensive side from the ball.
Defensive coordinator, Vic Fangio-an experienced 28 National football league seasons-challenges the offensive team every play in training camp having a 3-4 plan that’s kept in attack mode.
Offensive coordinator Adam Gase said, “Coach Fangio does such a good job of [showing] multiple looks and doing a great job with the safeties. It is extremely difficult to play their defense.”
"They do such a good job of disguising. It’s such a challenge for our guys every day. We can’t walk out here and just think we’re going to rip them apart because it’s going to be a challenge play-in and play-out. Every play is something different from those guys and we’re kind of adjusting as we go and trying to figure out how to beat them on each play.”
Quarterback Jay Cutler said, “They got after us today. They beat us in about every period we had. [Fangio] has done a good job of mixing it up. He’s not afraid to drop eight or to bring eight. He throws a lot of different things at you—three-down, four-down, nickel, dime. He’s got an extensive package, so it makes you think.”

KC Chiefs Tickets
The KC Chiefs already achieve a contract on the long-term extension with linebacker Justin Houston, which keeps the 3-time Professional Bowler.
The dealing for the contract signing was Wednesday 3:00 pm and gladly to say GM John Dorsey and company was able to get it done on time. In an exclusive interview Dorsey stated, “You really have to applaud the leadership of (Chairman and CEO) Clark Hunt because in reality this wouldn’t have happened without his leadership. That’s how we do this thing is Clark will set the vision and from my position, I have to execute that vision.”
Dorsey performed that vision and established the building blocks from the Kansas City Chiefs defense for the following years. Houston has shown to be among the best defensive gamers within the National football league in the last several seasons. By having an elite mixture of size, speed, quickness, functional strength, energy and technique, Houston provide the Chiefs everything they require around the area at outside linebacker.
Due to Houston’s all-around capabilities, Dorsey understood the procedure to sign the 26-year-old celebrity would take some time and persistence. It requires all the intangible boxes to become checked off too. The said agreement would be a win-win situation for the Chiefs and Dorsey.check out Kansas City Chiefs Tickets

Atlanta Falcons: 5 Items to know from Day 5
1. Tough day for Offense. The Falcons’ offense battled throughout practice, as dropped passes, fumbles and miscommunication hampered the system throughout seven-on-seven and 11-on-11 drills. Growing pains may be expected, though, so one frustrating day isn’t likely to trigger sensors.
2. Steps Up of Terron Ward: Even though the offense in general worked out poorly, Terron Ward - an undrafted running out of Oregon State - ongoing to create noise. By exhibiting strong hands and running with energy, the 23-year-old has proven he could be a versatile resource as needed.
3. No Depth Chart For The Time Being: The Falcons don’t have any official depth chart at this time, and before the regular season approaches, that won’t change. This provides the training staff an opportunity to combine gamers on several models to determine where everybody fits best.
4. Nate Stupar Centered on Future: Nate Stupar gained a roster place this past year by supplying value on special teams, however, the former Jaguar doesn’t think that success can help him continuing to move forward.
5. Injuries Update: Cliff Matthews, Coleman, and Brooks Reed extended using the team but didn’t put on pads or take part in regular drills. Justin Durant came back towards the area following a brief absence earlier within the week. Undrafted rookie Beau Gardner hurt his knee throughout practice and it is being examined this mid-day.

San Diego Chargers 2015 Training Camp Preview: Quarterbacks
As we near the beginning of training camp on July 30, we’ll preview each position for the San Diego Chargers.
Starting on the quarterbacks. The Bolts presently have four on their own roster: Philip Rivers, Kellen Clemens, Brad Sorensen and Chase Rettig. Rivers - Probably the most prolific Chargers to ever don the lightning bolt, Rivers is near further greatness in 2015. He needs just three touchdown passes to overtake Dan Fouts.
Rivers make its way into his twelfth season fresh off another ruling campaign by which he completed 379-of-570 attempts (66.5%) for 4,286 yards and 31 touchdowns for any 93.8 passer rating. Rivers also published his sixth-career 4,000 yard season, tying Favre Fined and Serta Marino for that sixth-most 4,000-yard campaigns in National football league history.
Quarterback Coach Nick Sirianni said to Rivers: “He really is unbelievable. He has a football photographic memory. He sees everything on the field and remembers everything. Obviously as coaches we have the benefit of going back and rewinding the film, but Philip doesn’t really need to do it. He does do it, but it’s like he doesn’t even need to because he sees everything and remembers it.
That is what is so incredible; how he remembers everything….His knowledge of the game with blitzes is impressive. What makes great players is knowing the scheme like the back of your hand, and thinking quick on the field. Philip has that, but he also plays with phenomenal technique. He is a technician on the field, so all of that is what makes him great. It’s pretty special.”

Denver Broncos Tickets on Sale
ENGLEWOOD, Colo. – The starters were back, the sun’s rays beat down around the fields, and also the Broncos experienced their longest and most difficult practice of training camp so far.
The bustle from the practice were just as much mental as physical, and when it had been done, Wednesday’s one-day rest from full-contact work appeared especially welcome.
Gary Kubiak, Broncos head coach said, “That was our longest practice so far, and we had a lot of stuff. We went to the red zone today and had a lot of new teaching, and with that came a lot of mistakes, so we’ve got a lot of things as coaches to go back and fix.”
He added, “You just always try to remind them of where you’re at. I think the first thing as the coach you want to see [is] that. You don’t want to see them waiting on you all the time because you’re not out there on the field with them come game days. You want to see your leaders stop things like that and regroup. But that is a part of football, too throughout the overall game, you’ve bad unexpected things happen. Are you able to collect yourself and go the following series? This is the way practice is. I had been just attempting to help remind them every single day.“
Kubiak had given some annoyance with the way the team finished a number of its recent practices but loved the power he saw as the team closed out it’s operating in another red-colored-zone period. The 3 sequences ended with touchdown passes: Peyton Manning-to-C.J. Anderson, Brock Osweiler-to-Isaiah Burse and Zac Dysert to Bennie Fowler.
That’s a good place to stop for a break and Kubiak has a good feeling for the upcoming game.Denver Broncos
