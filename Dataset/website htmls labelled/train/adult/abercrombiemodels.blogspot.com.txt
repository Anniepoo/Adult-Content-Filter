Hot Guys Blogs
If you want to see who are the hot guys on the Internet, the best source is to check out one of the many bloggers who highlight hot guys. Many of these bloggers make it their duty to inform the world about "who" is hot or attractive. They seem to have their finger on the pulse of all the hotness out there.Some bloggers simply post photos they find and do not give their readers the names of the guy in the photo. We think that is lazy. The best bloggers include the name of the guy, source of the photo and add a bit of commentary of why they think the guy is hot.We wonder who is behind all these blogs? Are they bored office workers who want to tell the world about the male pulchritude they find (while the boss is not looking)? ...or are they retired workers - looking for a pastime? Do any blog full time and make their living at writing about hotties?Check out this list of "hot guy blogs". Are there any blogs you read on a daily basis that should be included in the list?
