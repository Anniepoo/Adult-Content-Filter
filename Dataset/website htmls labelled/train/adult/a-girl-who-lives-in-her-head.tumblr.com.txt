study-well:
For my final year I’m performing a study and I’m looking for participants.
To participate in the research, you need to be in a relationship, and your partner must also complete the study. You need to be at least 18!
It will involve answering some general questions about your relationship (heterosexual, homosexual, demisexual, pansexual, bisexual, and asexual participants are welcomed), and providing some information about yourself (e.g., age, and education).
You will also be asked questions about your similarity to people who hold different sets of beliefs.
All participation will be anonymous, and there will no way to trace your data back to you.
If you’re interested in taking part or would like more information, please contact me at morsene@cardiff.ac.uk. I’ll send an information sheet and then if you’re still interested, a link to the study!
Really looking for any couples in which either a single member or both members fall under the asexual spectrum!
I can’t do this because I’m not 18 and not in a relationship but, as I want to study Psychology at uni also, I implore each of my followers to take part. It won’t take long and it’ll seriously help out. Please, if you’re eligible, take part :)

Anonymous asked:
I love your headcanon and the the fan fiction. I was wondering if you write a Our Two Bedroom Story headcanon. How would the the guys react seeing MC waiting in the bedroom while wearing lingerie?
I’m sorry for the wait, I’m only just managing to get around to taking up requests again! So, I’m sorry it took so long for me to answer this but I would absolutely love to do this request! I have changed the situations around a little to make them all different but the premise is still the same! Enjoy!OTBS - What Happens When You Wear Lingerie For Him (NSFW)MinatoThere’s no way on this earth that he’ll find this sexy. You thought with a sigh as you gazed down at yourself, biting your lip nervously. You had on a deep red, lacy set of lingerie with black silk embellishments; a black silky garter with a silky red bow hugged your thigh and black heels adorned your feet. Laid in the centre of the bed you shared with your boyfriend, you couldn’t help but feel nervous. You had never worn something quite as risqué in your entire life and you had no idea how he’d react. “Babe, I’m home!”Minato’s voice called out through the house and you took a steady breath.“How was work?” You called out casually, trying to get the confidence to walk into the hallway to greet him.“Stressful. The Growler moved my deadline for that article from the end of the week to the end of tomorrow.” Minato sighed, his voice getting closer to the bedroom. “And that weird, punny freak was made my partner on the interviews too But I’ve got a surprise for you…” “A surprise? Well…” You smiled as seductively as you could and exited the bedroom. “I’ve got a surprise for you too, Minato.” You leant against the doorframe, your fingertip trailing down the curve of your waist. Looking up you saw not one, but in fact two men, staring at you in awe.Minato had never seen you looking so… seductive. Your panties left little to the imagination they were so small and her breasts moved up and down with every breath, your nipples – already puckered and ready for him – were so clearly visible beneath the lace of her bra that Minato’s mouth began to water. And then he saw the shoes. They made her legs look longer and Minato was confused at how much seeing her naked legs and high heels aroused him.It was just a shame that his brother was stood beside him.For a few long seconds, the three of you stood there, uncertain what to do. Minato was the first to move, leaping over to you and standing in front of you protectively, blushing up to his ears as he tried to hide your sexy, curvy, soft and glorious body fro his brother’s perverted eyes.“Well, Wataru, it was nice seeing you but, uh, with all due respect…” Minato reached behind him and grabbed your hand tightly. “Get out.” Minato turned his back on Wataru coldly and stared down at you, pupils so dilated you couldn’t actually see his irises anymore. He pulled your body close to him and shoved your up against the closed door of your bedroom. Throwing a dangerous smirk over his shoulder, he growled at his brother. “Now.”You didn’t even have a chance to protest as he crashed his lips into yours, sliding his tongue into your mouth with expert precision that made your head spin. Somewhere to the side, you heard hurried footsteps and the slam of your front door. Then, Minato released you from the kiss only to glide his tongue down your throat.“It should be illegal for you to look so god damn sexy.” Minato groaned as he sucked down your collarbone, licking the curves of your breasts and suckling at your hardened nipples through your bra.“Minato, that was rude… how you just kicked him out…” You scolded half-heartedly, more fixated on the movements of Minato’s mouth, now sucking at the sensitive flesh beneath your belly button, than you were about his lack of manners.“If you thought that was rude,” Minato chucked deviously as he now crouched between your legs, gently lifting your thigh over his shoulder, “then you’ll think this is positively obscene…”Minato pushed aside the red silk panties and licked your most intimate parts with a languorous, fluid action. Your breath hitched in your throat and your hands wound their way into Minato’s hair as he slowly flicked his tongue back and forth over the bundle of nerves he adored.“Minato… Minato… Oh…” You cried out his name over and over again, ever so gently rolling your hips into his mouth as pleasure consumed you.“You let another man see you like this, ___________.” Minato growled into you as his tongue’s actions went from soft to frantic. You moaned loudly, rapidly losing the ability to form words in your mind, let alone utter them. “Your body is mine, ____________, all mine… Your taste is on my tongue, your skin under my hands… only mine.” He groaned before smirking and deciding to push you ever the edge of pleasure and started, much to your body’s delight to nibble.“Sorry, I forgot my…” Wataru re-entered the house and yelped. “Oh my god! Sorry! Sorry! I’ll come for it later… oh my god, oh my god, oh my god…” Wataru left the house screaming.You and Minato, so lost in each other, hadn’t even heard him come back in. KaoruLooking at yourself in the mirror, you didn’t know what was more mortifying: what you were wearing or that you were asking confirmation from Tama.“Do you think he’ll like it?” You asked her, more out of nerves than a need for confirmation.Tama looked at you blankly and meowed.“Yeah, I think so too. It doesn’t suit me.” You sighed, running your hands down your sides, the feeling of silk beneath your palms. The bra was white lace – translucent for Kaoru’s viewing pleasure – and hanging from the underwire was baby blue silk, slitting up the middle to reveal your naval – also for Kaoru’s viewing pleasure. The panties were the same see through white as the bra and two blue ribbons dangling from the sides, tickling your legs. Sighing, you decided to go against wearing it for Kaoru. You wanted to wear something for him, to make him lust for you, but you weren’t feeling confident enough quite yet. But, not comfortable being completely naked in front of Tama, you picked her up and walked her out of your bedroom, cooing to her as you went. Walking out into the living room, you placed her on the floor and smiled down at her.“I’m home. ”Kaoru’s voice came from the front door and you whirled around, eyes wide as he walked into the living room. “Kaoru!” You squealed as he walked in. Raising his head from his phone, his blinked at you a few times before he seemed to realise what you wear wearing, his eyes slowly moving along your body.He didn’t know what to think. You seemed to shocked to see him, and you were wearing something so gloriously sexy… Kaoru found his eyes drawn to your breasts. He loved how soft they were, how the felt in his hands, how your nipples reacted to his mouth and fingertips going hard and red, how they shook when he decided to take you roughly… Kaoru noticed your nipples with a frown: they were already stiffened and reddened… If you had planned to wear something like this for him, wouldn’t you be so shocked… and why did your nipples look to thoroughly played with? Kaoru’s eyes narrowed in suspicion.“Where is he?”You stared at him for a few moments.“What?”But he was already off, he’d thrown your bedroom door open and was slamming open every door in the house, yelling about some mystery man while trembling with rage.“Kaoru! Kaoru, wait!” You scrambled after him and grabbed his upper arm. He whirled around at you and glared down at you. Reaching out he grabbed at your breasts roughly. “Ah! Kaoru!” You cried out.“Who are you dressed like that for?” He growled, rubbing his palms over sore nipples. You gasped at the sensation with the lace. “Who was teasing your nipples? Who?” He moved a hand down between your legs and rubbed his long fingers over your underwear. “Who got you so hot and…” he slipped his fingers underneath the lace and his jaw clenched. “…wet? Who?!”“You, you big idiot!” You moaned loudly as he touched you. It was slightly shameful to you that you found his anger and rough treatment so arousing but as his touch froze when he heard your words, you stared up at him anxiously.“What?” Kaoru looked at your scantily clad body once more and frowned.“I wanted to wear this for you, to make you… want me… and, and my…” You flushed harder as you spoke, feeling his intense eyes on you. “My nipples are a bit sore because the lace is kind of rough.” You blushed.“You…wore this… for me?” Kaoru repeated and you nodded. Sliding his hand out of your panties and resting his hands on the backs of your thighs he gave you a small smile. “Well, in that case…”He picked you up, loving your weight in his arms and placed you on top of the kitchen table near where you’d stopped him.“Kao…ru…” You moaned out as Kaoru’s lips caught yours, his tongue slipping into your mouth and saliva dripping from the corner of your lips. He reached behind you and pulled your bra and the attached silk off, relieving your breasts from the rough material. He trailed his mouth down and captured one of your aching nipples in his mouth, softly running his tongue over it softly and making your spine arch into him.“Only I get to suck these little nipples.” Kaoru moaned. “Only I get to make you hot and wet.” He tickled your inner thighs with his fingertips and rubbed your folds roughly.“Only you.” You confirmed, allowing your adorably possessive boyfriend to have his way with you right there on the kitchen table. Then again on the floor. And again against the wall. And again and again and again.ShuseiYour boyfriend had not paid attention to you in days. He had bought a new video game the other day and had not stopped playing it since he sat down in front of the TV with it four days ago. So, you had come to realise that extreme measures had to be taken in order for you to compete with that video game. And so it was that you stood in the doorway of Shusei’s room, a dark purple lacy thong at your hips and matching purple, sequined nipple pasties at your breasts. He was facing away from you, staring at his game with utmost concentration, his gaming headphones preventing him from hearing your steady approach. Taking a steady breath to calm your nerves, you walked into the room. Plucking his headphones from his ears, you wrapped your arms around his neck from behind and pressed your lips to his neck.“Shusei~” You purred, taking his earlobe between your teeth. “I’ve got a surprise for you.” You sucked on his earlobe softly and Shusei sighed but continued playing the game.“Hurry it up, ___________ sweetie, I’m in the middle of a tough mission.” He didn’t even look around to you so you removed your arms from his neck and slowly walked around his chair to stand in front of the TV.“I think you’ll stop playing for this.” You stood with your hands on your hips and smirked.Shusei’s controller clattered to the ground. His eyes widened and his jaw slackened, his pupils dilating and his mouth going dry as he looked at you. Through the lace of your panties he could clearly see your plump lips and patch of soft hair that he adored to tug at with his teeth. Gaze slowly trailing up your soft, fleshy stomach to your breasts, bared free to him all save your nipples, Shusei could feel himself beginning to strain against his jeans as he looked at you.“You’re right.” Shusei nodded blankly as you climbed into his lap. “The game can wait.” He went to kiss you but you pushed his face away.“You’ve been bad, Shusei.” You whispered, smiling sweetly at Shusei as he began to blush.“Oh my god, _____________…” Shusei cried out as you ground your hips into his, feeling his growing erection rubbing against you. “Have you been bad, Shusei?” You asked, taking his hands in yours and running his palms over your waist up to your breasts as you deliberately thrust against his hips.“Yes, _____________, I’ve been bad…” Shusei’s low voice should’ve been a warning to you, but before you noticed the darkening in his eyes, it was too late. “But you’re playing unfair, so naughty!” He lifted you and tossed your body onto the bed, stripping off in a matter of seconds before pouncing back onto you. Kissing at your lips and your neck, he tore the thong from your body and slid a finger inside you, pumping it back and forth roughly.“Sh-Shusei… More…” You begged him as you trembled in his lap. “I don’t care if it hurts, I need you inside me.” You cried out as he withdrew his fingers and rubbed the wetness from his fingers over his pulsing member.“Naughty ___________, my sweet, naughty little ______________.” Shusei chuckled, rubbing the tip of his erection over your nether-lips. “Where did you buy these from?” He gently fingered the pasties on your nipples with an adorable expression on his face – a slightly out of place expression considering what he was doing between your thighs. “You didn’t let another man see you buying these did you?” He asked, his voice low and growing hoarse as he pressed his face between your breasts.“No… I got… them… online…” You panted, grabbing Shusei’s wrists and pinning them to the back of his chair roughly. “Stop trying to take control; I’m the one punishing you remember?” You chided with a small giggle and Shusei laughed as well planting a sloppy kiss on your lips. Shusei was about to say something but before you could, you slowly sank down – and with every prolonged inch, Shusei’s facial expression changed. First it was shock, then it was hunger, followed by pleasure then fighting for self-control, then an intense crease in his brow followed by his happy surrender, then bliss and finally, as you took his last inch within you and he was deeper inside than either one of you thought possible, his face took on a look of pure ecstasy as his eyes rolled back into his head. He groaned slightly and kissed your neck, whispering to you: “If this is your idea of a punishment, I need to be naughty more often.”ChiakiYou fastened the tie of the deep emerald silk bathrobe and walked out of your bedroom to where Chiaki sat on the sofa, his laptop on his lap and various documents spread out across the coffee table in front of him. “Chiaki?” You called out to him softly and he looked up to you, smiling as he saw your robe clad body. “You look surprisingly alluring tonight.” He teased, returning to his work while sending the occasional glance at you and over your legs.“You’ve been working for hours, Chiaki, I thought you deserved a break.” You slowly closed the lid of his laptop and picked it up and put it away, not anywhere near the sofa or the coffee table, just in case.“Yeah? And how do you think I should spend my well deserved break?” Chiaki licked his lips and looked up at you as you stood back in front of him. You were glad you were already on the same page as you reached for the tie on your robe.“I had a few ideas…” You tugged on the tie and shrugged off the robe and as the silk slipped from your skin, Chiaki’s smirk dropped from his face.The lingerie you wore was all black. The strapless lace bra pushed your breasts up and gave you an immense cleavage, the panties, the most daring panties you had ever worn in your life, were so small at the front they barely covered up your most intimate parts and the back consisted of only a small string that rested between your ass cheeks. Chiaki’s body instantly reacted to seeing you but, as he reached out to you, you turned around, turning your back to him so he could appreciate your backside. Running his fingertips over your ass, he leant forward and kissed the small of your back, using his lips to suck hard on the skin, leaving a mark.“I’ve obviously trained you well.” Chiaki grabbed your hips and slowly standing up, he reversed your positions, making you kneel on the sofa and face away from him. “Push your ass out towards me.” He commanded and you did exactly as you were told. “You’re being surprisingly obedient today.” “I just want to make you feel good Chiaki.” You moaned lightly and turned to look at him over your shoulder, your eyes wide teary and your brows furrowed slightly in insecurity as Chiaki ran his hands over your backside. Removing his hands from you momentarily to unfasten his belt, he pushed his trousers only to halfway down his thighs – too impatient to take them completely off.“I don’t think I can wait after hearing you say that, ____________.” His devilish smirk had returned and he tugged the string of your panties, revealing to him your dripping core. He stared at your throbbing lips in confusion for a few seconds before cocking his head to the side. “It seems you’ve prepared yourself for me… Did you use your fingers?” Chiaki teased, leaning his body over yours and entwining your fingers together.“You’ve been stressed out lately, Chiaki.” You whispered, turning your face to the side so you were nose to nose with him. “I didn’t want you pleasuring me like always, I just want you to feel good. I want you to use me for your own pleasure.” You admitted with a faint blush.“Pleasuring you makes me feel like a man, ____________,” Chiaki chuckled, taking your lip between his teeth. “And pleasuring you makes me feel like your woman.” You begged, embarrassed now at how he prolonged your wait. “Please, Chiaki, I’m ready for you so just take me already.” Chiaki looked at your face, stunned at your sudden desire to pleasure him and only him just so he could unwind. Wondering what he had done in life to deserve a woman so selfless and generous as you, he took his erection into his hands.Kissing your neck, he ever so gently pushed inside you and both of you gasped: you at the feeling of him entering you and him at the feeling of your tightness. He squeezed your hand, running his thumb over your knuckles and he bit into the flesh at your neck, as though he were a wolf mating with its partner.“You haven’t prepared yourself enough, ____________, your fingers aren’t as long as mine.” His voice came out as a rough whisper, his tongue darting out to lick the skin at the back of your neck as he listened to your soft cries. “Sorry, I know you wore this and prepared yourself so I could feel good but… I want to make you scream in ecstasy.” Chiaki growled and brought his hips back only to slam into you, making you moan. Feeling his hands grip at your hips to ensure his thrusts were as hard as possible, you knew you were in for a very rough night – not that you minded in the slightest.AkiyoshiHe’ll love it, Tam had said, just forget about your insecurities, she had continued, it’ll do wonders for your sex life, she had assured. You didn’t have any problems with yours and Akiyoshi’s sex life. You actually found it a bit too intense at times, though you never took control, and when discussing your bodily insecurities with Tam, she convinced you to do something daring.And you were now regretting it.As a teenager, you had developed stretch marks. It was a normal thing. Most girls get them. But the faint purple and red lines still nagged at you and it was partially because of them – partially due to how fleshy you were in places – that made you insist on keeping the lights to a minimum whenever Akiyoshi made love to you. But Tam had been convinced that this was the perfect thing to make him lust for you even more so than he already did.That was how you came to be wearing the pale pink lingerie. The balconette bra could barely contain your breasts and the cute boy-short panties left little to the imagination in their translucence. Dangling from the middle of the two cups of the bra was a small diamante charm and woven into the material of the panties were small sparkles. It was feminine and beautiful and a little cute but you still felt uncomfortable as you looked at yourself. Your hips were too wide, your stomach too fleshy and your thighs too thick. Not to mention those stretch marks and the little dimples of cellulite that you also knew were normal but couldn’t help sighing at whenever you saw one.“________________?” Akiyoshi called out to you, approaching from behind and watching you observe yourself in the mirror. “What’s with this?” He smiled as he placed his hands on your waist and kissed your shoulder, referring to the underwear.“I thought I’d wear them for you.” You sighed, frowning at yourself as Akiyoshi wrapped his arms around you, pressing your body into his.“Does your seduction plan involve looking so sad? If so, you need to rethink your strategy.” He smiled and slid his hands down your sides, resting his palms on your hips and placing soft, damp kisses up your neck before taking your earlobe into his mouth, letting his teeth dig into the flesh a little, nipping you.“I wasn’t actually going to go through with it.” You admitted and Akiyoshi stopped his assault on your neck immediately. “Why not?” He looked at your reflection in the mirror you were stood in front of and smiled sweetly. “You look adorable, I especially like this.” Akiyoshi’s fingers trailed up your stomach and fingered the diamante charm dangling from between your breasts.“But I don’t want to be adorable. I want you to find me sexy.” You bit your lip and looked down at the floor in shame. Akiyoshi dropped his hands back to your hips and waited for you to explain. “I don’t understand what you find so attractive about me. I’m so squishy and have marks and… you’re so… lean and muscled and tall and I’m just stood here like a freaking potato.” You sighed, feeling Akiyoshi’s hands trail down your legs as he dropped to his knees behind you.“These marks?” He trailed a fingertip down one of your stretch marks and you shuddered, slightly out of embarrassment.“Yes. They’re –”“Beautiful.” Akiyoshi finished, kissing each one softly. “Every single part of you is beautiful, ___________: every curve, every dimple, every mark, every scar… all of it. I love all of it.” He rose back to his feet and turned you around, looking down at you with a gentle expression.Leaning down slightly, he slid an arm around your knees and lifted you into his arms. Carrying you to his bed, you laid you down on it gently and kissed you.His lips were soft, gentle and his tongue was hot and sweet as it gently probed your mouth in languid, fluent motions so sexily slow that your body began to throb.Taking your hand in his, he placed your palm over his chest.“Feel this heartbeat?” He asked and you nodded. “That is what seeing you looking so alluring does to me.” He maintained an intense eye contact with you as he slid your hand down his body until he rubbed your hand against his crotch and you gasped. He grunted slightly and for a few seconds he simply used your hand to pleasure himself through his trousers. “Feel my cock?” He growled softly and you nodded again, flushing. “Feel how hard it is? How it’s pulsing and straining against my trousers? This is what you do to me, _____________.” He moaned and closed his eyes, leaning down to kiss you again as he undressed himself.That night, he took care to point out everything he loved about your body and everything he didn’t like about his own. He showered you with adoration and as you lie, sweating and writhing underneath him, you watched as he slid down your body, resting casually between your legs as he licked every mark he could find, sucking on scars and nibbling on fleshy parts of your body. He groaned and moaned and growled in pleasure as he felt all over your body and never in your entire life had you experienced such intense pleasure or love than you did in his arms that night.Tsumugu“Hey, Tsumugu?” You call out to him, fidgeting nervously where you sat on the bed.“Yeah, baby?” He called back from somewhere within the house.“I need you.” You yelled out to him, adjusting your position for what seemed like the thousandth time.Sat in the centre of the bed, you lay resting against the pillows, your arms spread wide as if to welcome your boyfriend directly into your arms.Listening, you heard an irritated sigh followed shortly after by heavy, thudding footsteps. Smiling as you imagined his possible reaction, you felt a bubble of excitement begin to tingle in your core as the door handle turned.“What?” Tsumugu snapped slightly.But then he blinked. And he saw what was lain out before him. And all of his irritation diminished.Looking at your body, Tsumugu was extremely pleased to see the white lingerie. There was something about a woman in white, let alone his woman in white, Tsumugu thought, that give you a certain image of purity and innocence that, as a man, he felt the sudden urge to defile and taint. The lingerie was simple, just how Tsumugu liked it. Made entirely out of lace and cotton, the panties revealed enough to make Tsumugu’s heart pound but hid away the one place he craved to see, feel, smell and taste the most. The bra fit you perfectly: you weren’t spilling out, you weren’t left with a gap between breast and cup, and it enhanced your natural cleavage. The only problem Tsumugu had with it, was that he couldn’t see your sensitive places and he had the sudden desire to revel in his most animalistic of passions, tearing the underwear from your body and ravishing you as you so deserved. But the slow movement of your hand stopped him.“I bought some strawberries from the store today.” You giggled softly, slowly extending your arm to pick up a juicy, ripe strawberry from a bowl on the bedside table. “I thought you might like to eat some with me.” You offered, watching as Tsumugu tried to swallow his nerves and maintaining eye contact with him as you bit into the strawberry. Not even attempting to prevent it from happening, you allowed the deep pink juice to travel down your chin, humming as it glided down your throat and began to pool at your cleavage.“______________… You, um…” Tsumugu started to blush as he stared at your strawberry stained breasts and you feigned innocence and sighed.“I’m such a mess.” You began to smirk and, after placing the half-eaten strawberry back into the bowl, you brought your index finger to your breasts, running your fingertip over the juices that had collected there before running your tongue along your skin, sucking on your finger and moaning as you did so.Tsumugu watched the scene unfold – the most erotic thing he had ever seen you do in the history of your relationship. Moving as though entranced, he crawled onto the bed and brought his lips to your breasts.Running the flat of his tongue over the juices, her couldn’t help but let out a groan as you arched your body upwards to press against his.“Shittin’ hell, baby, y’ really know how t’ get a guy riled up, don’tcha?” He let out a low moan as he reached behind you to unfasten the clasp of your bra. You giggled and put your hands on his shoulders.“Only you, Tsumugu.” You took your lip between your teeth and pushed slightly on Tsumugu’s shoulders, getting on top of him. Still in awe at the white lingerie you were wearing being stained pink by the strawberries, Tsumugu was hypnotised by your every movement: all he could do was stare in fascination as you stripped him, kissed and licked over his chest, nibbled on his nipples – made his spine arch and his limbs tremble as you began to grind your hips against the tightness in his jeans. Taking his hands in yours, you ran his palms over your body, and Tsumugu couldn’t hold back the slightest of whimpers as he saw in your eyes just how much you craved his love inside of you. As he let you make love to him again and again, all Tsumugu could think of was the wonder of what he had done in order to warrant such a delicious woman as you.And there you have it! It feels good to get the creative juices flowing again - writing juices, not strawberry ;) - so I really hoped you liked this!

Blindspot (Eisuke X MC fanfic)
nitelotus:
5 Years before…
“Stop this nonsense, Selina!” Eisuke argued with her. All he wanted was a lovely night alone with her. The expansion to London took a lot of his time. This was his first time home in Tres Spades for weeks. And this is what he has to come home to? Her anger? Her jealousy?
“Is this how you see this? Nonsense?” She replied back in anger. The weeks that he had been gone has indeed been lonely. No phone call, no pages, no email. With how often that pager kept pinging when he was home, one would think that a little peace and quiet would be welcomed. But that was a part of their relationship too. The other guys tried to occupy her time, took her out to dinners and movies. They were sweet but nothing and no one can replace Eisuke.
And when he is finally home, they were fighting.
Selina crossed her arms and hugged herself tightly.
He moved towards her as she stepped back once.
The surprise in his face lasted a second before it switched to anger and then it was gone. “Se…”
Her phone rang before he could complete her name. Without hesitation, she answered it in front of him.
Eisuke heard none of her conversation.
She ended the call. “I gotta go,” was all she said and turned to leave.
He wondered who it was on the other line. All he could discern from that call was her skin turned real pale.
The next day, she was gone.
—————————————————————————————-
5 Years later….
Tomorrow, Eisuke is leaving for London. Tres Spades London has finally come to fruition after years of dealing. He invested all his time and effort into this project.
Plus it helped with the pain.
The first year, it was all about her. Tracing her. Tracking her. Finding her. He almost ran the other guys to the ground, including himself, in trying to locate her. That night replayed on his mind over and over. Other than that sudden paleness after that phone call, there was no other clue as to what caused her to suddenly disappear. The first few days, he wondered if she was kidnapped. Eisuke had made enemies and they would be on the lookout for any weakness that he might have. He would pay any amount to have her recovered. But there were no calls or letters that came for her safe exchange. Even Soryu and Mamoru using all of their contacts were not able to find her.
As if she disappeared from the face of the earth.
Days turned into months turned into years. Life moved on. Eisuke tried to as well. He wanted to continue on looking for her but the auction was suffering, business was declining and he prided himself in being a businessman first and foremost. So Tres Spades London happened and became his life mission. Every waking moment, if he went to sleep, was devoted to Tres Spades. She would have been so proud.
Selina.
Her name was a prayer, a whisper on his lips. The only thing that left a reminder that she even came to his life was that wolf phone charm that he kept hidden in his jacket pocket. A memento she said that reminded her of him. A sheep disguised as a wolf. They both laughed at that.
The lights passed by as Eisuke drove himself to a nearby coffee place. It has been getting a lot of attention lately and he wanted to see if this was a business he could acquire for Tres Spades. He was always on the lookout for the best. Being a connoisseur of coffee, he would be the perfect judge if this place was worth it or not.
The coffee shop was a hole in a wall and it was already close to midnight but there were still people coming in and out of the shop. Eisuke parked his car nearby and strolled to the front before heading inside. The lights were muted inside but bright enough to see solo people, singles and groups enjoying each other’s company and their hot beverage. Outside, wooden benches served as extra seats for anyone that cannot be accommodated inside.  Homey but nothing extraordinary. Well, it was no use just standing out here. A bell tinkled as Eisuke stepped inside and ordered his coffee.
It was interesting to say the least. The coffee differed from his usual but he could see the potential. Eisuke glanced at his watch. They might be closing soon and he had to pack for his trip later on in 5 hours. Not that he had to pack much since he almost never unpacked. He pushed his chair with an intent to stand when the bell by the door tinkled indicating a new customer came in.
“Hey, Selina! You’re kinda late!” One of the baristas yelled out to her in greeting.
Did he hear them right? Was it really her?
The woman before him had entirely black hair, tied into a tight bun at her nape. Gone was the brown tresses that he quite adored. She was dressed in a white blouse, long denim skirt and navy sandals. She had lost some weight. But that figure, that smile, her gestures. It was HIS Selina.
The most disturbing thing was she had a guide stick in front of her and black glasses covered her eyes.
Blind! She was blind! When did this happen? How?
Her soft laughter brought him back from the shock of seeing her appear so suddenly.
“You know I couldn’t help and stop by, Jun. I need my coffee fix to wind down from the evening,” Selina replied back as she neared the counter. Her banter with the barista became muted as he was too far away to hear their conversation. Too many questions ran through his head. Where was she for these years? What happened? Was she just hiding in plain site? Questions only she had the answer to.
And this time, Eisuke Ichinomiya would not lose her. He would get the answers he wanted. Always.
Not a second too late as he recognized the tinkle of the bell and she was already out of the door. He stood from his seat, intent on not losing her a second time. Once out of the door, he looked left to see if she went that direction. A blind woman can’t walk that fast, can she? He glanced to the right and saw an end tail of her denim skirt. She had already turned into an alley. Eisuke hastened his steps. He heard a scream. His steps turned into full on sprint.
“SELINA!” He cried out to her.
The cup of coffee laid on its side, spilled. Her walking stick was next to it. A few steps ahead, Selina sat on the street, propped against the wall. It was dark in this alley but the red stain on her blouse indicated that she was hurt. The shades was knocked away from her closed eyes.
Eisuke was afraid to touch her and at the same time, he needed to make sure. He reached out with a hand and gently touched her temple. Selina winced but remained unconscious. Going against all protocol on moving an injured person but not wanting to leave her, Eisuke gathered her in his arms. She moaned once in pain and then settled into silence. Thankfully, he did not park too far. He juggled with opening his car door and then gently settling her in the passenger seat. Eisuke secured her seat belt. “You’re going to be ok. I got you now,” he whispered to her, to himself. He will try very hard not to speed since being in an accident won’t benefit him or her. Within his car, he made the call to Soryu to make the call for Luke for him. He woke up the IceDragon’s leader but he is used to his calls by now.
“I found her, Soryu. I finally found her.” He then added instructions to rouse Luke and be ready to treat her.
Once the phone call was done, Eisuke risked another glance at the passenger seat. She was pale, injured but alive. The questions would have to wait after she has healed.
————————————————————-
Under a streetlamp, a man flipped his phone open and made a call. It was answered in one ring.
“She’s with him,” was all that was said.
Author’s note: This is my first ever Voltage fanfic. I, personally, have not played Eisuke’s route so please excuse any inconsistencies with his character. I tried to get this as close as I can get based on other wonderful writer’s fanfics about him. Reviews and comments are loved! Thank you for reading!
To say that this was your first fic, it is absolutely amazing! I think you’ve got Eisuke’s character quite will (believe me when I say this is a major compliment because Eisuke is my number one bias :3) so don’t worry about that. For me, I found that there is a bit of confusion about what happens to Selina - the injury and the guy at the end especially - but if there’s a follow-up then confusion can be good, and in this case I think it’s enough to keep you wondering but it is still a bit unclear. I look forward to reading more from you :)This truly was a great fic by the way, kudos to you :D

But, better late than never, so… I hope you like it!~Tsumugu Kido - Give It To Me (NSFW)“Sarah.” His voice came out cracked and hoarse. “Stop.” He reached out, grabbing her arm as she went to take some clothes from her chest of drawers. She shook off his grip and let out a strangled sob. “Please, baby, stop.” Tsumugu tried to stop his own sobs from erupting as he watched her throw her clothes into the suitcase.“Why should I?” Sarah whirled around with her arms full of clothes and looked at her husband, startling when she saw his eyes filled with tears. “Tell me one good reason why I shouldn’t leave?” “’Cause I love you! I’m in love with you, Sarah! Please, stop this!” Tsumugu raised his voice, desperation and panic settling in his chest.“Do you?” Sarah shot back, tossing her clothes into the case and whirling around to face him, hands on hips. “Do you love me, Tsumugu?” Sarah’s face was hard, her expression merciless, but Tsumugu knew that she was falling apart on the inside, knew that she was feeling just as torn up and broken as he was at the prospect of her leaving.“The hell you talkin’ bout? O’course I love ya, stupid woman!” Tsumugu took a step closer to her, was taken aback when she winced.. “I’m so in love with ya, it hurts. Right here. You’re killin’ me, Sarah.” His voice wobbled as he yelled, resting his hand over his heart.“Then why won’t touch me, Tsumugu!?” Sarah whispered back, tears streaming down her cheeks. Tsumugu froze, blinking at his wife in shock. The softness of her voice hit him like a slap in the face. Maybe it was because she seemed so exhausted that her quiet voice scared him more than her yells did.“What?” Tsumugu murmured.“We waited until we were married to make love, Tsumugu,” Sarah laughed bitterly, looking down at the suitcase with a mound of clothes in it. “And when we finally made love on our wedding night, I was sure that we’d be happy forever.”“And we will be, if you just stay!” Tsumugu interrupted but Sarah held up a hand to silence him.“We’ve been married for six months, Tsumugu.” Sarah told him. “And we’ve had sex once. Ever since our wedding night, you refuse to touch me.” Sarah looked back up at Tsumugu and took a shaky breath. “Is there someone else?”“No! God, no!” Tsumugu shook his head wildly, wondering how things could’ve gone so wrong. “I’m in love with you, Sarah, only you.” He spoke now not in his Kansai accent, but properly, as if to convey how serious he was. “Then how come no matter what I do you won’t touch me?” Sarah asked him, the tears starting to well in her eyes again. “I walk around wearing next to nothing, I surprise you in the shower and I go to bed naked just to press my bare body against yours but what do I get in return?” Sarah was sobbing now, the tears an endless stream down her cheeks and her rage and frustration making her voice scratchy. “Nothing! You don’t touch me and I hate it! Do you know how it makes me feel to know that you wait until you think I’m asleep and then jerk off? I am your wife, Tsumugu, you shouldn’t need to jerk off but apparently you’d rather have your own hand than my body!”“Oh, Sarah.” Tsumugu’s heart broke in his chest. He could never do right by her. Never. When he was too forceful, she got mad. When he abstained, she got mad. And now his idiocy in not knowing how to handle her with the care and love she needed, she was going to leave.“Tsumugu, I just want you to love me.” Sarah’s anger had drained and now all that was left was sadness and a desire to be comforted by Tsumugu’s embrace. Which he willingly allowed. Wrapping her shaking body in his arms, he stroked the back of her hair, resting his chin on her head and whispered to her softly.“I am so sorry, Sarah, but you have to understand.” Tsumugu implored.“Understand what?” Sarah sniffled into his chest.“How it made me feel to see you wincing and flinching and screaming in pain when I first made love to you.” Tsumugu admitted with a heavy heart. “To see the fear in your eyes the morning after. Every time I tried to touch you after that you flinched away from me.” Tsumugu’s voice cracked as he spoke and he lowered his voice, feeling Sarah’s trembling stop. “You were scared of me, Sarah. Scared of my touch and of my desire so I stopped trying. I stopped trying to make love to you because you were in so much pain the first time.” Tsumugu’s cheeks flushed as he admitted the real reason why he hadn’t tried to respond to her advances.“I don’t care if you hurt me, Tsumugu.” Sarah looked up at him, eyes wide with love. Looking into those mocha orbs, Tsumugu saw an openness and vulnerability there that made his throat dry. The look of sincere trust and willingness made something stir deep in his gut. It was as though Sarah was completely submitting to him. He’d never thought before about how fragile and dainty Sarah’s womanly body was, but stood towering over her in that moment with her staring up at him so naïve and sweet… It made Tsumugu feel innately powerful and masculine in all the best ways. “Hurt me, break me, ruin me, I don’t care, I just want you to make love to me!” Tsumugu eyes widened as he listened to her, gulping in an attempt to moisten his dry throat. Sarah seemed to realise what she’d just asked for and blushed beet red. Tsumugu, on the other hand, was trying to contain himself. Seeing Sarah so submissive before him and awoken a part inside of him he hadn’t known even existed. It was a part of him that was animalistic in its needs; it craved a way to mark its territory: to stain and to taint. It hungered to pleasure and to be pleasured, to feel the woman he loved writhe and sweat and to feel her most intimate parts so hot and wet against his tongue. It was an uncontrollable beast and it was mere words away from being unleashed.“Sarah, don’t say things like that if you don’t mean it.” Tsumugu’s voice came out as a low groan, hands started to shake in his effort to keep control over his urge to grab her flesh and bury himself in her womanly depths.“I mean it, Tsumugu.” Sarah’s words, though not intended, put the key into the lock on the beast’s cage. Tsumugu stared at her intensely, wondering if she’d change her mind. “Please, Tsumugu, take me.” The key was turning. “I’m begging you, Tsumugu, give it to me.” And then the beast was unleashed.Crashing their lips together so violently that Sarah stumbled backwards, falling back onto the bed, Tsumugu growled low in his throat. It was Sarah’s fault for saying those things to him. He was hungry, depraved and beast within him wanted to ravish and to devour. Forcing his tongue into her hot mouth, Tsumugu ran his hands down Sarah’s body, feeling the way her body curved and arched into his palm, trailing his fingernails down her skin in a way that made her shiver. He shoved her body further up the bed but remained near the bottom. Ragging her jeans from her body, Sarah was gasping for breath as Tsumugu roughly undressed her, taking no care or time to build up to the moment when, for the first time in six months, they’d see each other naked. There would be time to marvel in her bare body later, Tsumugu knew, for now all he cared about was the stirring in his hips and the need to fuck his woman, teach her how much he craved her heat.“Ts-Tsumugu… Slow down…” Sarah breathed as Tsumugu crawled up her body, squealing a little as Tsumugu grabbed the collar of her t-shirt with both hands and pulled, tearing it open in his haste.“I’ll buy you another.” He muttered harshly, eyes going wide with the sight of Sarah’s heaving chest, her ample breasts seemingly calling out to him to suck and lick and bite. Letting out a grating hum of appreciation, Tsumugu hooked a finger into Sarah’s cleavage and yanked her bra down, making the straps rip away from the cups as he tore another piece of clothing from her body.“Tsumugu!” Sarah scolded, face flushed and eyes wide. Oh how the atmosphere had changed. First Sarah had been depressed, then angry and now… Now the feeling of Tsumugu’s mouth consumed her every thought. “I’ll buy you another.” Tsumugu mumbled into Sarah’s chest, licking over the upper curves of her breasts, slowly working his way towards a nipple. He gasped slightly when Sarah ran her fingers into his hair, encouraging his head toward the tip of her breast. Chuckling darkly, Tsumugu looked up at Sarah’s face as he flicked her pebbled nipple lightly with his tongue. She looked down at him, saw his teasing gaze and drew a lip into her mouth. Eyes darkening, Tsumugu maintained that eye contact as he slowly swirled his tongue around her swollen nipple in soft, circular motions. Sarah sighed, throwing her head back and wondering how she could be receiving so much pleasure through her breasts. Little did Sarah know that Tsumugu planned on paying a lot of attention to her perky nipples. Moaning onto her nipple, Tsumugu kept on staring at Sarah’s face as he slowly took her nipple into his mouth, making Sarah squirm. “Talk to me, Sarah.” Tsumugu breathed onto her nipple, the air making her shiver. “Tell me how you feel. How I’m making you feel. Talk to me, baby.” Tsumugu smirked as her face flushed darker and he slowly sucked at her breast.“It’s like… I feel like…” Sarah was gasping harshly  Tsumugu took her nipple into his mouth and sucked. Hard. Sarah’ spine arched as she cried out and Tsumugu used his hands to force her body back down roughly, grunting as he increased the force of his suck and added to the intense stimulation by nipping the sensitive nub with his teeth.“Not so hard… Tsumugu…” She begged, her hips instinctively flexing upwards to try to get him to kiss her further down. “If you keep doing this I think I’m going to cum….” Sarah’s body was exuding heat and Tsumugu loved it. His wife was writhing beneath him, her body slick with sweat and he could practically hear the zipper of his jeans crying with the pressure being exerted onto it. But, he would have to endure this self-torture because he wanted to tease and to pleasure his wife so that her mind was lost in pleasure. “Sarah… I love your precious little nipples… Your soft breasts… They’re mine.” Tsumugu purred as he bit down onto her nipple, taking a hand to tug upwards at the other. Shock waves travelled from her breasts down to her belly button until the electrifying little waves began to pulse directly between her legs. It was an alien sensation, having her nipples played with so thoroughly. Looking down to see Tsumugu still staring intently at her, Sarah let out an unrestrained, high-pitched moan as she saw in his eyes the pleasure he achieved from controlling her.“Tsumugu… I feel… strange… as if…no… Tsumugu!” Sarah watched as Tsumugu simultaneously sucked and bit on one nipple, pinching the other with his fingernails and the world went white.It was as though every fibre of Sarah’s being was breaking apart, smashing into pieces and reassembling themselves in way that made each atom of her body burn with intensity, and she felt an overwhelming heat flow from between her legs, as though a dam in a river had been broken and all the liquid was rushing out. It was only when her breathing steadied and she came back to life that she saw Tsumugu staring at her in wonder as he slid down her body to where her womanly juices were beginning to seep from her panties. “I didn’t know you could cum just from your nipples.” Tsumugu smirked as he kissed down Sarah’s stomach, swirling his tongue around her belly button as Sarah gasped for breath, brow furrowed in confusion.“Neither did I.” She looked down at him curiously and he chuckled.“Let’s see how many times I can get you to cum before I fuck you.” He smiled, an oddly innocent smile considering the placement of his head.“Tsumugu, no.” Sarah whined, running her fingers through his hair gently as he licked gently down her lower stomach to juxtapose the impatient plead in her voice. “It has been six months Tsumugu. I just want you inside of me.” Sarah begged and Tsumugu chuckled again.“And in a couple o’ seconds, I will be.” Tsumugu hooked his fingers into the sides of Sarah’s cute little cotton panties and felt his throat go dry as the sweetly musky scent of Sarah’s arousal wash over him. And then he pulled, and the sight of Sarah’s most intimate place actually made him moan.“Then get your face up here and… oh that’s what you meant…” Sarah’s entire body melted as Tsumugu’s tongue pushed inside her, slowly curling his tongue and nuzzling her clit with the tip of his nose.When her taste hit his tongue, Tsumugu moaned against her sex. In some odd sort of way, he knew he was pleasuring Sarah but he himself also derived a surge of pleasure at feeling her twitch against his lips. At holding her thighs apart as she writhed, her back arching up from the bed as the sensations running through her veins bubbled stronger and stronger in its intensity. “Feel it, Sarah.” Tsumugu drew back reluctantly and blew a directed shot of air directly onto Sarah’s clit, making her expel a quivering breath. “My mouth on your beautiful little pussy.” Tsumugu dove back in, running his tongue over her lower lips and nibbling on the pump flesh.“Tsumugu…” Sarah’s voice echoed in Tsumugu’s ears. Every breathy moan, every pleasured whimper and every stammering cry of his name sent throbs down to his hips. And when her body’s trembling reached such uncontrollable heights, he smirked against her wetness and flicked his tongue back and forth over her clit.“My breath on your body… my tongue inside you…” Tsumugu kissed Sarah’s clit and sucked on it softly.“I feel it, Tsumugu…” Sarah gasped, body writhing as she felt something stir deep in her gut. “Oh… More!” Sarah trembled and Tsumugu brought one of his hands to where his mouth was suckling, collecting some wetness on his skin before slowly easing two fingers inside her, rubbing and curling and stretching. Sarah brought her hands to her sore, throbbing nipples and stroked them tenderly. Looking up at her from beneath his brow, Tsumugu growled like an animal as he devoured her most intimate place, sucking and nibbling and probing. He just wanted to make her cum again and he increased the pressure of his sucking and the tempo of his fingers until she did exactly that.Her body seemed to shatter, her spine arching so violently that her entire upper body was thrown up from the bed and her soft lower tummy trembled. Tsumugu watched her in awe, never having seen such erotic beauty in his entire life. Everything from the ‘O’ of her mouth, the furrow in her brow, the sweat on her temples and the flush in her cheeks made his hips ache in pain. Torn between wanting to give Sarah orgasm after orgasm and the prospect of being in severe pain as he delayed his own release made Tsumugu sigh. Watching as Sarah’s body lowered back down onto the bed, he quietly stood and finally unfastened his jeans, slinging them and his boxers down. The pain in his hips lessened slightly now that his erection was standing tall and proud out in the air and Tsumugu looked down at himself, saw his member twitching and a thin substance already leaking out from the tip.“Tsumugu… I want you to cum…” Sarah breathed, opening her eyes and gazing dreamily up at him. Her eyes travelled down to Tsumugu’s hips and she let out a small moan of appreciation of his manhood. The thick hair at the base thinned out at the top as it connected to the trail of hair leading down to his belly button. She could see the veins along the side throb in his excitement and she ran her hands down her body. “Tsumugu… I want you… I want your cum… in me and on me and all over me. Please.” She whined and Tsumugu closed his eyes. He reached over to his bedside table and retrieved a condom but Sarah lunged, grabbing it from his hand and tossing it aside.“We’re married, Tsumugu.” Sarah kissed him daintily on the lips. “Does it really matter if you get me pregnant?” She asked, kissing down his neck and chest as she lay back down, spreading her legs open for him. “How can I feel your cum inside me if you’re wearing a condom? Just give it to me, Tsumugu, give me your everything.”“You sure?” Tsumugu asked gruffly, taking his cock into his hands.“Hurry, Tsumugu, I want to feel your cock inside me, please hurry.” Sarah pleaded and everything fell away. In that moment, there was only him and her, staring into each other’s eyes in love, adoration and need. He took her body and swapped their positions. Now sat leaning back against the headboard, Sarah was straddling him, her juices running down the insides of her thighs as she hovered over his erection.“I want you to fuck me, Sarah.” Tsumugu begged of her. And then Sarah slowly sank down. While there was slight pain at being pushed inside of for only the second time, it was considerably less than the first time. Tsumugu watched as Sarah’s face contorted and she lowered herself down completely, taking all of him inside her.“You’re so… big… Tsumugu… I can feel you all the way to… Ah! My… Stomach!” Sarah rolled her hips eagerly, Tsumugu’s coarse hair rubbing against her clit as she rode his cock.“That’s it baby, take it all.” He urged, mind going blank as he heard his wife talking to him, heard the squelch of his cock entering her pussy, the creaking of bedsprings as she rode him harder, needing everything he had to offer.“More… Give me more… More… Tsumugu, more!” Sarah cried out. She was moving as hard and fast as she could but it wasn’t enough. She needed more of him. She needed to feel him thrusting into her roughly. After so long without it, she didn’t care if he hurt her. All the wanted was to feel him using her body, taking all of her, abusing her sex for his own pleasure.“You want… oh fuck… more?” Tsumugu repeated, using his own hips to add a little bump and grind to Sarah’s bounces. She was so hot and tight and wet and he didn’t think he could last very long at all. But he bit his lip when Sarah let out a scream of a moan, feeling himself brush against something small inside her. Had he just found her…? From the screams erupting from her throat as he kept hitting that spot, he knew he’d found it.“Please, hurry, Tsumugu, more… more… harder… faster… please…” Sarah’s screams were loud and Tsumugu was staring at her in awe. There was nothing cute about the face she was pulling and he loved it. “You’re such a slut, Sarah.” Tsumugu growled, grabbing her hips and harshly ramming his hips upwards, making her yelp in mixed pain and pleasure. “To want my cock so violently inside you… You’re my little slut… Mine… Mine…” He moved harder and Sarah nodded, agreeing with everything he said. The sound of his voice so gruff and low in her ear only added to the ecstasy coursing through her veins. “You want my cum?” He asked her, taking her earlobe into his mouth and biting down on the flesh, and she writhed on top of him.“Cum inside me, Tsumugu, yes!” She moaned, loving how Tsumugu was fucking her. This transcended the realm of both love making and fucking. This was something else entirely. This was something so pure and animalistic and raw while also being so passionate and full of devotion that it made Sarah’s head spin and her toes curl. “You’re cunt is tightening around me, Sarah.” Tsumugu grunted but then realised what he’d said. He looked at Sarah to ensure he hadn’t offended her by using such a term, but she only moaned in response and so he continued to talk to her. “Scream my name, Sarah.” He demanded, roughly pounding into her body again and again. “Let me know just whose cock you love so much… Whose cock do you love my slutty wife?” He grunted again and Sarah’s body convulsed.Her inner muscles clenched, constricting Tsumugu’s cock so tightly that he came instantly with her, their bodies writhing and trembling and shaking so uncontrollably that they nearly fell from the bed as the lustful spasms took control of their bodies.  Tsumugu’s cry was guttural and ripped from his throat like a lion, while Sarah’s cry was high and full of satisfaction and erotic fulfilment.“Yours…” Sarah answered finally, breathless as she remained in Tsumugu’s lap, feeling him slowly soften inside of her. “I love your cock, Tsumugu.” She rested her forehead against his chest and he wrapped his arms around her waist, resting his chin on top of her head and pressing their sweaty bodies closer together.“Was I too rough?” He asked, recalling how he had so viciously slammed into her petite little body. Sarah shook her head, breathing harshly against his chest.“No. You were amazing.” She purred, pressing a chaste kiss to the hollow of his throat.“Promise me somethin’.” Tsumugu croaked, throat dry and a little sore from how vocal he had been. Sarah made a noise of acknowledgement and Tsumugu pushed her back a bit so he could stare into her eyes. “If ever you feel… unwanted or… unloved… ever again, don’t just get ready to up and leave.” Tsumugu glanced over at the suitcase, still open on the floor with a pile of her clothes in it. “Talk to me, tell me how you’re feeling, baby. And I’ll do things to you that will make it clear just how much I hunger for you. Got it?” He peered at her face intently and she smiled bashfully, nodding.“I promise. But only if you promise me something in return.” Sarah fidgeted slightly, heard Tsumugu’s intake of breath, remembered he was still inside of her, and stilled.“Anything.” He pushed her head backwards with his nose and kissed her neck, running his tongue softly over the juncture of neck and shoulder.“U-um…” Sarah’s mind went blank for several seconds as he ever so sweetly sucked at the sensitive spot on her throat. “I was just going to ask you to promise me that… um…” She gasped as she felt Tsumugu swell inside of her, pushing her open. “You’ll never… hah… stop loving me…” She trembled as Tsumugu began to nibble at her collarbone.“I will never stop loving you.” Tsumugu confirmed, slowly pushing her back so she was laying on the bed, him placed comfortably between her legs. “I will love you in all the ways a man could possibly love a woman and then some.” He slowly began to move within her again and Sarah’s eyes closed. Smiling as he looked down at her, Tsumugu was overcome with his love for her. “I will love you everyday, in every way and if at times you don’t believe my words, I will show you with my body.” He gasped as she purposefully clenched her muscles, and he laughed softly onto her lips. “God, I love you, Sarah.” He kissed her lips and stared into her eyes as he pushed inside her, again and again. “I won’t let you go tonight, Sarah. I’m going to make love to you so hard and so passionately that you won’t be able to remember anything but my name, you won’t be able to walk tomorrow.” He wrapped his arms around her body as he rode high within her and she began to moan again. “I will make it so that at work tomorrow, you can’t move without wincing a little in pleasured soreness, remembering how deep I was inside you. You won’t be able to fidget without your bra rubbing against your nipples and remembering how I made you orgasm from sucking on them. I will make it so that you can never be satisfied by anyone other than me.” He sucked deep pink hickeys into her skin as she nodded and encouraged his words, feeling a familiar feeling begin to shoot through his shaft he unconsciously began to thrust harder again.When he came inside her for a second time, he smiled and exhaled deeply. Staining her insides with his semen, he was more then certain that Sarah would end up pregnant within the coming months. He was going to love her every night, fill her up with everything he had, he was going to give her everything, release inside her until she was overflowing with both his love and his semen. He was going to give it to her, give everything to her, until there was nothing left of him but his love for her. And there you have it @sarah-doodles! Again, I’m sorry for how long it took to get this to you but despite not having a lot of time, I wanted to make sure that this was a perfect combination of a little angst, hotness, romance and just… perfect I guess. Hopefully you enjoyed it and I loved writing these prizes not only for you but for the other 300 Follower Prize Winners too. Thank you so much for following me, I can’t wait to have another giveaway! Hope you enjoyed them all! :D

300 Follower Giveaway
1st Place Winner
Prize 5 of 6 Fan-Fiction #2
Yoo-hoo, @sarah-doodles, me again! No with the second of your two fan-fiction prizes, if you haven’t read the others you can find them all here:OTBS - Inadvertently Turning Them OnKBTBB - Seduction Makes The Bidders BlushTakuto - An Internet DiagnosisScorpio - Inside Her (NSFW)For this second fic you asked for Takao Maruyama being all blushy and adorable, and this time you’re going lingerie shopping with him! Now for this, I took a little bit of my own intentions. See, when I get married, I was thinking it’d be kind of romantic/sweet/hot for my fiancé to choose some sexy lingerie for me to wear on our honeymoon. But, something goes a bit wrong and Takao ends up in a, ahem, rather risqué location in underwear shop XD So, I hope you enjoy this and I’M SO SORRY FOR THE WAIT DX Warning: massive blush inducing overload below the cut! I’m being genuinely serious, I was blushing while writing certain sections of this, oh my god, caution, caution, caution.Takao Maruyama - Honeymoon HumiliationWalking into the store, Takao couldn’t stop the blush from spreading onto his cheeks. His grip unconsciously tightened on Sarah’s hand as he tried to search for an appropriate place to look. To the left was sexy negligee, to the right were bras and to the front were panties. Everywhere Takao looked there was something that would send his imagination reeling with risqué thoughts about the woman holding his hand.“… It’s kind of embarrassing to do this but I was thinking it’d be romantic you know?” Sarah finished, looking over her shoulder at her pink-faced fiancée. Seeing his vacant, flushed expression, Sarah smiled softly and turned to face him fully. “Takao, have you been listening?” “Huh? Uh, sorry.” Takao scratched the back of his head, his nerves showing through not only the flush in his cheeks but also the stiffness in his actions.“I was saying,” Sarah began to explain again, “that I thought it’d be sort of romantic for you to choose some lingerie for me to wear for you on our honeymoon.” Sarah admitted and, having actually paid attention this time, Takao’s cheeks flushed even darker.“You… you want me to choose?” Takao repeated uncertainly, mortified at the prospect of having to pick out underwear while trying to keep his inner perversions in check. When Sarah nodded, he put on his usual sweet smile. “You’ll look adorable in anything, I’m sure. Besides…” Takao channelled his inner Saeki and brought his lips close to her ear. “Does it really matter what you wear when whatever I choose will just end up on the floor anyway?” Sarah’s entire face flooded with heat at what Takao was not to subtly insinuating and she cleared her throat loudly.“E-Even still, I’d like it if you would at least give me an opinion of what you find… sexy…” Sarah looked away, a mixture of bashfulness and shame stirring in her stomach. All the time Takao was calling her cute and adorable. But they were getting married soon. She didn’t want him to see her as cute. She wanted him to think she was sexy. Unaware of this train of thought, Takao sighed a little and placed an ever so slightly patronising hand on her head.“I’d rather you feel comfortable, Sarah.” Takao smiled, stroking her hair gently and Sarah frowned. “Don’t go with something you think I’d like if you aren’t comfortable wearing it.” He looked at her imploringly and was shocked to see a slightly miffed expression looking up at him.“Is it so wrong for me to want to please my man?” Sarah frowned and Takao’s eyebrows rose up his forehead. Sarah wanted to please him? As much as Takao wanted to keep Sarah happy and comfortable, there was something about the idea of Sarah going out of her way to bring him pleasure that made his ego swell inside him.“Well, if that’s the case, I’d be glad to help.” Takao smiled, twining his fingers with Sarah’s and letting himself be dragged through the store while Sarah explained the lingerie to him.“The most common materials for sexy lingerie are silk, satin and lace but there’s near as damn it no limit on colours.” Sarah said, gesturing to different items made of the relevant material as she spoke. “There are baby-dolls, which act as sort of nightwear, the usual bras and panties, and then there’s the more risqué half cups, sheer cups and full body pieces.” Sarah explained, looking up to Takao who had twisted his mouth to one side in thought.“A full body piece seems like it’d take a lot of effort getting off and I don’t want to be fiddling with anything too complex when undressing you…  And I’d imagine your breasts are too ample for the half cups, you’d be spilling out of them completely…” He pondered the options carefully, deciding to put on his professional face when weighing the options. Listening to him talk about the lingerie and her body so openly and without becoming flustered made Sarah’s face burn.“Okay, so no full body, nothing complex and no half-cups.” Sarah nodded. “That narrows down your options a bit. Any colour preference?” Sarah asked, noting the way that Takao’s eyes slid around the store as though mentally assessing the pros and cons of each piece he came across.“Well, white would be typical of the bride’s innocence but I with what you did to me this morning…”“Takao!” Sarah gasped.“Maybe red would work better?” Takao finished, completely ignoring Sarah’s shock. “It’s the colour of passion, love and lust and you certainly are quite a lustful woman. And it would look excellent on your skin.” Takao reached out and brushed a finger along her cheek, flaming pink with his bold words.“So you’d like me to wear red?” Sarah looked at the selection of daring, bold and brazen red lingerie. Takao nodded firmly, confident in his decision.“I think darker colours would be better, not too bright.” Takao strolled casually over to a stand of all red lingerie. Noting the way the customers and staff stared at him in amusement as he stared intently at the selection of underwear before him, tapping his chin thoughtfully. Walking over to him and peering over his shoulder, Sarah noted how he refused to touch anything. “Deep red, burgundies, would be better than bright red I think.” Takao murmured, walking around the stand until he froze in place.Following him, Sarah bumped into the now paralysed Takao as he stared, almost entranced at a piece of lingerie. Letting her gaze fall on the piece, her eyes widened dramatically.Takao stared at the set with a drying throat and dilating pupils as he envisioned Sarah sprawled out wearing it. Takao had been completely in charge of where they were going for their honeymoon, Sarah insisting that he surprise her and that he take charge of this portion since he had so selflessly let her make most of the decisions about the upcoming wedding. Having opted for a private overwater bungalow on the lagoon overlooking Mount Otemanu in Tahiti, Takao had asked specifically for their bed sheets to be as white as snow. Picturing Sarah’s body sprawled out against the pristine sheets, olive skin inviting and body clad in this set of lingerie… it would tantalisingly reveal more than it would try to conceal. A bra made only of diaphanous black lace; he knew he would only just be able to make out the outline of the tips of her breasts. Flowing elegantly down from the fine under-wiring were two slips of deep burgundy satin, parting in a way to reveal the belly-button and to allow the eyes to feast on the black lace panties – a thong he noted – with frills of red satin around the top. Takao could just imagine crawling over Sarah’s body, feeling the satin of the lingerie on her skin and the rough lace of the cups against his chest and the staining of moisture seeping through the panties. He would flip her over as to face her ass up in the air and could revel in the voluptuous curves of her derrière that would be raunchily displayed to him with only the thin string sliding between her cheeks. Gulping nervously, Takao knew he had to see Sarah in it.“That one.” Takao said certainly, his voice low and slightly croaky from his dry throat.“That?” Sarah picked it up by the thin black straps and held it up, taking in just how sexy the piece was. She’d be mortified to wear it but she knew she would do anything to see Takao go wild with lust. She didn’t care how much money she had to spend on slutty lingerie that would only be torn and ripped: she was determined to become somewhat of a sex goddess by the time her honeymoon came around.“Yes.” Takao nodded, cheeks flushing as he realised just what it was he had been imagining in public. “Okay.” Sarah nodded her consent and found her size, folding the set over her arm. “Are we only going for a single night, or do we need to look for some more?” Sarah asked with a teasing smile as Takao’s eyes had followed the red satin and black lace lingerie as she held it with the intent to buy.“I still think lingerie is redundant. I’ll just be taking it off anyway.” Takao mumbled, a blush dusting his cheeks again as he went to wander off through the store, looking at various shades of red. “I’m only really interested in your bridal lingerie.” And that number you’re holding, he added in his mind.“Well, you’re not allowed to choose my bridal lingerie.” Sarah chuckled and Takao smiled at the idea of his fiancée going shopping for pure white wedding underwear.“Who are you going with then?” Takao asked absent-mindedly as he looked at an interesting deep purple lace number with crotch-less panties.“My best friends.” Sarah answered somewhat vaguely. Takao looked back at her suspiciously.“Not any of the guys though, right?” Takao asked, knowing that even he would be unable to handle the idea of any of the crew having these same imaginations of what Sarah would look like in these sets of lingerie.“Well, Kuni said he’d help me out.” Sarah answered simply and Takao’s expression darkened. “Kuni?” He repeated, voice uncharacteristically venomous.“He’s family, Takao, being jealous of Kuni is like being jealous of my brother.” Sarah put a hand on his shoulder and stood on her tiptoes to try and kiss his cheek, but, with their height different, her lips landed on the juncture of jaw and earlobe. “I’m going to be your wife, Takao, what more proof do you need that I’m all yours?” “My wife. All mine.” Takao repeated, smiling sweetly down at her and kissed her briefly on the lips. “I’m liking the sound of this marriage thing even more.” Though he was hugely embarrassed to still be walking around the women’s underwear store, he was also hugely ecstatic to become a husband and to know that Sarah thought so highly of his opinion and his wants in order to submit to his desires so willingly.“So, future husband of mine, what else do you want me to wear for you?” Sarah asked, loving how joyful he looked when he spoke about their upcoming marriage.Takao looked around the store, trying to contain his excitement, when his eyes landed on a doorway, thick fuchsia curtains cordoning the room off from the rest of the store.“What’s through there?” Takao asked, unsure as to what exactly stores like these contained.Sarah blanched. A damp sweat beginning to form on her forehead, she took Takao’s arm and tried to pull him away.“Oh, nothing much. Just lingerie and stuff that’s a bit more… niche?” Sarah tried to phrase it in a way other than just blatantly saying what was behind that thick curtain. She’d ventured behind that curtain only once on a dare when she was sixteen and she’d been scarred for life by some of the things she’d came across. Not noting Sarah’s obvious trepidation, Takao let his curiosity guide his feet and shook Sarah’s desperate hold off him off and walked to the curtain. Pushing one aside, he stepped into the room.Takao blinked. Once, twice, three times.And then he blushed so hard he could practically feel the steam bursting from his ears.The walls were lined with sex toys: various dildos and butt-plugs of different sizes, colours, vibration settings; handcuffs – some metal some fluffy – and ropes; blindfolds and silk ties; wide variants of lubricants with heating, cooling and tingling effects; whips and paddles and guides for sensual spanking; packages with sexy role-play lingerie ranging from nurse to angel, from policewoman to stripper; collections of pornographic videos made to spice up a couple’s sex life; cock rings of a variety of sizes and colours; flavoured condoms, ribbed condoms, thin and coloured condoms; nipple pasties and clamps, sparkled and with tassels; ball gags and synthetic leathers; blow up dolls and masturbator stimulators. In the centre was a collection of poles available for at home installation as well as tables of male lingerie too – thongs and ‘cock-socks’ and things called ‘penis plugs’ that Takao didn’t want to think about for too long. It was a sexual deviants playhouse. And Takao certainly was not a sexual deviant. I hope seeing this doesn’t awaken something in me… Takao thought as his eyes fixated on a particularly nasty looking metal and leather contraption hanging from the ceiling that resembled some form of medieval torture device.“Takao? Can you come out of there now?” Sarah’s quiet, whiny voice reached him from the other side of the curtain.“Sarah! Don’t come in here!” Takao’s voice was stern and slightly high-pitched. It was bad enough for him to be looking at all these sexual toys and devices but were Sarah to cast her eyes upon the wonders of this room… Takao would never be able to forgive himself for tainting her in such a way.“Hello, sir, may I help you with anything?” A man approached him and Takao frowned. He’d expected anyone to work back here to be old, sweaty and seedy but the man was about his own age and looked fairly respectable. Well, as respectable as once could look when surrounded by adult toys and vagina memorabilia. “I-uh.. I don’t…” Takao blushed, stammering and stuttering.“Ah, a first timer. Don’t be shy, take a look around.” The man gestured for Takao to talk a wander and, feeling it would be rude to barge out as fast as he could, Takao cleared his throat loudly.“Sarah, you go find some more stuff for the honeymoon, okay?” He called out through the curtain and the man stood near Takao grinned from ear to ear.Sarah felt a cold chill run down her spine when Takao told her to leave him in the room. But, trusting him, she did as he asked and went off, nervously and with her thoughts on Takao in that room, to find some sexy underwear, preferably in dark tones of red, purple and pink.Takao took a hesitant step forward, but froze as his eyes landed on a particularly disturbingly realistic vibrator.“Getting married soon, eh?” The man asked, leaning back against the counter and watching the nervous Takuto with amusement.“Uh, yeah, just under a month.” Takao answered numbly, not sure where to look.“So, wanting to make sure the spark stays after marriage?” The man asked.“We have a good enough spark already, thanks.” Takao looked down at the floor, blushing like sin and the man rolled his eyes.“There’s nothing wrong with a little bit of experimentation, you know.” He chuckled, finding Takao’s embarrassment rather amusing. “And there’s no better time to make your sex life spicy and memorable than when you’re on your honeymoon.” The man smiled at Takao encouragingly.“I don’t think I’m entirely… cut out… for this sort of stuff.” Takao gestured with shaking hands towards the vast array of hard-core tools and equipment. His eyes landing on those penis plugs again, making his face screw up in disgust, making the man outright howl with laughter.“That’s for the extremely hard-core S and M-er’s. For newbies such as yourself, I’d recommend the fluffy handcuffs or the tingling, hot-cold lubes. Easing your way into it, so to speak.” The man waggled his eyebrows a little and Takao looked at the man, unsure whether to laugh or cringe at the pun.“I’m not sure how Sarah would feel about any of this stuff.” Takao mumbled, glancing over at the nipple tassels. “That’s why there’s a safe word with things like this.” The man began to explain. “Something completely random and odd, something you’d never say during sex.” “Why not just ‘stop’?” Takao asked and the man smirked.“Some men like resistance.” The man explained and Takao blanched.“Oh.” Takao blushed, still standing near the curtains and the man sighed.“Look, the things we sell here are only to enhance a couple’s sex life or to satisfy urges when your partner is away.” The man approached Takao with a gentle smile. “There’s no commitment to trying the stuff out, even if you do end up buying something. All I know is, that the stuff here can make great sex into mind-blowing, toe-curling, spine-tingling sex that rocks a girl’s world so hard that she’s unable to go a day without craving you.” The man winked and took a step back, allowing Takao to browse more clearly and, putting back on his professional face, Takao made a determined face, nodded and took a confident step into the back room.When he emerged from the curtains, he made a quick scan and edged out of the room slowly, to make sure nobody saw him. The man who had served him had opted to give him the plain black carrier bag, for extra discretion. Looking around, he saw that you were talking to a member of staff and he decided to walk out of the store and wait outside for Sarah, twirling his carrier bag awkwardly through his fingers, toying with the idea of using them and trying to imagine how she’d react to his purchasing such… lewd… items. Takao had even paid in cash to prevent any unwanted details cropping up on his bank statements.When Sarah emerged from the shop too, large bag in hand, she spotted Takao immediately – and the bag in his hand.“Hi.” She said hesitantly, eyeing the carrier bag with utmost suspicion.“Don’t worry, it’s not what you think.” Takao decided to tell a little white lie and pointed over at the men’s clothing store across the way. “Just some ties for work.” He explained. Nodding slowly and not truly believing what her fiancé had just told her, Sarah nodded and entwined her fingers with his anyway, not wanting to ask further.“So, we’re about done with the shopping trip.” Sarah mused, looking down at her own bag with a shy smile. “How about we head to Long Island before going home?” She asked.Takao knew full well that there would be no questioning what was in Sarah’s bag and for what reasons, but the weight of his own bag felt heavy in his hand as he realised that the others might discover what he’d bought.“Sure.” Takao nodded quietly, starting to blush again.The walk to the sports bar was quiet, both Takao’s and Sarah’s cheeks burning. Takao was flustered with making plans of how to hide what he’d bought. Sarah was bashful but also curious to discover what exactly Takao had bought from that back room to try out because she knew for a fact that what lay in that bag was most definitely not suitable for work.“Sarah! My lovely honey, you look positively radiant.” Saeki blurted as they walked in to the bar, his eyes landing on Sarah’s bag straight away. “And what have we here?” His eyes lit up and his fingers waggled as he made to grab Sarah’s shopping bag.“No way!” Sarah laughed, yanking the bag away from his eager hands. “What is in this bag is for mine and Takao’s eyes only.” Sarah giggled, cheeks warming a little.“Ooh, did you go pick out underwear together?” Yuta’s wide eyes sparkled as he looked up at Takao, his face deceptively innocent.“Leave them alone, guys, come on.” Kuni chuckled, nodding his hello to Takao and smiling at Sarah widely. Saeki and Yamato, however, were not going to let the topic drop that easily.“But, Kuni, Sarah’s your niece after all.” Yamato pointed out. “Surely you ought to check what she’s bought to make sure Takao’s not trying to take advantage of her naïveté.” Yamato looked over at Takao with an amused smile but Takao knew that Yamato’s teasing would bear no fruit. Saeki’s on the other hand…“Oh, my beautiful honey, I would love to see what you picked out.” He looked at her pleadingly and Takao’s face grew stern as they sat at the bar. “After all, I bet you didn’t think to try them on. How do you know what you picked out will suit you?” Saeki asked.“I picked them out for her, Saeki.” Takao’s voice was low, threatening and a warning.“You picked out Sarah’s lingerie?” Ren’s voice came from the other side of the room where he had been rudely awoken from his nap. Dragging his feet over to the bar, he decided to join the conversation. Takao blushed.“Y-yes.” Takao stammered and Yamato laughed.“I’m sure your honeymoon’s going to be really exciting then.” Yamato commented before draining his beer glass. “Kuni, get us another and a round for these two, would you?”Takao sighed in relief, thanking the gods that the topic was now dropped. Kuni placed two glasses of shochu down in front of him and Sarah and, putting their two bags down on the bar beside them, they each simultaneously took a small sip and put the glass back down on the bar. Thinking he’d gotten away with it, Takao smiled. But his smile didn’t last long.“What’s in the other bag?” The ever-perceptive Ren asked.“Yeah, that black one. You were carrying that one, right Takao?” Yuta perked up as well and now everyone was staring at the ominous black carrier bag with such intensity that Takao actually began to fear that if they stared at it so hard the plastic would disintegrate and all would be revealed.“Oh, we bought some ties for Takao to wear to work after the honeymoon.” Sarah jumped in quickly, seeing Takao’s pale face. “He’s had the same ones since we started dating so I thought it’d be nice to get some new ones.” Sarah took another sip of her shochu and smiled at Takao warmly. He nodded at her and smiled back.“Are you sure?” Saeki frowned, narrowing his eyes at the bag. “It looks a little too… bumpy… to be ties.” Takao glanced down at the bag and saw that it was quite a bumpy bag. His instinctive urge was to reach out and grab it but Sarah’s hand caught his wrist before he could.“It’s probably just the tags.” Sarah thought on her feet as she looked down at the bag too. “Or maybe it’s the necklace I bought. Is it really necessary to go through every single thing we decided to buy? Come on, guys.” Sarah chuckled, lying with ease and rolling her eyes.“I guess it isn’t really necessary…” Yamato mumbled, but had cocked his head to the side while staring at the bag.“Here, Takao, have some more shochu.” Kuni appeared with the bottle and gestured for Takao to hand him the glass. Taking it, he went to pass it to Kuni and Kuni went to take it. However, Kuni’s grip faltered and the glass dropped and, flailing to try and catch it, he knocked the shopping bags from the bar.And their contents spilled onto the floor.Sarah’s purchases remained anonymous, boxed and wrapped up in tissue paper.Takao wasn’t as fortunate.His eyes widened and his breath caught in his throat as the contents of the black bag had scattered over the floor.“Fuck.” Takao cursed.“Well, well, well… Look what we have here.” Saeki smirked.“…” Ren stared, wide-eyed and slack jawed.“Oh my.” Yuta’s cheeks flamed.“What are those?” Yamato cackled, pointing at the things on the floor, laughing.“I hope you don’t intend to use those… things… on my niece.” Kuni growled.Those things that Kuni was referring to included two sets of handcuffs, a bottle of warming lube, a silky burgundy blindfold, vibrating nipple clamps and two small, guides to ‘nipple-gasms’ and ‘sexy, sensual, spanking’.Sarah’s hands were covering her mouth as she stared down at the floor. Takao’s neck upwards was flushed bright red and his entire body was shaking with humiliation. Hearing Kuni’s words had really done it for him. How could he have bought those things with the intention to use them on Sarah: Sarah who was so sweet and trusting and innocent? Takao’s intentions had been good, he wanted to broaden his horizons to make sure that he was capable of giving you all kinds of pleasure in the world. But now… Now he just felt dirty and perverted and horrid. “I didn’t know plain ol’ Takao would have it in him.” Saeki laughed loudly, and Yuta joined him. Ren’s expression was thoughtful and Kuni’s face had on it an expression of mild disgust. “Who would’ve thought that vanilla Takao would go for things so deviant?” Yamato mumbled, a small frown creasing his forehead as he looked at the floor.Sarah looked at Takao worriedly, noting how he was silent, burning red and trembling with mortified shame. Eyes flicking between the guys, all laughing and mocking Takao, and to her sweet, sweet fiancé, Sarah’s embarrassment over Takao’s raunchy buys soon morphed into anger towards the other guys. So what if Takao wanted to experiment a little? So what if he wanted to try new things in order to make them both feel good? So bloody what?“Come on, as if Takao would actually have the balls to use this stuff.” Saeki chuckled in his teasing, unaware of Takao’s tensing jaw as he felt his humiliation make his eyes start to sting and also unaware of the line he was crossing.“It’s all so wrong.” Kuni spat, shaking his head in protective disgust. But what he said next made Sarah seethe. “Even if he did, there’s no way I’d let him use that stuff on my niece.”Sarah bolted up, glaring daggers at all the guys and she crouched on the floor, carefully putting the sets of handcuffs, bottle of warming lube, silky burgundy blindfold, nipple clamps and the guides to ‘nipple-gasms’ and ‘sexy, sensual, spanking’ back into the black bag, returned her lingerie to that bag and placed them back on the bar and whirled around. Grabbing Takao’s shoulders, she spun him around, straddled him in his chair and crashed her lips against his.All the guys fell silent as they watched Sarah plunge her tongue into Takao’s mouth, sucking his tongue and biting his lips and breathing into his mouth hotly. Everyone watching started to blush and Kuni’s eyebrows rose up his forehead considerably. Grunting a little as Sarah’s hands moved from his face, to his neck and down his chest, resting on his tight abdomen. When she finally drew away from him, she looked at his swollen red lips, wet with her saliva and smiled.“Don’t listen to them Takao.’’ Sarah smiled and kissed his nose sweetly. “They’re just too immature to fully understand that introducing new and kinky aspects into a relationship requires full trust and commitment. And, besides, what we do to each other in our bed is of no concern to them. So, we’ll do as we so please. And if what pleases us is ‘sexy, sensual spanking’ then that is what we’ll do.” Sarah’s lips twitched into a grin as she remembered the name of one of the guides. She stroked Takao’s hair gently, running her fingers through the silky strands as she soothed his trembling. The other guys watched Sarah and Takao with guilty expressions and Kuni sighed, knowing that the little girl he once knew was now a woman – Takao’s woman – and it was only natural for her life in the bedroom to be growing in intensity.“The only question is,” Sarah, looked at Takao and smirked at him deviously, and said something that made scoff and his shoulder shake in laughter. “Which one of us is going to do the spanking?”COULD YOU IMAGINE THE HORROR?!?! I was laughing and blushing and nearly crying as I saw my innocence flying away as I had to do research for this, so I hope you’re not disappointed, @sarah-doodles and very much hope the wait was worth it! Again, I’m so sorry for the wait and I hope you got my message personally apologising to you. I’m hoping to get your final prize up within the following week :)

I’m going to go get changed for bed.” She stepped back and smiled as Eisuke made a small noise in half-hearted acknowledgement. Moving slowly, Sarah tugged out her ponytail and fluffed up her hair so it hung loosely around her face. She then proceeded to move around to the front of Eisuke’s desk. Standing right in front of him, Sarah slowly unbuckled her jeans and shimmied out of the fabric. Eisuke glanced up and frowned a little but, determined to finish his work, he pretended not to notice the swaying of Sarah’s body.Unimpressed by Eisuke’s refusal to look at her, Sarah began to hum a low, sensual tune as she slowly stepped back and moved her hips playfully from side to side. Gulping as he looked at her, his gaze hidden by the forward falling of his hair, he watched as Sarah kicked her jeans to the side and smiled over at him as, shaking her hips, she began to tug at her t-shirt, revealing to him her soft curves and making a hot sweat form on the back of his neck.“Sarah… Stop.” Eisuke felt the heat rise in his cheeks as she threw her t-shirt over at him, the fabric landing, conveniently, over his lap as he raised his head to look at her.“Eisuke, are you getting shy on me?” Sarah taunted, reaching behind her to unhook the clasp of her bra. “Your cheeks are going all pink… You’re looking all hot…” Sarah waited to let the words hang in the air before tossing her bra at him. “And bothered.” She finished.“Just… go to bed.” Eisuke blushed, watching Sarah stand there in all her nearly completely naked glory. Trying his hardest to avert his gaze from the peaks of her breasts, Eisuke’s cheeks began to flame. Though those alluring breasts of hers alerted him to how cold the air was in the room, Eisuke couldn’t feel anything but the sudden warmth in his cheeks and the throbbing in his hips. Noticing how embarrassed and shy he was becoming, Sarah couldn’t help but giggle as she stripped off her panties.“Okay, Eisuke, goodnight.” She held her panties in her hand before backing up to his bedroom. “I love you.” She called out before tossing the panties directly at Eisuke, making them land on his laptop, the corner poking out through one of the leg holes.“I’ll be there in a minute.” Eisuke stated blankly, eyes fixating on the panties now on his laptop as he slowly stood up, loosened his tie and coughed through his embarrassment, leaving his work behind in order to go and punish that damned little tease of a girlfriend of his.Soryu“Soryu! I, um, wasn’t expecting you here tonight.” Sarah said as she let her boyfriend into the apartment. “Did… Oh God, did I forget that we had plans or something because if I did I am so sorry!” Sarah panicked and her boyfriend simply chuckled.“What? Can’t a man drop by his girlfriend’s unannounced from time to time?” Soryu laughed, shrugging off his blazer and folding it neatly over the side of Sarah’s armchair. “Besides, I’ve had a really stressful day at work today so I just thought I’d drop by. Seeing you really helps me unwind.”“Yes, of course you can! I just…” Sarah looked down at herself, prepared for bed, and blushed. “I really wished you’d called first.” “Why, what’s…” Soryu followed Sarah’s gaze as she looked down at herself and, for the first time, Soryu, a usually perceptive man, noticed what his girlfriend was wearing. She wore one of his t-shirts, one he’d left over a couple of months ago and never thought to get back. But she wore nothing else. Of course, it was so big on her that it covered everything completely, but Soryu could see outlines… Outlines that he loved and adored but outlines that he knew Sarah would slap him for gawking at.“Well… Might as well make the most of it and make you feel better.” Sarah muttered before looking up at Soryu and smiling. “Sit.” Sarah demanded, placing a hand on Soryu’s chest and pushing him down into the armchair.“Uh, Sarah?” Soryu questioned, frowning.“Shh…” Sarah smiled, reaching down for the hem of the t-shirt. “I’ll help you…” Sarah looked down at Soryu with a knowing smile. “… Unwind.”Soryu’s eyes began to boggle as she lifted the hem of  the t-shirt up and, just as he began to see things that would drive him crazy, out of basic respect for her and for her dignity, Soryu couldn’t help but raise his hand to cover his eyes.“Oh, don’t be like that.” Sarah chuckled. “Go on, take a peek.” She whispered, leaning over to press a kiss to his earlobe. “I know you want to.” She kissed his jaw teasingly before leaning back and continuing to ever so slowly strip off the t-shirt. Hesitantly, Soryu peered through a gap in his fingers – almost as though he were a teenage boy peeping on a naked girl for the first time – and felt his cheeks begin to burn as he stared at Sarah’s torso as she tossed the t-shirt to one side.“Sarah, I really don’t -” Soryu began, fidgeting.“What, Soryu? I’m helping you unwind.” Sarah climbed into his lap innocently, pulled his hand away from his face and loosened his tie, pulling it from over his head, a difficult task considering he had turned his face away and squeezed his eyes shut. “You must’ve known that by coming here this would be how things turned out.” Sarah chuckled, having never seen Soryu so flustered.“Well, yes, I just hadn’t thought it wouldn’t have been less than five minutes after I walked in.” Soryu blushed, mortified that Sarah was seeing his face turn redder than the Chinese flag. “And, you know, I kind of thought I’d be the one initiating things.”“Well…” Sarah held Soryu’s burning face in her hands. “Tonight, leave everything to me.”And as he watched Sarah get down onto her knees and unbuckle his belt, Soryu’s leant back and, in spite of his embarrassment, smiled at the glorious surprise of his girlfriend trying, rather successfully, to seduce him.Ota“Lacks skill.” Eisuke dismissed another one of the exotic dancers with a careless wave. Sat, curled into Ota’s side, Sarah watched as the guys deliberated over which exotic dancer *cough*stripper*cough* to hire for entertainment in order to win over a client.“What the hell do you mean I lack skill?” The exotic dancer complained, overhearing Eisuke’s comment. Sarah started to chuckle and, hearing her giggles, the dancer whirled. “You can stop laughing, you plain little girl.” The dancer snapped.“Who me? Sorry, I just didn’t think strippi- I mean, exotic dancing was such a serious profession.” Sarah tried to cover her mouth to stop from letting another howl of laughter out. Ota looked down at her and rolled his eyes but the dancer gasped in offence.“Oh yeah? I’d like to see a prude like you work that!” The dancer pointed to the pole and, in the mood for some amusement, Sarah stood, much to Ota’s displeasure, and smirked.“Fine.” Sarah went up to the pole and shrugged off Ota’s shirt, leaving her only in a tight vest and her skinny jeans. “Sarah, sit down.” Ota sat up now, realising that Sarah was serious. “You don’t need to make a fool out of yourself, be a good Koro now-”“Ota, hush up.” Sarah smiled at her boyfriend, making him sigh in anger, and she turned back around to the dancer. “You lack skill, because you struggle to manoeuvre around the pole.” Walking in a circle around the pole, Sarah recalled the time she’d learnt how to pole dance at a bachelorette party of a friend and ever so slowly began to dance.“Oh my god…” Baba gasped.“Who would’ve guessed?” Eisuke sat up, eyes alight.“Huh.” Soryu sat back and smiled.“Kid’s got moves.” Mamoru smirked.Ota’s eyes widened as he watched Sarah, her body bending and twisting and dropping and gyrating against the pole, but he remained speechless until he watched her take the pole in her hands and grind against it, rubbing her body against the metal. Seeing that, Ota let out a small noise, something akin to a whimper. The guys turned to look at him, hearing this little noise. Unaware of being watched, Ota watched Sarah’s body and, though she was fully clothed, Ota couldn’t help but picture all the naughty things in the world about her. Watching as her hands moved up and down the pole, Ota’s face grew redder and redder and he had to cover his mouth to keep from vocalising his growing arousal over watching Sarah up on the pole. Snickering to themselves, the guys volleyed their eyes between Sarah’s downright sexy dance and Ota’s furiously red face.Sarah, in the middle of twisting her body around the pole, noticed Ota’s blushing and decided to make the best of a situation she was beginning to regret finding herself in. Staring at him, she now held eye contact with him while rolling her hips against the pole.“Sarah.” Ota said into his hand as sweat began to roll down his temples as he tried to stop the naughty images rolling through his head. “Get down, Sarah, I need to see you in my room.” Watching Sarah had obviously sparked something in Ota as Sarah was now seeing as he dragged her from the stage, away from the eyes of the other guys and into his bedroom, about to make his dirty imaginations into a very serious reality.MamoruSarah was a strong woman and she could deal with a little lapse in affection from time to time. She wasn’t an unreasonable person, she understood that work could get tough. But, nearly two months had passed since they’d last been intimate and she’d had enough.“Mamoru.” Sarah said sternly, looking down at him as he closed his eyes, ignoring her.“I’m sleeping, babe.” Mamoru sighed, not even opening his eyes. If he had opened his eyes he would’ve seen the expensive and raunchy lingerie his girlfriend had bought to wear for him. Instead, he just lay there. But, Sarah was determined. After all, a woman has needs.“That’s it.” Sarah sighed, taking her hands from her hips and straddling him, hovering over him on all fours but her face wasn’t hovering over his. “Mamoru, it has been two months.” Sarah sighed, whipping off Mamoru’s belt and unbuckling the button on his jeans.“Since what?” Mamoru yawned, wiping his eyes with the back of his hands as he felt his jeans being removed. “Since we’ve had sex.” Sarah snapped, yanking at his jeans so viciously that she dragged Mamoru down the bed in the process. Eyes snapping open, he finally looked at his girlfriend.Hurrying to get him naked, Sarah’s cheeks were flushed and her lingerie had slipped, making her breasts spill out over the top of her bra. Eyebrow arching, Mamoru’s heart forgot to beat for just a second and Mamoru hurried to slow Sarah down.“Hold on a sec’, kid, slow it.” Mamoru, watching his girlfriend ignore his protests, couldn’t stop the heat rising to his cheeks as he saw how desperate she was to have him.“No, Mamoru, because I want you.” Sarah looked up at him, staring him right in the eye as she then went on to describe, rather graphically, just what it was she intended to do to him, have him do to her and then what they were going to do together. Mamoru’s eyes widened further and his cheeks grew even pinker as he tried to take deep breaths to calm his erratically racing heart.“It’s seriously been two months?” Mamoru mumbled, body relaxing as he let Sarah tug at his jeans.“Yes, would I be this frustrated otherwise?” Sarah tugged sharply and looked at Mamoru, pleading. “Now please help me take of your clothes.” She begged, trying to tug off his jeans desperately. With a red face and trembling hands, Mamoru sat up nervously and pulled off his jeans, watching as Sarah then crawled on top of him again but this time, stripped herself off completely, her actions rushed and frantic.“You’re frustrated?” Mamoru blushed harder.“Very.” Sarah breathed heavily, out of breath after having hurried to get herself naked. “Now, my blushing boyfriend, what are you going to do about that?” Sarah asked, staring down at Mamoru with a deadly serious expression.“I…” Mamoru hesitated, staring in embarrassed disbelief at his girlfriend. Mamoru’s throat went dry as he saw the look of desire on Sarah’s face. “I guess we’re going to have sex then.” Mamoru blinked a few times before rolling Sarah over, still not entirely sure what had gotten into his cute, innocent little girlfriend.Shuichi “I thought you wanted to swim.” Shuichi commented, looking down at his girlfriend. Having had an opportune vacation time, Shuichi had taken Sarah abroad and they were lying down on the beach. Sarah was using one of Shuichi’s large shirts as a cover-up as she basked in the warmth of the foreign sun.“I’d much rather be with you than alone in the sea.” Sarah opened her eyes and turned her head towards him. The look of innocence on her face made Shuichi smile and, slipping a bookmark between the pages, he put his book aside and gestured to the sea with his head.“Want to go swim with me?” He asked, sighing a little.Nodding enthusiastically, Sarah stood and went so she was standing directly in front of where Shuichi sat and slowly began to unbutton the shirt.“I bought a new swimsuit.” Sarah informed him, playfully letting the shirt slide down her shoulders. Suddenly very interested in watching Sarah remove the cover-up, Shuichi sat completely up and looked at Sarah expectantly.“Yeah?” He smirked, pushing his glasses up his nose as he looked at her.Sarah teasingly let the shirt drop farther down her arms, watching as Shuichi’s eyes trailed down her body as, inch-by-inch, she exposed her bikini. Shaking her hips as she flung the shirt at Shuichi, she giggled a little as his eyes widened, looking at her in her swimsuit. Though, his excitement was less because of the bikini and more due to the exposed flesh. Usually, when he saw so much of her skin, it was because they were about to be intimate and, seeing much of her skin now only made Shuichi think about making love with Sarah.“Do you like it?” Sarah asked, looking down at herself shyly. Shuichi stared, with wide eyes and a drying throat, over the curves of her hips, the dip in her waist and her ample breasts. Shuichi’s eyes, despite him trying not to, fixated on her breasts and hips and he gulped nervously, feeling a familiar heat rising in his cheeks as he stared at her beautiful body, the expanse of smooth olive skin against the dark material of the bikini, only highlighted by the golden glow of the sun light against her frame made Shuichi think of a sort of nude angel sent down from the heavens. The mixture of purity in her nearly naked appearance and the filth in his mind made him avert his gaze, looking stubbornly away from her as his cheeks became tinged with red.“It’s cute.” Shuichi mumbled through pursed lips, not truly thinking there was anything ‘cute’ about how she looked at all. But, what Shuichi didn’t know, was that Sarah hadn’t been hoping to be called ‘cute’ either.“Just cute?” Sarah asked, getting down on her knees and kneeling in front of Shuichi, making them at eye level with each other. From the angle she was leaning forward at, all Shuichi had to do was glance down and he’d be gifted with the sight of Sarah’s breasts spilling out of the bikini top. Just the thought in his head made his cheeks burn even brighter. Continuing to move around on top of him, teasing his eyes and his body as she straddled him, forcing him to look at her bare body and placing his hands around her waist, both of them were well aware that Shuichi’s ever increasing redness had absolutely nothing to do with the heat.Just over halfway through now, @sarah-doodles!

Prize 3 of 6 Smut Fiction #1
Halfway through, @sarah-doodles! You’ve had a headcanon and a fluffy fiction, now time for some smut! The prizes so far can be found here:OTBS - Inadvertently Turning Them OnTakuto Hirukawa - An Internet DiagnosisAnd now we have some sweet Scorpio smut on your birthday; believe me when I say he’s aiming to please ;) Hope you likey!~Scorpio - Inside Her (NSFW)I can’t believe I let that stupid fish talk me into doing this, Scorpio sighed, handing over the large, flat box. Sarah, completely unsuspecting, took the box with a look of mild intrigue. “You got me a birthday present?” Sarah asked, thrilled that Scorpio had even thought to get her a gift. She looked down at the box: white with a red, glittery ribbon wrapped around it.“You’re my woman.” Scorpio smirked, though his cheeks grew pink as Sarah made to open the box. “Of course I’d get you something.” He watched nervously as she tugged the ribbon undone and pulled it from the box, carefully.“I just didn’t think that Gods did the whole… birthday present… thing.” Sarah laid the ribbon aside and smiled at her boyfriend sweetly. Leaning over, she wrapped her arms around his neck and pressed her nose against his. “Thank you, Scorpio. I love you.” Sarah giggled a little and pecked his lips with hers.“I would thank me just yet.” Scorpio muttered as Sarah made to open the box. Placing the lid to one side, Sarah gave Scorpio a bashful smile and he inwardly groaned. Pinching the bridge of his nose, he heard Sarah unfolding the tissue paper.“U-Umm…” Sarah flushed bright red, her cheeks felt as if they were on fire as she gingerly held up Scorpio’s gift. Sarah had been expecting a number of different things – chocolates, DVDs, books maybe, possibly even a dress and a dinner date afterwards… But a gorgeous satin babydoll with floral embroidery and sequin detail to the front, sheer cups and with a matching sheer cover up robe in a soft baby pink. Looking down back in the box, Sarah let out a breathy gasp as the baby pink sheer thong caught her eye. “Do… Do you… Why did… Huh?” Sarah fumbled for something to say as she looked at the sexy negligee Scorpio had bought for her. “I… I knew I shouldn’t have got that damn thing.” Scorpio grumbled and Sarah gave a shy smile.“No! No, it’s fine, I, uh, I’m just going to go… put it away… for, uh, safe keeping…” Sarah blushed and stood up from the table and scurried off into the bedroom.Damn it, Scorpio groaned as he held his head in his hands. What the hell had he been thinking, giving his girlfriend something like that? She was so sweet and dainty and pure, there’s no way she’d wear something like that… Had he offended her by even giving her that? He knew he shouldn’t have listened to that damn fish but, deep down, Scorpio suspected that he himself would’ve loved to see Sarah wear something like that for him. How selfish he realised he was: to buy something for Sarah that, ultimately, was for his own pleasure? Of course she would be offended at him buying something so vulgar and distasteful. It had sheer cups for crying out loud. And Scorpio would never forget the mortification of having to go into a store to pick something out. The saleswoman had thought he was being cute, all flustered and uneducated in women’s lingerie while shopping for his girlfriend and Scorpio had never, in his entire life, felt as mortified as he had when he went up to pay for the silky underwear. Damn he had wished the earth would just swallow him up. And now that Sarah herself knew that he had been and bought that for her, that he gave her it as a present, he knew he would never hear the end of it. Like hell would that innocent, shy and sweet girl wear something so… so… honestly, downright slutty.“Scorpio.”Sarah’s call of his name reached Scorpio’s ears like the brush of a feather whispering through the air as it fluttered down to the ground. Her tone was low, her was pronunciation soft, her voice was breathy and her intentions were devious. Casting a glance over at the door to the bedroom, Scorpio looked up with a frown.And it was in the doorway Sarah stood.Peeking out from the doorframe, her legs daintily crossed and her hands clasped behind her back to push her chest forward, Sarah certainly had gone to put the lingerie somewhere safe, so safe in fact that she kept them on her person.“Sarah…” Scorpio’s voice was hoarse and his eyes looked her over from head to toe and back again. Slender and petite, her slight frame was emphasised in a way that made Scorpio feel innately masculine and powerful. The diaphanous robe slid from her shoulders, only drawing Scorpio’s eyes to the silky, smooth olive skin that lay beneath that pale pink robe.  Through the equally as sheer panties he could see the faint outline of Sarah’s soft hair, a tiny patch above her lips cut into a small, cutesy love heart. Through the fine, gossamer fabric of those cups, Scorpio’s eyes could feast upon the sight of Sarah’s nipples, already hardening and straining against the material rubbing against them. From behind her, Sarah withdrew one of her hands and slowly raised her arm. Drawing her bottom lips into her mouth, Sarah elongated one finger and beckoned him over to her, slowly walking backwards as Scorpio, hypnotised, stood and walked over, seemingly in a trance.Entering Sarah’s bedroom, Scorpio kicked the door closed behind him and had his arms wrapped around her waist in an instant. Reaching up to wrap her arms around his neck, Sarah stood on her tiptoes and brought her lips as close as she could to Scorpio’s ear as she could, her lips brushing against his neck as she spoke.“Can I have you for my birthday, Scorpio?” She asked, the faint whisper of her lips on his neck causing Scorpio to hum slightly in contentment. The sultry tones of her voice sent his heart pounding in his chest. Looking down at her, mocha eyes wide as saucers as she flushed in her own boldness, Scorpio couldn’t help but smirk.“You can have whatever you like.” He murmured before letting his hands glide up her body to cradle her face, bringing his face to hers and licking her lips before bringing their mouths together.The contact was soft and damp. Scorpio sucked Sarah’s top lip into his mouth, ever so slightly pressing his teeth into the flesh in a way he knew for a fact made her spine tingle. Gently pressing his tongue into her mouth, he fought the urge to smile when he heard Sarah’s soft sigh of pleasure and instead ran his tongue along hers, eliciting a tremble from Sarah’s body. Running his hands down Sarah’s sides, feeling the satin beneath his hands. Pushing his knee between her legs, Scorpio began to lead Sarah over to the bed, laying her down gently and hovering over her.“What do you want me to do?” Scorpio breathed, trying to ignore the twisting feeling of desire in his gust as he looked down at Sarah, rosy cheeked and wet lipped. “Scorpio, don’t ask me that.” Sarah blushed, clutching tightly at the material over Scorpio’s chest, her body shivering slightly. “I won’t know what you want me to do unless you tell me, Sarah.” Scorpio nuzzled into her neck, breathing hotly against her skin. Sarah ran her fingers down his chest and Scorpio fought the urge to take her as soon as he could, instead keeping up his feigned ignorance. “I… I want you to… undress.” Sarah admitted, letting go of his shirt. Scorpio smiled softly, lifting his body up and reaching behind him to pull his shirt up and off of his body. Tossing it to one side, he looked intently at Sarah as he unfastened his belt.“How far do you want me to undress?” Scorpio asked, hands hesitating over his trousers. He watched as Sarah’s eyes dropped to his hips and his heart pounded louder and louder in his chest as he saw her notice the beginnings of his arousal and lick her lips.“Keep going.” Sarah requested, unable to take her eyes away from Scorpio’s hips.Seeing her so enraptured with him, Scorpio actually started to feel a little embarrassed as he stood and slowly pulled his trousers down. Stepping out of them, he hooked his thumbs into the waistline of his boxers and he slipped them down just enough for Sarah to see the coarse darkness of his pubic hair poking out of his underwear.“Do you want me to take these off too?” Scorpio asked, his voice coming out lower than he’d intended.“Y-yes.” Sarah nodded from where she lay, her heart racing as she watched Scorpio strip for her.Scorpio pulled his underwear all the way down and bore his semi-erect manhood to his girlfriend’s eyes. Completely naked, he moved back on top of her. Unaccustomed to him being the first one to be bare, Scorpio felt a strange excitement bubbling in his stomach as Sarah dictated what they did.“Now what do you want me to do?” Scorpio smiled as Sarah placed her hands on his chest, running her fingers along his skin and feeling his warmth against her palms. “I… I want you to kiss me…” Sarah begged slightly.“Where?” Scorpio asked, head tilting to the side. “Do you want me to kiss you here?” He briefly kissed her lips. “Or here?” He slid his mouth down her throat, suckling at the sensitive skin beneath her ear. “Or here?” His voice grew hoarse as he left red marks over the skin of her chest. “Or here?” He hovered over her breasts, still covered by the flimsy, sheer fabric. Though covered, her nipples were completely visible to him, so small and hard and pink.“Kiss me all over.” Sarah panted, wanting to feel his lips on her body even more. The brief touched he’d administered before wasn’t and would never be enough for her.Scorpio lowered his face, attaching his mouth to her throat. Sarah closed her eyes and let out a low moan as Scorpio sucked at the skin of her neck, licking down the curve and nipping at the joining of shoulder to neck with his teeth. Sliding down her body even further, he exhaled onto one of her stiffened nipples before running the flat of his tongue over the pebbled nub. Sarah’s back arched at the sensation and Scorpio too the opportunity to wrap his hands around her back. Rolling her nipple around in his mouth and hearing Sarah’s shaky breaths, Scorpio was once again reminded of how small, fragile and sensitive she was. Ever flick of his tongue, suck of his lips and bite of his teeth had Sarah gasping and trembling and arching in his arms and Scorpio loved it. Paying the other nipple equal attention, Sarah was left feeling oddly pleasured at the wet feeling of Scorpio’s mouth alongside the rough rubbing of the mesh cups of the negligee. “Scorpio… I can’t… Take much… More…” Sarah let out breathy moans, softly pushing Scorpio’s shoulder further down her body. “Please… I want you to kiss me down there…” Seeing her so needy for the wonders of his tongue on her womanhood, Scorpio’s ego swelled. He chuckled low in his throat, an unintentionally animalistic sound, and he pushed her legs apart. Staring at her quivering lower lips through the material of her thong, Scorpio could see the wetness staining her underwear and he could smell the musky, sweetness of her arousal. He brought his face close to her mound and inhaled deeply.“You smell delicious.” Scorpio complimented, lighting an embarrassed fire in Sarah’s cheeks. Before Sarah had a chance to complain about the mortification she felt, Scorpio had shoved the soaked material to one side and had buried his face in her lower lips.Sarah moaned lewdly and Scorpio smirked, running his tongue over her glistening slit, collecting her juices on his tongue and tasting her. There was nothing he loved more than the taste of her womanhood, so sweet and utterly feminine. Groaning as he licked her, he reached around her thighs to place a hand on her soft, rippling lower stomach to steady her trembling. Angling his face in a certain way, when he pushed his tongue inside her, his nose roused her secret bundle of nerves from its hood. Her moans were uncontrollable and did nothing to quell Scorpio’s own growing arousal. “Sarah…” Scorpio moaned into her sex, sucking her lips into his mouth and sucking, nibbling ever so slightly on the soaking flesh. Sarah’s body was writhing now, coated in a thin layer of sweat, the straps of her lingerie slipping down her shoulders and the satin sticking to her body as her temperature rose drastically. “Scorpio, make me cum.” Sarah begged, running her hands down to twine into his dark hair. “Please make me cum… Please Scorpio… Scorpio…”Hearing her plea sent Scorpio over the edge. He tore the thong from her body, tossing the sopping scraps carelessly to the side and he held her lips apart, diving back in and attacking the bundle of nerves he knew would bring her the most pleasure. He rubbed the tip of his tongue savagely against it, in rough upwards motions followed by vigorous circles only to suck on it viciously. He didn’t stop his rough attack until he heard Sarah scream and felt liquid heat gush out of the entrance of her sex, staining his chin, and he looked up at her through his eyelashes to see her mouth gaping open, her body arching up off of the bed and her eyebrows furrowed in pleasure. When he breathing steadied and her trembling ceased, he detached his lips from her womanhood and tensed his jaw. He would do nothing unless Sarah asked it from him but the urge to grab his cock was overwhelming. He could feel it throbbing, begging him to release, to either thrust it into the warmth of Sarah’s mouth, the hot tightness of her pussy or for him to grab it himself and spend himself over Sarah’s body and face. But he did none of those things and instead, looked back down at the mess between her legs. The neatly shaved little heart of hair caught his eye and he smiled, kissing it softly.“You’re so wet, Sarah, I need to clean you up.” Scorpio groaned, pulling lightly at the soft little strands of hair with his teeth, making Sarah jolt. Brining his hand between her legs, Scorpio pushed a finger inside her, feeling her inner muscles grip his finger as he moved it slowly in and out of her. She began to thrust her hips, pushing against his hand, almost as if she desired to ride his fingers. From the sounds leaving both of her lips, Scorpio knew what she was craving, knew exactly what it was she wanted to desperately. But she hadn’t asked him for it yet, so instead he kept on doing what he was doing, pushing his fingers inside her tight heat and kissing the trembling muscles of her inner thighs. He slid another one of his fingers inside and curled them, searching for the spot that made Sarah see stars. Today was all about her, after all, and he was desperate to give her all the pleasure in the world. All of a sudden, a wave of thoughts hit him.Does he know how much I want him inside me? Sarah’s voice echoed in his head and he smirked, knowing that she often forgot about his power to read her mind. But his tongue… it feels so good… He dragged his tongue to flick over her wetness while his fingers searched for that place. If he keeps that up I’m going to cum again… Damn his fingers… Damn his tongue… That’s not what I want… I want him… I need him inside me… Oh shit! Scorpio hit that spot inside her and she screamed out, bucking her hips wildly against his hand, now desperate to feel more. Scorpio moved his fingers back and forth furiously over that spot inside her and Sarah’s entire body went limp with ecstasy. Scorpio… I know you can hear me… I can’t talk… All I can do is moan… Please… I can’t take it… Scorpio’s eyebrows rose as he heard Sarah talk to him from her mind. Sarah sat up, placing a hand on Scorpio’s head and pushing his face deeper into her hips. If you make me cum again will you give me what I want? I can see that you need me, Scorpio, please, oh god please… Don’t make me wish for it, do you really want the others to know what I’m craving? Scorpio simultaneously stroked her sweet spot and bit down harshly onto her clit and the words in his head transformed into a scream, so loud and so full of euphoria that Scorpio wasn’t sure whether Sarah’s screams were mental or vocal. Her insides clenched so tightly on his fingers that he struggled to pull them out of her.Though he wouldn’t admit it to her, he loved it when he made her feel good. He might be in the Department of Punishments, but making Sarah writhe and tremble and shudder and shake was something that Scorpio craved more than he craved self-satisfaction. He would lick and kiss and suck and bite at her womanhood, giving her orgasm after orgasm, for hours if she’d let him. But whenever he tried to make everything about her, she’d always complain about being oversensitive or complain about it not being fair that she got all the pleasure when ultimately, Scorpio didn’t care. Just to know she felt good, to know she got her release, that she was satisfied and just to hear her moan out his name as he pleasured her was enough for him.“Sarah?” Scorpio grunted softly as he removed his hand from between Sarah’s legs and moved back up her body. “Do you want me?” He asked quietly, trailing his fingertips so lightly over Sarah’s sides, sending shivers down her spine. Yes, Sarah’s voice echoed in his head, filled with lust and desire and affection. “How do you want me?” Scorpio pressed his lips to Sarah’s ear and tugged at the lobe with his teeth and relished the arching of her body up to his in response. “Do you want me to be gentle?” He licked the outer edge of her ear. “Sweet?” He kissed her ear. “Slow?” He blew on her damp ear and she moaned. “Or perhaps…” He kissed down her jaw and smiled when she trembled. “Do you want me to be rough?” She whimpered slightly as Scorpio growled in her ear. “Hard?” He reached down and finally touched his pulsing erection. “Fast?” He rubbed the tip against her wet folds, pulling back when Sarah tried to push her hips down so he would enter her. “How do you want me, Sarah?” He asked gently, looking down at Sarah and her flushed cheeks. She reached up and touched Scorpio’s face lightly. Staring deeply into his eyes, Sarah smiled as she thought of what she wanted Scorpio to do to her. Start off softly, Scorpio, I want to see you slowly lose control as you take me.Blushing in embarrassment, Scorpio pressed his lips softly to Sarah’s and smiled.“Anything for you, Sarah, since it’s your birthday and all.” He smirked and Sarah giggled a little. But her laugh was soon transformed into something else.“Aha-Haangh-Oh! Oh!” Sarah cried out as Scorpio finally pushed into her. Feeling her tightness wrapped around him, Scorpio felt a shudder down his spine. He had been with women before, goddesses and humans alike, but nothing came as close to the feeling of Sarah. Her hot, wetness and the tight feeling of her inner muscles quivering as he pushed deeper inside of her, it all made Scorpio crave her even more.“Sarah… Oh, Sarah…” He cried out, jaw tense and eyes intense as he forced her to stare into his eyes as he stilled inside her, just savouring the feeling of being inside of her.“Scorpio…” Sarah cried out, wrapping her arms around Scorpio’s back and clutching his back desperately. Scorpio groaned again, breathing into Sarah’s mouth and inhaling her breath as he moved slowly within her. “Feel me inside you, Sarah.” Scorpio chuckled darkly, every single sensation adding to his pleasure. Not only the delicious squeeze of Sarah’s womanhood, but the glide of the satin negligee against his stomach, the roughness of the mesh against his chest, the sharp drag of her nails down his back, the feeling of her ankles locking behind his hips as she encouraged his thrusts. “Feel my cock deep inside you; my breath on your skin; my hands on your body; my eyes on your face as I give you this ecstasy… I love making love to you, Sarah… Giving you this pleasure…” Licking down Sarah’s neck as she writhed underneath him. “You tighten when I talk to you, Sarah, does hearing me talk to you make you feel good?” He smiled, kissing her jaw and throat and earlobes.“Y-Yes… Scorpio… Yes…” Sarah trembled; the slow and teasing way Scorpio was moving caused tears to come to her eyes. More, Scorpio, give me more, love me more… She thought knowing for sure that he would be able to hear her. And hear her he did. And, doing whatever it took to give her the utmost pleasure.“Sarah… Sarah… Sarah…” Scorpio groaned, moving his hips against Sarah’s faster, trying to angle his hips to find, again, the spot that could make Sarah’s thoughts go blank. “You’re tightening around me…” Scorpio grunted again, moving harder and faster as Sarah’s thoughts urged him on. “Shit… Sarah…” Scorpio listened to the sounds of Sarah moaning, felt her nails scrape and scratch at his back and with every thrust, Scorpio felt a tightening in his ball sack that made him gasp. “Sarah… If you don’t stop gripping me like that I’m going to cum…” Scorpio shuddered again, now gasping as he lost control of his hips. Now thrusting wildly into her as the feeling in his manhood grew stronger. As the feelings overwhelmed him, he was determined to let Sarah feel amazing too and so brought a hand between them, vigorously pinching and rubbing her clit. “Scorpio, don’t… It’s too… Intense, I’m going to… Oh…!” And then the entire world fell away.Sarah’s back arched so dramatically that Scorpio had to pin her body down to control her intense shaking but while he had to control her intense convulsions, he also had to control his own as an orgasm unlike any he’d remembered having with anyone other than Sarah shook through his entire body. Loud shouts left his mouth while screams of pure ecstasy left Sarah’s. But no matter how uncontrollable the shaking of their bodies became, the contact of Scorpio’s eyes with Sarah’s couldn’t be broken as she felt his warm seed fill her and as he felt the warmth of her orgasm gush around him.Breathing heavily, they each waited for their spasms to subside. Only when he was certain he could move without either moaning or collapsing, he pulled out of her and rolled over, bringing her body over so she could rest on his chest.“Scorpio?” Sarah whispered, tracing her fingertips over his chest.“Yes?” Scorpio leant down and kissed the top of Sarah’s head, still covered with a light layer of sweat.“Perhaps, you could buy me some underwear more often?” Sarah gave an embarrassed smile as she traced her fingers over Scorpio’s chest. “It was… different… tonight.” She laughed softly against his skin and kissed his chest.“Yes, it was different.” Scorpio laughed and looked down at Sarah as she looked up at him. Scorpio glanced down and saw the lingerie he bought her sliding off of her body. “Because I was following your every instruction, whether you vocalised them or not.” He pressed a fingertip to her forehead, slid it down her nose, across her lips and then down her neck. “You do know the reason a man buys his girlfriend underwear as gifts right?” He slowly put the strap of her underwear back in place.“Other than wanting to see her in it?” Sarah chuckled, kissing Scorpio’s chest again.“The real reason a man buys his girlfriend lingerie,” Scorpio traced his finger down Sarah’s arm all the way down to her hips and toyed with the hem of the babydoll. “Is so that he can be the one to take it off.” He slipped his fingertips underneath the pink satin and Sarah hummed in contentment. “I haven’t had the pleasure of stripping you of your birthday gift yet.” He chuckled as he looked down at Sarah’s wide brown eyes.“And the real reason the girlfriend decides to wear it,” Sarah slid her hand down his torso and rolled over, straddling her boyfriend and toying with his nipples as she stared down at him, hair fluffed up and cheeks still flushed with a post-sex glow. “Is to see their boyfriend rip it off of them.” She leant down and pressed little kisses over his chest, nipping lightly with her teeth in order to leave her mark on his body. “To know that they desire them.” She licked the marks she’d made and felt a swelling sense of feminine pride as she felt Scorpio’s arousal grow again against her leg. Reaching between her legs, she gripped his cock in one hand and licked her lips. “Do you desire me, Scorpio?” “I always desire you, Sarah.” Scorpio reached up and took hold of her slender waist, running his thumbs over the satin of the babydoll. “And, I’m sorry about what I’m going to do to your birthday present, but…” He gripped the material and ripped it in two, throwing the torn material off, eyes feasting on her smooth olive skin. “I’ll make it up to you.” Sarah giggled, seeing the dilation of his pupils as he looked at her and she threw her head back in pleasure as she sank down onto his arousal, rocking her hips as Scorpio looked up at her in admiration.Laying back and watching the woman he loved ride him, Scorpio let his restrained groans and gasps and moans free. Putting himself inside the woman he loved was such an intimate act to Scorpio and seeing her gasping and twitching as she rode him, taking him so willingly inside of her, made Scorpio’s heart swell. That stupid fish might’ve been the one to talk Scorpio into buying the sexy negligee, but Scorpio, seeing what it caused to happen between him and his woman, knew that he would need to start making a tradition of buying Sarah sexy underwear. Even if he did just end up tearing it off of her.And there you have your first smut, @sarah-doodles, officially halfway through your giveaway prizes now! I’ll have your next headcanon - complete with gifs - ready as soon as possible, shortly followed by another fic and the final smut! Look forward to it :)

1st Place Winner
Prize 2 of 6 Fan-Fiction #1
I hope you liked the first headcanon @sarah-doodles, if you haven’t already seen it check it out here:OTBS - Inadvertently Turning Them OnAnd now here we have your first fan-fiction prize! You requested cute, blushy Takao Hirukawa when he mistakes you for being pregnant! Warning, much cuteness and fluffiness ahead! Enjoy!~Takuto Hirukawa - An Internet DiagnosisSat at the bar at LRN, Takuto squinted at the screen of his laptop, listening to the faint sounds of Sarah puking her guts up. Having avoided ‘holding hair back’ duty at all costs, Takuto decided to be somewhat helpful. “Are you sure that’s a good idea?” Riki frowned at Takuto’s screen, noticing what he was up to.“Better than going to an actual doctor’s office.” Takuto shrugged before turning his laptop away from Riki’s prying eyes. Looking at an online symptom checker, he was trying to think back to all things that could be a symptom of whatever was wrong with his normally upbeat and healthy girl. He input her gender and age, but left out the e-mail and contact information. Then he had to list the supposed symptoms. Thinking back, Takuto slowly added the symptoms as he remembered them.“Takuto, I think I need better bras, this one is getting too small and my boobs sore.”‘Swelling and tenderness of breasts’“I’m so tired, Taku. I don’t know why, I’m resting as normal, I’m just exhausted.”‘Fatigue’“Oh my god, what’s with me this past month, I need to pee like fifty times a day!”‘Increased urination’“U-Um, Takuto, these… these jeans… they don’t… don’t fit me anymore…”‘Weight gain’“Woah, I stood up way too fast, everything just went topsy-turvy…”‘Dizzy spells’“Bloody hell, Taku, turn that game down would you? My head is killing me!”‘Headaches’“I never knew that pickles on toast would taste this good!”‘Peculiar food cravings’What else?Takuto heard Sarah gag from the other room.‘Nausea and vomiting’Sighing, Takuto tapped his chin with a frown. Looking around as he thought, his eyes landed on the calendar hung up on the wall. Then his eyes landed on a red dot in the top right corner of one of the squares alerting the guys that Sarah was due to come on her period…Wait…He looked at the date of that square and counted. That was a week ago… But, she couldn’t have been on… not with what they did the night before…Hesitantly, Takuto added ‘Late Period’ to the list of symptoms and clicked the green ‘Diagnose’ button.Resting his chin in his palms, Takuto watched the circle in the middle of the screen go around for a few times before a list of possible problems came up. It was a very short list. So short, it only had one thing on it:Pregnant.Takuto sat and stared at the screen blankly for a few seconds waiting for another possibility to appear. When no other possibility arose, Takuto’s jaw dropped open slightly and his eyes went wide. P-Pregnant? It wasn’t possible. He had a box of condoms on his nightstand for this very reason… Pregnant? Sarah?“Takuto, you’ve gone seriously pale, what’s it say?” Kenshi asked with a concerned frown, wondering why Takuto’s face was running through a mixture of confused, panicked, and embarrassed expressions.“Sorry about that.” Sarah emerged from the bathroom with shaky knees and a pale face. Hearing her, Takuto slammed the lid of his laptop down and spun around to look at her, face flushed.“A-Are you… Feeling… Okay?” He stammered, eyes flicking from Sarah’s face to her round little tummy and back to her face again. How would his sweet little Sarah be able to carry around a baby in that body of hers? So tiny and petite… surely she’d break?“I’m fine,” Sarah gave her boyfriend a shaky smile and rested a hand on her stomach, regretting the shellfish she had eaten the night previous. Seafood never agreed with her in spite of how much she wanted it to. Takuto, seeing Sarah’s hand resting over her stomach, completely misunderstood the gesture. Standing up, Takuto walked over to her and held her face in his hands. Shocked at the tender action, Sarah stared up at him in shock. Looking at her wide eyes, the warm colour of mocha, Takuto envisions a baby with those adorable eyes of hers, his natural coloured hair atop its head and a fluffy Shiffey in its chubby little arms. The image gave him much more joy than he’d care to admit.“I love you, Sarah.” Takuto smiled sweetly, dropping his hands down to her waist and running his thumbs over her stomach softly. Soothed by his touch, Sarah smiled and closed her eyes, trying to steady her breathing and regain some strength in her knees. An overwhelming excitement bubbling in his chest at the supposed ‘knowledge’ that he was going to be a father, Takuto carefully lifted up her chin.“T-Taku?” Sarah blushed at his sudden intense gaze and he simply smiled at her, pressing his lips to hers in a brief, but warm and lingering kiss. “Taku, everyone’s watching.” Sarah glanced over at the guys, faces both shocked and mightily confused.“Is Takkun actually being sweet to Sarah?” Hiro commented in sheer shock, his eyebrows having risen drastically far up his forehead.“Boss, you better go check that the pork from Takuto’s noodles hasn’t flown off somewhere.” Riki chuckled slightly, his brows ever so slightly furrowed.“Has he been hypnotised again?” Kenshi murmured in concern.“Hypnotised by his love for Sarah by the looks of it!~” Atsumu laughed heartily, not appearing to be shocked at the sudden gentleness of Takuto’s actions. Takuto ignored them all. He was going to be a father; he had no time for those other guys.“Sarah.” Takuto pulled himself away from Sarah, holing her now by her shoulders, his tone of voice worryingly serious. “I love you.” He stared at her intensely and Sarah fidgeted uncomfortably.“You’ve said that already.” Sarah mumbled, unsure how to react to the sudden tense and serious atmosphere. The guys all frowned, watching this scene, uncertain as to what Takuto had up his sleeves.“I know.” Takuto smiled down at her sweetly and took her hands into his. “I don’t have a ring but…” And then Takuto got down onto one knee.“Holy…” Riki gasped.“What?!” Kenshi spat out his drink.“Oh my god…” Hiro swore.“U-Um…” Atsumu stuttered.“Sarah,” Takuto cleared his throat and looked up at his girlfriend lovingly. “Listen carefully, I’ll only say this once.” He looked at her pleadingly, smiling when he saw her beautiful mocha brown eyes swimming in tears. “I might tease you and call you every name under the sun, but even though I’ve been so horrible to you, you still love me and put up with me. I am so unbelievably grateful for everything you do for me. You’re such a beautiful human being, inside and out and I have no idea what I’d do if I’d never met you. I can’t live without you, I can’t survive without you, and I can’t even breathe without you. I never thought I’d be so dependent on another person, not least of all someone like you. You’re so good and kind and innocent, I’m still afraid that you’re too pure for me to touch. I feel like by being with me, I’m going to ruin everything that I love about you. But you’ve ruined me too. You have ruined me in all the best ways. To know this love and this devotion is something I never thought I deserved. I was so lonely as a kid, but now… You’ve taught me what love is like. You’ve shown me the wonders of loving another person and having that person love you back. You are everything good in the world. And I am everything bad. And yet here you are, stood before me with your hands in mine. You make every single one of my days worth living. We’ve stood by each other through so much in our time together and though not all of it’s been good,” Takuto shot a sidelong glare at Riki before gazing affectionately back up at Sarah, “we’ve managed to pull through: together. I can’t believe that you’ve put up with me for so long, and now I’m asking you to put up with me forever. I’m asking you to keep on showing me how amazing it is to be with someone; to love me and to let me love you for as long as we both live; to be with me forever and to start with me and to be my…” Takuto’s lower lip started to tremble and his voice cracked but he kept on going. “To be my family.”“Takuto…” Sarah was crying now, tears streaming down her cheeks and her face glowing with joy.“Sarah, will you marry me?” Takuto beamed.Heart hammering harder and harder against her ribcage, Sarah stared down at Takuto’s face: full of anticipation, nerves and heart-wrenching emotion. Tears gathered in his eyes as he awaited her answer. Sarah’s throat was dry and tight and she took a shuddering breath, gripping his hands tightly. Just looking at him in that moment had the same effect as the world simply crumbling down around them. The bar, the guys, their excited whispers and muffled sobs and sniffles, everything just faded away into the background. Only seeing him, Sarah knew that he would be all she could see for the rest of her life. Slowly moving her head, she nodded at him.“Y-yes…” Sarah cried. “Yes, Takuto, yes! I’d love to m-marry you!” Sarah cried harder and Takuto stood, grinning from ear to ear and wrapped his arms around her tightly, letting her cry her tears of joy into his chest. Laughing through his glee, Takuto stroked Sarah’s head, running his fingers through her soft auburn hair and pulled her head back. Looking down at her sweet, crying face, Takuto’s face relaxed before he brought his face close to hers and gently placed his lips against hers.Soft and sweet, his lips attached themselves to hers with the promise of never wanting to let her go. Running one hand down to her waist as she slid her hands up to rest against his chest, Takuto used his other hand to tilt her chin, opening her mouth wide, and he slowly eased his tongue into her mouth, twining with hers and sending tendrils of raw desire through his veins. It was only when Sarah’s breaths turned into small moans that he let her go, not wanting the guys to hear her panting, lustful gasps. Finally detached from each other, Takuto took her hands again and dragged her back to the bar and sat down, giving zero shits about the other guys as he pulled Sarah onto his lap, straddling him with her head under his chin.“Looks like my little baby Takkun’s all grown up.” Riki gave a sad sort of smile, extending his arm to slap Takuto on the back. “Congratulations, guys!” Kenshi bellowed, eyes red and puffy as he smiled at the two of them.“N’aww, but I wanted to marry Sarah!” Hiro pouted. Despite his words, he was clearly over the moon at having witnessed Takuto’s proposal.“Drinks are on me!” Atsumu laughed again, passing around the bottles of beer to everyone.Takuto’s heart stopped when he saw Sarah reach for a bottle with a smile.“No!” He smacked the bottle out of her hands and sent it crashing to the ground, luckily the glass didn’t smash but the beer was gushing out onto the floor. Everyone stared at him in shock.“Why can’t I have a drink?” Sarah asked him, more curious than mad. Takuto looked at her in bewilderment. “B-because…” Takuto blushed and dropped his hands and slid his hands up her shirt gently, hands gentling caressing the soft flesh of her tummy. “Because we’re having a baby.”“WHAT?!” The group did a collective spit-take. Sarah’s eyes widened in shock and she stared at Takuto like he was slightly mad.“A… baby?” She repeated, incredulous.“Yeah, I looked up all your symptoms. It’s the only explanation!” Takuto smiled widely, looking at his girlfri- his fiancée’s disbelieving expression. She didn’t know, he realised. He pondered what a strange situation this was: wasn’t it normally the girl telling the guy she was pregnant as opposed to the guy telling her?“Um, Takuto…” Sarah’s heart sunk in her chest seeing how excited he was about the prospect of them having a baby together. Fidgeting in his lap, Takuto didn’t catch her depressed expression.“We’re going to be parents, Sarah,” Takuto giggled, actually giggled, in excitement and kissed Sarah’s forehead. “I’ve made you a mother and you’ve made me a father.” He kissed her again. “My baby is in your tummy right now, Sarah, isn’t that exciting?” He stared at her with such a childish, giddy expression that made Sarah’s heart tear in two.“Takuto…” Sarah took his head into her hands and looked at him. “I’m not pregnant.”Takuto’s heart stopped in his chest.“What?” Takuto faltered.“I’m… I’m not… We’re not…” Sarah looked down, feeling oddly ashamed of not being pregnant.“But… But the morning sickness and, and, and you’re tired all the time and… and you need to pee all the god damn time and, and… a-and… the weird food and, and… the dizziness and… and your body… y-your jeans don’t fit and… and your boobs are sore and swelling!” Takuto pleaded, desperate for the image of his child not to be torn from him. Sarah blushed as she heard Takuto’s distraught voice listing all the ‘symptoms’.“I was sick because of the shellfish I ate, yesterday Taku.” Sarah explained softly, cradling Takuto’s head as he stared at her, miserable. “I’m probably tired because of work and I pee a lot because I drink a lot and I have odd taste in food and I really do stand up too quickly and my jeans shrunk in the wash and boobs get sore sometimes, it’s not… it isn’t necessarily about being pregnant.” Sarah sighed. She hated seeing the expression of joy on Takuto’s face turn into the one he was wearing now – a look of pure devastation.“But… you’re late…” Takuto made one last attempt at stopping his dreams from flying away.“I’m on the pill.” Sarah confessed, looking away from Takuto. She never thought she’d feel so badly for not being pregnant, she even felt guilty for not telling him about her going on the pill.“O-Oh…” Takuto bit into his lip, trying to stop the ache in his heart. It had only been for thirty precious minutes, his dreams of fatherhood, but those thirty minutes had been the best of his life. The idea of getting his girlfri- fiancée pregnant had been exhilaration and, admittedly, ever so slightly arousing knowing that his sperm had quickened within her. Takuto’s eyes widened. Sarah was his fiancée now. He had proposed to her. Sarah seemed to come to the same conclusion as he did and looked at him with such a hurtful expression that Takuto unconsciously held on tighter to her body.“Did you… You only proposed to me because you thought I was pregnant, didn’t you?” Sarah tensed her jaw as she felt tears form in the corner of her eyes, vision becoming blurred.“I… I…” Takuto fumbled for a response, an attempt of denial, but he came up empty.“So…” Kenshi interrupted the serious moment with a question. “You aren’t pregnant, Sarah?” He asked. Sarah shook her head. “They aren’t getting married either from the looks of things either.” Riki sighed, suddenly disappointed.“We are getting married!” Takuto snapped at him, eyes burning with fury. “I love her and she loves me and, pregnant or not, she’s mine and I’m hers and that’s that!” Takuto yelled but then he froze and looked at Sarah helplessly. “If you still want to, of course.” He coughed, blushing. Sarah’s tears had stopped and she smiled softly now.“Of course I still want to marry you, Takuto.” She pressed a kiss to the skin between his eyebrows. “I’m in love with you.” Sarah stated, a slight blush in her cheeks as she smiled at Takuto sweetly. “Were you really that happy when you thought I was pregnant?” Sarah asked, placed her hands on Takuto’s neck and placed her thumbs on the junction of jaw and neck. She could feel the heat radiation from his skin as his blush deepened.“No.” Takuto sulked stubbornly and Sarah giggled and brought her face close to his and rubbed her nose against his.“Shame,” Sarah let her breath wash over Takuto’s slightly parted lips, her voice a low and sultry whisper. “I was going to stop taking the pills, throw away your condoms and start making babies with you.” Sarah looked at Takuto through her eyelashes, his face turning so red that Sarah was surprised his head hadn’t exploded.“Y-you mean… I can… Inside you?” Takuto frowned a little, looking down at Sarah’s hips uncertainly, a different kind of excitement bubbling inside him. Sarah smiled and brought her lips to his ear, ensuring only he could hear her next words.“You can fill me up until I’m overflowing, Taku.” She bit his earlobe and his entire body jolted as if he’d been struck by lightning. “Maybe next time your internet diagnosis might be correct?” She teased kissing his neck softly.“Next time it will definitely be correct.” Takuto whispered, smiled and sent a prideful smirk at the guys as they watched he and Sarah whisper things to each other and watched her slowly plant kisses and soft nibbles at his neck. Closing his eyes as the feeling of his fiancée’s lips washed over him, he wasn’t certain that the weight of everything that had happened in the past hour had fully hit him yet. In the space of sixty minutes he had been a father-to-be, and then he had proposed, got engaged, then suddenly wasn’t a father-to-be and now he was still engaged and was planning to get his fiancée pregnant. A lot of emotions had run through his veins in the past hour and Takuto was left feeling secure, excited, loved and was now certain that he should never perform an internet diagnosis again… or he should at least wait to be told that Sarah was pregnant by either Sarah herself or a doctor before doing anything drastic like proposing. Well, Takuto thought as he bit his lip trying to keep from letting out a low groan, all’s well that ends well.I don’t think I’ve ever fangirled over something I myself have written but when imagining the little adorkable tsun-tsun proposing to you when he thinks you’re pregnant was so cute! I hope you liked this @sarah-doodles and I’ll try and post your next prize tomorrow! :D
