Honestly I will always be grateful to Brooklyn 99 for giving us “cool motive, still murder” as a quick, no-frills response to all these weak white boy villains with woe-is-me backstories that fandoms inevitably try to woobify.

"It was when I was 12 and I got cast in The Hunger Games, and people called me the N-word and said that the death of my character, Rue, would be less sad because I was black. That was the first moment I realized being black was such a crucial part of my identity in terms of the way that I was perceived and how it would affect any line of work that I wanted to pursue. I often find myself in situations where I am the token black person. It can feel like this enormous weight. I have definitely had moments when my hair felt too big or like I needed to make myself smaller and easier to digest."
— Amandla Stenberg (“So when was the moment that you realized exactly what you were taking on just by existing in this space?”)(Source: hgdailynews, via tatianasemmy)

Do you know who doesn’t get enough love from the Harry Potter fandom?Madam Poppy BAMF PoppyEscorted a teenage werewolf to a deadly tree each month.Took care of that teenage werewolf after every full moon and you know that she probably fussed over him and mothered him and gave him a bunch of chocolate.Literally didn’t question things.This boy has a bite that’s turning green and he says is from a dog? Okay.This girl is half-cat? AlrightHad to put up with Harry’s excessive injuries each year.Took care of and cured a bunch of petrified students.Didn’t put up with Malfoy’s crap.LITERALLY YELLED AT DUMBLEDORE!YELLED AT THE MINISTER OF MAGIC!KICKED DUMBLEDORE AND THE MINISTER OF MAGIC OUT!!!Was the one who took care of Cedric Diggory’s corpse.Refused to resign under Umbridge’s regime because she was afraid of what would happen to the students.Took care of everyone during the battle in HBP.Fought in the Battle of Hogwarts and tended to the wounded/dead.Probably had to deal with hundreds of students who misused the Engorgio Charm.Madam Pomfrey deserves your love and respect.

If I ever offend you or your culture
islndquxxn:
Politely have a conversation with me about it.
Educate me.
I know my struggles I would never intentionally disrespect yours.
I love to know the history behind words and culture that I never knew before, it never has to be an offensive conversation that gets neither of us no where.
We are all ignorant to something, but it doesn’t have to start a war.
