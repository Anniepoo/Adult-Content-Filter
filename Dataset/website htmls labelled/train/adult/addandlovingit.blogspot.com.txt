-BACK FROM THE ATL-
Well hi I am back. Went to the ATL for about 6 days. It was fun. It was good to see old friends again. I went for a wedding, and how about the groom whom I have know just as long as the bride has did not know who I was, and did not bother asking until after the wedding. So I get this voicemail from the bride that says hi Nicole I know you did not expect to hear from me this soon but Germain made me call you cause he did not know who you were yesterday and wanted to say hello. I tell you the man is crazy. I cut my hair and he does not know who I am? I still look the same, have since the like third grade. Only thing that has changed is I don't have braces and my hair changes month to month. Oh yeah and I am a little bit taller. (not much) Nothing really exciting happened no drama or nothing so I have no fun stories to tell you. However I did come back 3 tats (should have been 4 but the BF's took a day and a half) and a few clogged arteries richer. We did get a pretty nice rental car for the price we paid. That was the little bit of excitement that we had. I also got to meet my friend that I have been talking to on IM for about 8 years now. So that was cool too. Other than that same old same old. Oooh one more thing I went to the new aquarium and it was SO cool. I love water so I was in heaven. It was almost like scuba diving without getting wet. Well until next time later gators

-Goals Suck!-
Ok so I have come to the conclusion that setting goals in my life just does not work. Every time I set a goal it does not happen. I am better off not setting them and letting things happen natural. That is why I do not do the New Years resolution thing. Let me give you an example.... A few months ago I did a post that I was on a mission to loose a few lbs. Yeah how about that did not happen. How about I was doing really well and then because I was not eating like I usually eat I got sick. So I started eating again and gained another 2lbs instead of loosing it. Another example I said my entire life that I wanted to be married with kids by the age of 25. I also said when I had a kid I was no longer working. Well we see how well that ish worked out for me. At 25 I was not married and had no kids still in school not doing much of anything. How about I had a kid at 28 not married and guess what I come to work every frikin day. So as you can see goals in my life don't work. Now every time I don't set a goal good things happen. If I don't say I need to loose weight I just loose it. If I could just learn to keep my mouth shut things would be great. So from now on no frikin goals for me I am just going to live life and let god do the rest. Now watch now that I said that I am going to have real bad luck. Well until next time later gator....

-She's Back-
Yes I know I have been MIA for about a month now but it is not me that I am talking about. I am talking about the very large lady who goes to see the psychologist across the all. Today she waddles her big self into my office huffin and puffin lookin around for something, I guess candy then she is like can I borrow a pen. I said sure so I I gave her a pen. She said I will give it back to you when I am done. So she sits her big ass in our waiting room (there is one across the hall) and starts looking at the pen like it is a foreign object. WTF have you never seen a pen before? DO you think if you look at it long and hard enough it will suddenly be filled with candy? I don't get it. She did not even use the pen she just looked at it. I go back into my office and come out 20 minutes later and she is still sitting there with a big ass grin on her face. I just look at her like why are you still here. If you don't see candy there ain't gona be none, now move ya ass to across the hall. Finally she went across the hall. I now see why she visits the psychologist. 3 hours later she came back with the pen. I am scared to touch it.So yes I have been gone for a while. I have been a busy beaver. I am trying to buy a house but the owner is being a prick and making it very difficult so now I am back on the hunt and hope to find one. Wish me luck. Oh yes the devil child is gone so that puts my stress level down about 5 notches. Except get this about 2 days after he is gone his dad calls me and says his mom is being shipped to Iraq. Ok that is not cool I am sorry that she is has to go there and be in a pretty dangerous situation but lord please if that child is coming back here to live will you please ship me to Iraq I can't do it. Good news he is staying with his grandparents. Thank you Jesus. Ok don't think I have much else to say. Hope you all are doing well until next time later gator.......

-Somebody please remove me from this madness-
Lord oh Lord I need a vacation. So this week was very interesting. I tell you at this point I wish I did have a dull moment in my life because it seams like excitement never stops around my life and it is not excitement like yes I won a million dollars, it is more of the I am going to kick a mother fuckers ass excitement. However seeing that I am as big a 4th grader I am thinking I am not going to kick a mother fuckers anything. Any who on Tuesday I am sitting at my desk working and all of the sudden the cops walk in and ask me if I know the kid on the ID. Of course I did it was my eldest child of the ship I am running. I dropped him off at the YMCA that morning how about the police arrested him for attempted theft. He says he did not do and he explained the situation to me, and I am sorry to say because of where it occurred I have to believe they were hating on the black man because the refused to question anybody else. So that was my Tuesday. Wednesday went ok no major drama. Well then came Thursday everything was going great until I picked up Alexi from camp. How about this child got suspended form camp because he was hitting people not just on Thursday but on Wednesday too. He was not only hitting but talking out of turn and disrespecting people. That pissed me right off so I took him home to his Daddy to get an ass wooping. His birthday is Tuesday and I am thinking he does not want shit for his birthday but a bag of cole. He will be lucky if he gets that much. Then I take my oldest to school he comes back everything is all good and we look at the cell phone bill. How about this fool ran the cell phone bill up to $422. WTF you don't ever leave the house why the hell do you need to talk on the cell phone for 2280 minutes I mean seriously. I don't talk that much and I am never at home. Time and time and time again we tell him get off the cell phone use the house phone. I am thinking this time he will listen. Because he has no job he now has to sell all his gaming stuff to pay the bill. Welcome to the life of adulthood my friend. You don't get to sport the latest clothes and have the latest electronics when you have no job an bills to pay. Oh the Joys of learning to grow up. Guess he will have a pre paid phone from now on and when the minutes are gone he is just SOL.So really calgon take me away please oh please before somebody dies in my house.Oh yes and my little lady, she is being the typical two and had gotten popped a few times this week. So If I crawl in a hole and hide do you think people will wonder where I went? Well until next time Later Gator!

-Intoxication fest-
Yes it is that time again in the Mil where people stay intoxicated for 9 days. It is Summer Fest time. Even though I would love to party for 9 days I happen to have a job and kids to look after so I can't do that. However I am doing that tonight. My old self is kickin it. As always we are rollin deep and picking up a few on the way by the end of the night I will have so many friends I won't know what to do with them all. In the morning I may not like the fact that I got decided to act young again, but oh well I think I will survive.I AM BACK FROM THE AZWell I am back I went to AZ for 4 days to visit a friend I had not seen in 11 years. It was great fun and I can't wait to go back next year in September. I don't think I will go to the AZ in June ever again. Can you say holy hot! I mean we got off the plane at 6:00pm and it was still 112 degrees outside. We drove 2 hours to Flagstaff in the Mts and how about it was still in the 80's by the time we got there. Because it is not normally this hot my friend does not have central air so it was a bit hot in the house too. The nights were cool got down to the low 50's. However my mom queen of all miss prisses would not stop bitching. This women bitched about something the entire time we were there. We had no drama while I was there other than me wanting to kill my mother, her upityness gets all over my nerves and 4 days with my mom is 3 days to long. So I will be going back next September with out her. I got to see some cool stuff like the grand canyon. While we were there there were lots of fires because it is soooo dry and it had not rained in a looooong time. (see picture above) We did a little shopping got the person taking care of Alexi some gifts and got my kid some shoes other wise we did the tourist thing. I wish I could have stayed longer but I had to get back to work. So here I am back to work with not a dam thing to do gotta love it. Well later gators

-Holy Clean-
Well My third kid came on Tuesday and so far so good. He helps with the kids and that is great. I got home from work yesterday and OMG I have never seen my house so clean. I could see my counter tops there were not piles of mail all over them. I could see my carpet there were not toys every where you looked. He even cleaned off the washer and dryer and tidied up the laundry room. I was totally floored so floored that I almost had to take pictures of the place and send them to people. I even got on the phone to the BF (he has been gone about 3 weeks and not back until the first of the month) to tell him how clean the house was. My room on the other hand well yea that is still a reck and I have clean clothes all over the place. Guess I have a few hour project this Weekend. My cleaner has already started straightening up his and the little mans room. My friends were like he needs to come to my house. Hell you pull out the cash and I sure he will come a cleaning. As I type he is cleaning out one of my friends basements. What a kid what a kid. Now all I have to do is get him educated and a job and we are good to go. I wish I knew of some other teenagers or 18-20 year olds that he could kick it with. I am sure being in the house is going to drive him nuts. I have not told him yet but one of the clubs has underage night. I would let him go but he has nobody to go with. Not to mention he is a little girl crazy and I am not going to put him in an environment where he could get in trouble with out the BF being around. He fears him. He respects me but fears him. Well I must get some work done I guess so later gator.Oh yea I have decided not to post very often because one I can't spell and two I don't have much to say I guess.

-On A Mission-
So I have decided that I am on a mission. Now that the man is gone and I am going to be in charge of 3 kids alone I thought other than go crazy I would be on a mission to do something for my self. My Mission is to 1. Loose 10-15 lbs and 2. Clean out my house. Ok no I am not over weight however I am 10-15 lbs heaver than I would like to be and I don't fit into my cute clothes anymore that is really very upsetting. It is summer I am suppose to be able to strut my stuff. It is only warm enough 3 months out of the year to do so. Now when you comment lovely friends of mine don't go hating on me. If I don't like my self nobody else will like me right? Once my 3rd kid gets here next week I can go to the gym early in the morning because he can stay home with he kids. I have been slacking lately on the gym thing. So in order to do this I am looking for a weight watchers book so if anybody has one please let me know. I am cheap I am not going to go and buy one just to loose 10-15 lbs. I would rather spend that money on a drink or two or three at the end of the week when I want to murder all three or at least 1 of my lovely children. Mission number 2 Clean out my house. I have so much crap in my house that I never use not to mention clothing that does not fit or I do not wear so I am starting to toss out and sell. I am intending to get a house hopefully with in the next year and I want to take as little trash with me as possible. I have already cleaned out under he bathroom sink and one of the book shelves that miscellaneous stuff tends to float too. Oh yea I also cleaned out the kids closet to make room for the new kid. My next mission is the storage closet that is going to be scary. It is piled floor to ceiling full of crap. So wish me luck I am going to be a new women when the man returns I have until Midnight on July 1st. Not to all of those who knew me before I had a baby I am not going to be that skinny ever again that was a little too skinny. Well until next time......Later gator.
