David Bowie: “Why are there practically no blacks on the network?”
Mark Goodman: “We seem to be doing music that fits into what we want to play on MTV. The company is thinking in terms of narrowcasting.”
David Bowie: “There seem to be a lot of black artists making very good videos that I’m surprised aren’t being used on MTV.”
Mark Goodman: “We have to try and do what we think not only New York and Los Angeles will appreciate, but also Poughkeepsie or the Midwest. Pick some town in the Midwest which would be scared to death by… a string of other black faces, or black music. We have to play music we think an entire country is going to like, and certainly we’re a rock and roll station.”
David Bowie: “Don’t you think it’s a frightening predicament to be in?”
Mark Goodman:“Yeah, but no less so here than in radio.”
David Bowie: “Don’t say, ‘Well, it’s not me, it’s them.’ Is it not possible it should be a conviction of the station and of the radio stations to be fair… to make the media more integrated?”

I will always be the virgin-prostitute, the perverse angel, the two-faced sinister and saintly woman.

My name is Aaliyah and you probably already know what I'm about if you're following me on here?:)
Plz reblog my pics if you like them!
I only ask that you keep the watermark on them(do not crop or alter them in any way) so everyone knows where the good smut cums from;)
Reblogging my pics with the watermarks/links back to my website is HELPING me.Removing either of these is considered to be stealing and you will be HURTING me. Just remember that plz;)
