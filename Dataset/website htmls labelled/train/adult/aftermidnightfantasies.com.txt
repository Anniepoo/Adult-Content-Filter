WELCOME!
Thanks for stopping by — I am so glad you did! First, let me say how much I appreciate hearing from you all. It makes my writing so much fun, knowing you are waiting for my next book.
Great news!
THE GREAT AWFUL is finished and is available in Print and Digital formats. Check the BOOKS page of my website for a short synopsis of the story, plus Buyer Links. Happy reading!
What’s next??
BIJOUX MAJIK, an urban fantasy/paranormal is in the publishing pipeline. It should — once again barring life’s little challenges — be available early 2015. Keep an eye on the website for that availability date. And check the BOOKS page for expanded information on the story threads.
SURVIVORS’ DREAMS — my science fiction/fantasy novel — has been received with great enthusiasm and I am working on the sequel.
Actually, I am working on sequels to all three books so keep an eye on my UPCOMING page for updates!
Thanks again for all the comments and input, for following me on Twitter and Facebook. You are very much appreciated!
Thanks for visiting!
