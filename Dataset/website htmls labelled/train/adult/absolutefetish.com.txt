TMI Tuesday
1. If your lover was turned on by forced feminization would you participate (giving or receiving)?
*forced feminization is the practice of enforcing activities on a male, which are typically associated with women, to make him submissive. For example: wearing lingerie, heels, make-up.
Yep. Yep. Yep yep yep. I would do this in a red-hot second and I would enjoy it thoroughly. It would probably become a thing.
2. When you have sexual dreams or fantasies that are aggressive or cruel, does it worry you?
No. I fully embrace the darker side of my fantasies and dreams and think of them as a healthy outlet. I actually let myself have these fantasies ( not for real ) without feeling guilty, too.
3. Tell us your hottest filthiest fantasy, right now, in 100 words or less.
This is the fantasy about your desires that you probably never share, maybe they even go against your morals, or are societal taboos.
Getting shoved over by a zombie and, instead of it eating me it pins me down and force-fucks me raw with its weird nasty-ass rotting cock. It might be one, it might be more than one, but they'd all come in me and leave me a mess of rotted flesh and cum. ( I don't need logic in my fantasies, zombies can have boners! )
4. Which super hero would you like to have sex with? Why?
a. Aquaman - Because he probably doesn't get much if any action, and he's gotta fantasize a ton. I bet he'd be DAMN good at the sex. I mean really. He's an from an advanced society... I bet they figured out how to make dicks huge.
b. Superman
c. Wonder Woman
d. She-Ra
5. Knowing there’s a hot young couple in the adjoining hotel room, would you press your ear against the wall to hear the action on the other side?
DEFINITELY. I would probably record the sounds, to be honest...
6. Do you think the lure to live out sexual fantasies or have sex frequently is amplified by technology? Briefly explain.
Sort of. I think it's easier to have access or exposure to sexual fantasies ( fetishes/kinks/etc ) as well as frequent sexual acts, so it makes it more acceptable in general to do these things. I don't think it's a bad thing, however.
Bonus: Describe your fantasy life in three (3) words.
Motherfucking wickednasty business. ( That's 3 words, really! )

A snake? More like a billy club...
But that's really not a bad thing. I like billy-clubs; they're kinda kinky and ( at least in this case ) can be used as a sextoy. Sweet!
Anyway, when I got the Anaconda the packaging was... well, gloriously see-through and very blunt. There's no way you're going to get away with thinking this is anything but a dildo with a handle. Just.. none.
At least you'll also know it's silicone. 100% platinum silicone, even. Anyway, you can definitely keep the Anaconda in this, but the packaging is also somewhat inefficient, space-wise. You can actually store this dildo sitting upright, however, because the base is flat on the bottom. It's not too stable, so if you do go that way, you'll want to put it somewhere where it doesn't run the risk of falling onto toys ( or other things ) of different materials.
Once you take it out of the package, you're presented with 12 inches of silidick, from tip to handle. The widest point is 2 inches at the ridge of the head, which then tapers down into 1.5 inches on the main part of the shaft. The insertable part of this dildo is 7.75 inches long - the handle itself is 4.25 inches. I got mine in purple - it's actually a very rich color, though it doesn't have the pearly swirls the fuchsia does.
The handle is one of  my favorite things about this dildo, honestly. Lots of dildos just have really huge bases that are awful to hold onto, especially if you have smaller hands, but this thing has a handle. A HANDLE. Why don't more dildos come with variations that have this? Seriously. The handle on this makes it way easier to manipulate in a number of positions, to be honest. I've always had issues with reaching dildos if I'm masturbating doggy-style but the handle really helps me out in this position. And... pretty much every other position out there, really. It's also got some really bitchin' ridges that fit between my fingers so that's a bonus. It's also got the same texture going on that the shaft does - a very matte grip, which helps with keeping hold to the handle if there's lube all over.
The texture of this thing is... rough. Kind of really rough. I've never had problems with surface-texture before, but this is really pushing it for me. I have to use a LOT of lube to compensate for it, and if I don't, it's got a tendency to become unpleasant. I'm not going to say 'it rubs me raw', because it doesn't - not quite - but for people who are more sensitive to surface textures than me, it could be more problematic than the simple solution of re-applying lube whenever things get too rough.
The Anaconda I received actually has a small defect on it - there's a weird smooth patch on the shaft ( it looks like an elephant ) that I'm pretty sure shouldn't be there. It doesn't bother me any, but keep in mind that it's a thing that can happen if you get one with a patch like that.
Other than that, this feels great. Vaginally, it's very filling - the silicone extremely hefty and, because of the firmness and weight to it, I can actually feel the girth on this thing. I've had issues where dildos with the same 2-inch width won't feel like two inches because they're too flexible and they compress, but this one, not so much. That being said, it's not for people who don't like girthy dildos. The details on it also feel really nice - the raised glans and the wrinkles behind the head  are pronounced enough that they give some rather decent stimulation to my g-spot when I'm thrusting, even without angling it to do so.
The length on this ( including the handle ) is also pretty great. I can give myself an excellent reaming without having to worry about it falling out because of re-adjusting, for the most part - it also means I can go for deeper penetration because it's so long. However, because of the length, if you're using it with a partner you'll need to have good communication with them so they don't accidentally push your limits to the point of pain. It's easy to overshoot with this and it does have the potential to get uncomfortable.
The Anaconda is also hella detailed. The head, like I mentioned earlier, has wrinkles and folds behind it. The shaft also has some veins on it - not overly-accented, but enough to be a nice added touch. There's also a ridge going down the underside of the shaft which is, personally, one of my favorite parts of the penis, so I'm really glad they threw that on in there.
Since it's silicone, you can use this to dabble around in temperature-play; just pop it in the freezer or put it in a tub of warm water and you'll have your own hot/cold dildo to play with. You can also use this in the shower/tub/whatever else because it's pure silicone and water won't effect the functionality, any.
You can probably use this anally and still be safe, too. Because of the length and the handle, it would be hard to get this lost in your butt, but some people might not feel comfortable using it because the flare on the base might not be enough to stop it from getting completely lost. It's a judgement call.
Now, let's get down to the cleaning business. Being silicone, this is going to collect fuzzies. LOTS of fuzzies. The matte texture of... well, most of it, will help prevent too much from clinging ( though some still does ), but on the head and the flat underside of the base are still problem areas. I've found smoother toys collect more lint and etc. than rougher toys do.
Because of the fuzzies, you'll probably want to be cleaning this frequently. You can do so by boiling it, using toy-wipes or spray on it, by tossing it into the dishwasher for a rinse cycle ( on the top rack, of course ) or even by using the good old soap-and-water routine.
Don't use silicone- or oil-based lubes with this; they can degrade the toy's materials and make it melt or get really icky and unusable. Water-based is the way to go for this toy ( and for every other silicone toy out there ). Keep in mind that you also won't want to store this touching other toys - that can have the same effect that lube can - a melted dick. Opt for a toy-bag or just store it on its own, but don't mix materials.
Bonus round! This thing packs a real heft behind it. If you wanted to whack someone with it, you could really inflict some pain, bruising, etc., which is another reason why I refer to it as 'the billy club'. It's great for smacking intruders and would make some pretty hilarious headlines; "Burglar bludgeoned by baseball-bat dildo!". You could also probably use this as a spanking tool - since it's so weighty, it deals a good smack, but that also means it would be easy to seriously injure someone with it if you were using it to paddle someone with.
Over-all, I give the Anaconda 5/5 stars. It's just awesome - a real badass toy and I'd definitely recommend buying it.

Ride a Rocket to the moon
I'm quite fond of the Trojan Midnight Collection. The first vibe I got from that line was great - the Trojan Interchangeable - so I snagged the Trojan Compact Rocket Vibrator one from GoodVibes because I'm of the opinion that one can't have enough good, classy clit vibes.
And I was completely right. The Trojan Rocket Vibrator came to me in some very swanky purple packaging - though it's not very discrete. I'm pretty sure everyone and their grandmother, dog and second-cousin-twice-removed knows what the Trojan brand-name stands for.
As you can see it's definitely not discrete, especially since you can see what's in the packaging - a vibrator. It's also probably going to be really obvious as to what it is even if you store it without the packaging - which you can use store it in there if you want, but it actually comes with a much better option. The Rocket comes with this really nice satiny toy-bag in black which gives you a really nice place to put it when you're not using it. It's also a lint-free bag, so you won't have to worry about fuzzies getting on your new vibe.
The Rocket is, like the others in its series, really, really nice. The main plastic of the body is coated in something that makes it easier to grip ( even if you've got lube on your hands ), while the portion that comes in contact with your clit is coated in silicone. The two different halves can screw apart to reveal the battery compartment - as well as an O-ring to keep the water out - and the whole thing only takes one battery which is another plus. The entire device is 5 inches long, and the widest point is at the tip at 1 inch across. The power-button end is 0.5 inches wide.
The controls are surprisingly nice too, even though there's only one button. You use it to cycle through all the different vibration patterns and strengths, and if you want to turn it off without clicking through every function it offers, you hold it down for a couple seconds and it shuts off without any hassle - which is a huge convenience. I'm glad they included this, because they didn't on the Interchangeable and it was just frustrating. The button doesn't give much resistance to pushing, either, and I've found that it's not in much of a place to get accidentally pushed or switched off.
The vibrations themselves consist of three different intensities and three different vibration patterns:
1: Low speed
2: Medium
3: High
4: A slow graduation from low to high before it resets back to low. Takes about 1.5 seconds.
5:  A short burst of High vibrations - between each pulse, there's no vibrating.
6: 4 bursts of medium followed by a 1.5 second pulse of high.
I find, as usual, that the high is pretty much the only one that can actually cause me to climax, while all the other speeds or patterns are really great for bringing myself close to coming or just outright teasing myself. The strength of the vibes is about 2 out of 5 on the lowest setting and it maxes out around a high 3 out of 5 on the most powerful setting. It's not quite enough to warrant a score of 4, but it's close.
The vibrations are also focused right at the tip of the Rocket - meaning that it's strongest right where you need it, and not where you don't ( plus, I haven't had much issue with my hand going numb when I use this ). The silicone of the tip also offers some pretty decent friction, so if you like to rub your clit with vibrators, this will probably afford you some really nice sensations. I found that I do have to use a little lube to get it moving smoothly without dragging too much, however. It's also got ridges which I find are really nice for rubbing over my clit - it adds some extra 'oomph' to the whole thing which can make up for the score of 3/5 on the vibrations.
Lube-wise, you should only use water-based, since silicone- or oil-based lubes can cause this toy to degrade. To clean it, you can actually pop it under the water without worrying since the O-ring keeps the water out. Just use some soap and warm water, if you want, or toy spray, or even wipes to sanitize the Rocket. Please, don't go boiling this because you'll ruin it! It's a vibrator ( not to mention it's got plastic parts ) and those should never be boiled or sent through the dish-washer because it can fuck with the internal workings.
In total, I'm giving this a 4 out of 5. Thanks, GoodVibes!
