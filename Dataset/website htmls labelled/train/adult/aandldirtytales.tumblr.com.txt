Anonymous asked:hi~ sorry if you've answered this question before but what pairing is your fic 'sadistic intentions' going to end with or have most of?
Hey there, stranger o/
Nope, we didn’t, actually it’s the first time anyone asked us abt the pairings of this particular fic xD
So, It’s not going to end with any pairing per say, and it’s to be somewhat balanced between Jongtae and 2min,
the difference is that Jongtae’s relationship is based on sex (more like a continue abuse), while 2min will share deeper feelings.
Although if you really must have an answer to that question, I believe it does have a slight pull to Jongtae, meaning they have a couple  more scenes than 2min, along the fic.
Hope this answers your question =D
Anything else, just ask us u.u

(…) Taemin stopped midair, his light green wings moving only enough to keep him still. He saw one, then two, then three of the creatures approach and surround him.
He waited until the creatures felt confident enough to come closer and, when one of them was about to pounce, he stopped moving and allowed his body to drop freefall, luring the creatures for a precious minute in which he flew back in the same direction he came from.
Taemin flew dangerously close to the waterfall’s mountain, reaching its top and flying ahead, to the forbidden land. He thought the creatures wouldn’t follow him there, but one of them did, reaching Taemin and not yanking his arm by a whisker.
The fairy was able to deviate his body, but his left wing hit a stone of the rocky mountain and folded. Since he wasn’t able to fully open his wing, he fell quickly and his body shocked itself against the ground. Taemin still was able to open his eyes for a second, but quickly closed them as he lost his senses.

In a peaceful land, the wolves of the east and the south were the only ones that remained as rivals.
After a lot of consideration, the leaders of the packs decided they would unite their lands through the marriage of their sons; Tao, from the south and Minhyun, from the East.
Both the young men agreed with that marriage, but when he reached the south land another wolf stole Minhyun’s heart; a wolf that would take his breath away and make him wonder if being a leader was the real desire of his heart.
