Hello... I guess.: Just a thought...
curiositygotthebestofme:
I don’t see a lot of bigger women *on tumblr* in kinky/bdsm kind-of posts. I think ‘oh there should be more, body positivity etc.’ But then I’m like I don’t find/think they’re attractive. Yes. I am a big girl, it doesn’t mean I have to like it. I don’t like my size, I think it’s disgusting, I do…
I have been thinking something similar..how not many of the tumblr pictures are of bigger girls, but more than that, not many pictures i have seen on tumblr are of real girls who don’t have time to look perfect because they have jobs and lives and love cake and bacon. I am not a big girl by any means but the pictures still make feel like I need to look more like them to be attractive.. And that’s not true and I know it but constantly looking at those kinds of images still affects me..
