So a lot of people wanted pillow humping/grinding, and I got 300 followers finally so here‚Äôs a video of thanks for you guys
(Okay, maybe doing that got me a little flustered, might need to go take care of things if you get my meaning. I do take donations or people can message me privately and ask for my paypal and pay for a photoset or video)

Anonymous asked:Age-18, gender-M, height6'0", eye and hair are both dark brown. Natural dominican curly hair, I love drawing, but I also hate doing art. There's a retro pinball arcade next to a movie theater in uptown, I'd take you too both if I ever had the pleasure of a date with you.
That sounds lovely

Quick tutorial on how to pay artists for digital-only commissions ( which means no shipping)
If you choose the shipping option when the artists is only doing a digital commission, and paypal sees that the artist didn‚Äôt ship anything, it creates trouble for the artist, to put it simply. So let‚Äôs not do that!
1.)
2.)
for those paying through MOBILE
and you‚Äôre good!
For everyone who open commission ¬†:)
