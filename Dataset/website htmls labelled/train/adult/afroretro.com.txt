AFRORETRO OUT AND ABOUT...POP BRIXTON
We have a new home! Yay! We have moved into creative community hub Pop Brixton. We are super excited to have a studio space here where we'll be creating, designing and making all our AfroRetro products. If you've been to Pop you'll know it's a hive of creativity with great small Independent businesses selling food, drink, fashion, music and more. At present we will be just using our Pop studio as a working space, but in the very near future we'll this will be our home venue for all our workshops plus open studio Pop out markets where you can get your hands on our latest products!DAY OF THE GIRL
We joined a list of amazing women to take part in a mass speed mentoring event as part of WOW Festival's celebration of #DayOfTheGirl. Hosted at The London Eye a 100 influential women from the arts, science, broadcast, business and politics gathered to mentor young girls from schools across London. We were inspired and hoped to inspire the next generation of Women Game Changers. Listening to their dreams and anxieties we passed on the wisdom and experience of our varied life journeys.
