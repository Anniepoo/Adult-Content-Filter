Anonymous whispered, "Have any details been revealed about Adam and Christina during the season 10 blinds?"
theadamtinashipper:
Yes! Let me tell you:
First everyone said Christina was absolutely beautiful… Adam praised her a lot on the first day (the exact words were “he praised her so much he loves her”) and they had each other’s back a couple times. She sang “I Will Always Love You” after the crowd and Adam insisted a lot.
She brought Summer to the set! “As soon as they brought her out Christina held her and Adam was talking to Summer. And she hit Blake in the face which was pretty funny” I really hope they don’t cut any of that. Also they said Summer took pictures with the coaches on their chairs, pressing the button.
And I think the biggest thing was that Christina kissed a girl on the lips. Yes! On the lips! I can’t wait to see Adam’s reaction to that!
