Anonymous asked:
Congrats on hopefully meeting your daddy in April!! May I ask how you met him? I've been searching and searching for a good daddy and I've yet to find one. Any advice?
I actually met him on here! No, not the safest, but I love him unconditionally. He’s my everything. My other half. My heart. He’s absolutely wonderful! I’m so so so excite to see him 💛❤💙💜💚
Some general advice I would give is don’t rush it, your sweet pea will come soon enough, I promise. Don’t get discouraged or upset if something doesn’t work out. You can’t force love, it will happen naturally. By saying that I’m not saying you won’t get in fights, but that’s just part of relationships. Most importantly, STAY SAFE PLEASE. protect that pretty heart of yours, okay? Your heart is so so special and don’t let some cockhead ruin it. Also another safety is just general safety, check who you’re talking to. Make sure to Skype WITH a cam. Stuff like that. Your other half will arrive soon enough, sweetheart. 💖

~and those who are wondering, dada and I both have other people coming with us when we meet to be safe, we aren’t taking that risk~

Hi I was wondering if maybe you could help get the word out about my blog that's made to help littles and caregivers meet each other or even just friends! My friend and I started out as a twitter account but I wanted to expand so I created a sideblog; the url is ddlgsafehaven, thanks so much !!
Of course! (:
