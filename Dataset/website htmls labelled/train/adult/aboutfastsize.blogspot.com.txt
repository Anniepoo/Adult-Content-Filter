A whole new zest in my life
“I used Fastsize for three months and I’m happier ever since…”Just like in the ads…There goes the words of Grayson Collum, a 29-year-old male nurse, who can’t resist saying that just like an old clichéd commercial tag.
The 29-year-old admitted that he actually discovered the miracle of Fastsize inadvertently.
He claims that he had actually lost his belief in the many penis enlargement programs in the market nowadays, and Fastsize was just another shot out of curiosity…and in fact an attempt to prove just another penis enlargement site wrong.
And man, was he ever so surprised.“I was just curiously browsing the net, cursing and many a times snickering over the success testimonials written in those penis enlargement sites when I stumbled upon the Fastsize.com.
At first, just like many times lately, I just went to the testimonials link and began snickering at the e-mails of “satisfied” customers posted in there.
I do not really believe them at first.
I was skeptical, to say the least, having tried and tried and ultimately fails.”But curiosity “again” got the better of Gray.
“I used to always be timid and quiet every time my friends brag about the size of their penis.
I was used to avoiding sharing the shower with anyone especially at work.
I always wear loosely fitted pants.
And I used to have sex with my partners light off.
Back in those days, my ultimate fear is for my girlfriends telling on me so I always choose girls who are not from my town.”But three months of using Fastsize-Extender changed his life literally according to Mr. Collum.
“Yes, the Extender literally added gusto into my life.
It added 14 cm. to my previous size 4.3 inches and I’m happier ever since.
It’s not as if it’s a star material now, but it certainly made me feel more manly.
Now I am not anxious in sharing the shower anymore and I can enjoy making love with lights on.
I also feel more confident in my sexual encounters with my partners.
Now I can take pleasure in our intimate times together without any inhibition and fear.”

Penis Health
Maintaining a healthy penis is maybe one of the more important things all guys should be mindful of. As you grow older, biology takes its toll on your sexual capabilities. Testosterone levels decline starting at age 30 and continue to do so at a staggering rate of 10 percent per decade. This can really have grave effects on the quality of your sex life.
But there are several ways in which you can have a vigorous and healthy penis for many years to come. Leading a healthy lifestyle is key.· Follow a healthy, well-balanced diet. Consume a high fiber diet, low in saturated fats. This can help prevent or reduce the build up of fatty deposits in the arteries and ensure the continuous flow of blood to the penis. · Do not smoke. Smoking can cause erectile dysfunction, shrinkage of the penis, and high risk of impotence. · Exercise regularly. Exercise is also a way of preventing fatty deposits that can narrow or clog arteries, ensuring the quality of your erections.· Have regular erections. The penis needs oxygen to produce Prostaglandin E1, a substance that ensures good circulation and reduces the risk of impaired erectile function. So during sleep, guys have involuntary nocturnal erections to ensure providing the penis of enough oxygen levels. It is also recommended that you have regular erections while you are awake.· Ejaculate often. Aside from a great way of relieving stress, frequent ejaculations also keep the prostate healthy preventing a rather painful condition known as prostate congestion.
· Take nutritional supplements. Certain vitamins and minerals can be good for maintaining general penile health, such as Vitamin A, Vitamin B complex, Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Chromium, Zinc, and L-arginine. While certain herbs are known to be particularly helpful for weak erections or impotence, including Ginkgo biloba, Ginseng, Damania, Sarsaparilla, Wild yam, Saw palmetto, Dong quai, Gotu kola, Hydrangea root, and Pygeum.· Stimulate your penis. Penis exercises such as jelq and kegels can not only ensure good circulation but can also aid in penis enlargement, both in length and girth. The FastSize-Extender can help in that aspect. The FastSize-Extender uses traction to assist the human body’s natural ability to change and develop under physical influence. By exposing to a constant, permanent stretch, the cells in the chambers begin to divide and multiply, thus increasing the tissue mass. By maintaining a healthy lifestyle, you can be assured of greater erection strength and stamina, as well as general sexual satisfaction.

The FastSize-Extender and Self-Esteem
Penis size is a huge concern to many men, and women, alike. Most men obsess that their manhood is not big enough. They feel that having big penises make them more manly and better lovers. Their self-esteem and self-worth is displaced on their penises. What most men don’t realize is that according to recent studies and surveys, the average range of penis size falls between 5.5 to 6.4 inches in erect length and 4.7 to 5.2 inches in girth. Obsession with the penis size seems to emanate from male vanity rather than the pleasure it will give a woman. It appears that a guy’s fear is not that a woman will not enjoy sex because his penis is too small. Actually it’s the fear of being exposed as a small dicked man that is more terrifying. There is no doubt that the majority of men think “bigger equals better.” Well, actually, in some ways it does. Unsurprisingly, this obsession about penis sizes has spawned an industry solely devoted to penis enlargement. There is a whole gamut of penis enlargement methods and procedures you can choose from. One such is the traction method exemplified by the FastSize-Extender. The FastSize-Extender is a comfortable and easy-to-use device designed to aid in penile length and girth enhancement. It uses traction to assist the human body’s natural ability to change and develop under physical influence. By exposing to a constant, permanent stretch, the cells in the chambers begin to divide and multiply, thus increasing the tissue mass. This process allows the penis to hold more blood than it could before. As a result, enlargement can be noticed in both length and width (girth) of the penis. This can easily be translated as greater satisfaction in bed. So don’t let your penis take over you and your sex life. You should take control now and start giving your woman what she really wants.

Traction
The Use of Traction Devices for Penis EnlargementThe FastSize-Extender is non-surgical, comfortable and easy-to-use device designed to aid in penile length and girth enhancement. The FastSize-Extender uses traction (weights) to assist the human body’s natural ability to change and develop under physical influence. By exposing to a durable and regular traction, the cells in the penis chambers begin to divide and multiply, thus increasing the tissue mass. This process allows the penis to hold more blood than it could before. As a result, enlargement can be noticed in both length and width (girth) of the penis. The use of traction or weights to enlarge the penis is based on the principle of tensile force and the body's ability to adapt under such influence. This principle of has also been practiced for over 2,000 years by various cultures around the world. The neck lengthening exploits of the Paduang tribe of Burma is a well-documented example of such practices. As well as the lip and earlobe stretching practices of certain African tribes.The practice of hanging weights from the penis has been suggested as the method of penis enlargement by the pharaohs of ancient Egypt. The practice is likewise evident in certain African tribes such as the Karamojong of the northeastern Uganda. At puberty, a Karamojong boy was said to hang stone disks from the tip of his penis. More and more disks are added until it reaches to about 20 pounds by the time he is a teenager. By then, his penis could measure up to 18 inches or longer. The FastSize-Extender, a specially-developed traction device, is based on the same principle, although modernized and relatively safer. The FastSize-Extender comes with a specially-designed ring made of plastic material that is assured to fit ergonomically every penis size and a plastic and silicone holder that is fastened around the penis head. Between the ring and the holder, two dynamic metal bars are attached applying an adjustable tension between 1.5 and 3.5 lbs. The FastSize-Extender can be used any time of the day for various time intervals, as you please.As compared with other methods of penile enlargement, the FastSize-Extender offers a solid, durable, and high quality workmanship that is easily the competitive option for a long-term, high-yield investment.
