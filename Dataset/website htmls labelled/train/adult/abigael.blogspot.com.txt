Beta Testers Needed - Referrals 2 - New Adsense CPA Program
I need Help with our new Adsense CPA product. read below to find out.I've been working on the web very successfully for 11 years now,Prior to Adsense coming along, we had a very nice little system that convertedbetween 10 and 20 percent of visitorsto our sites. This totalled more than 4.5 million conversions (conversions isall I can say for now, till release of our product)When Adsense came around I wanted to use these same strategies with my Adsensesites, but for the life of me, I couldn'tfigure it out.And THEN "Adsense CPA" is started its roll out,SEE:http://adsense.blogspot.com/2007/06/referrals-20-launches-to-all-adsense.htmlMy account was one of the first to get it. and BANG,ALL the bangs and whistles went off in my brain and I saw the light, Now itsentirely possible to get these same conversionsI was getting prior to Adsense.I have now created the system to make Adsense sites, That just keep giving andgiving and giving on absolute autopilot.(btw.. giving = profits)This system increases your income opportunities by up to 300%, that's 3 timesthe opportunity to make money from each and everyone of your sitesvisitors, and KEEP themMy team and I have been working flat out to get this system in place, its been acombined effort of 10 people working flat outthe last 4 weeks to get this happening, merging 3 backend systems into onesimple to use online interface.Our goal is to make our products as easy to use as possible, thus we need tobeta test these products with fresh minds, notlike ours that are too deep in them to see simple ways to make the userexperience faster and easier.

NO 1 Infopreneur Peter Drew
NO 1 Infopreneur Peter Drew I often get asked, what it is that I do.I've never really had a good and accurate answer, Till I saw a post on a forumby Dr. Mani. including the word" Infopreneur "Now this word Infopreneur is the Perfect word to describe what I do.Looking up Infopreneur at www.dictionary.com states
"–noun
a person whose business is gathering, processing, and
providing information to advertising, marketing, and other
firms" This is an ok description about Infopreneur
Though I would say this."A Person with considerable initiative who organises and manages many enterprises specifically related to the creation of and distribution of Information, thus being a Infopreneur." This to me makes more sense about what a Infopreneur actually is. Infopreneur is a relatively new word that has recently arrived in the English language as a result of the information and technology boom since the arrival of the internet.If you Google the wordInfopreneur currently there are exactly 139,000 results which is not many results for any word in the English language, for example the wordentrepreneur results in 52,300,000 pages contain this word. This shows how very new the word Infopreneur truly is.Wikipedia has an interesting take on the word Infopreneur. Stating "The term, infopreneur, is often used on the Internet. This term is a neologism derived from the words "information" and "entrepreneur". An infopreneur is generally considered an entrepreneur who makes money selling information on the Internet. They use existing data and target an audience. Although before the explosive popularity of the Internet, at the turn of the millennium, such an occupation already existed."More about how Peter Drew of www.peterdrew.net will be Listed No1 for the term Infopreneur in google soon.
