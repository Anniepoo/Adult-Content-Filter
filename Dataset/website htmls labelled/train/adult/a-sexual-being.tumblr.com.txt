A Sexual Being
A Sexual Being
NSFW; 18+ only.
I'm a masochistic babygirl with a sadistic Daddy exploring D/s and connecting with people who get my brand of kink or at least respect it. I'm a submissive but not YOUR submissive, so show me a little respect, and you'll receive respect...

Our Family is Growing #WickedWednesday
When I say our family is growing, I am definitely not talking about babies (this factory is closed, thank you very much!).
I’m not talking about families in a sexual, kinky, or even poly kind of way, although polyamory is something John Brownstone and I are actively learning more about.
Nope. We got a dog, y’all!
I’ve had dogs most of my life, except for past three or four years. They’ve always…View On WordPress

Bondage for Beginners #infographic #BDSM @CarvakaSexToys
I love having good information to share. When Carvaka Sex Toys sent me this infographic and asked if I wanted to share it with everyone, I said, “Absolutely!” For those of you who’ve been into bondage for years, this be stuff you already know, but for everyone else who’s just learning, this has some good, basic information to keep in mind as you explore your kinky bondage side.View On WordPress

Spend even a few moments in the arms of a Dominant, and you’ll quickly learn that you never get exactly what you ask for, but – if you’re lucky – you’ll get exactly what you need.
Last week’s pseudo-demand put me in the mood for something rough and primal. I wanted to be taken and used. I needed to feel both extremes of our sexual play – the fierce sexuality and the warm love.

When Scorpio Is Being Super Lazy | TheZodiacCity
zodiaccity:
Just have to be honest here, Scorpios can be huge procrastinators. When the mood strikes, the simplest things seems like daunting tasks. Sure, they are relentless in many things but not doing anything…is one of those things sometimes.Want to see more zodiac facts, head over to thezodiaccity.com.

It’s the little domestic things that get me.
tasteforpunishment:
stayskinnyandclassyforhim:
thedominantword:
Ask me what I want for dinner. Bring me a beer. Ask me what you should wear. Ask permission to schedule a date with your girlfriends. Ask permission to buy something even though it’s under your limit. Ask permission for everything.
Defer to me. Tell salespeople “I’ll have to ask my husband.”
💖💖💖
ugh I want this so bad
Doing things like this keeps me in a submissive frame of mind even in the most chaotic day.

Even Good Dominants Shouldn’t Be Put on a Pedestal #podcast
Even Good Dominants Shouldn’t Be Put on a Pedestal #podcastI tease John Brownstone…a lot. Of course, he teases me even more. Something about getting my babygirl riled up and watching me stomp my feet and pout just cracks him up.
We pick on each other, using our natural sarcastic abilities.
So when one of us does something very “vanilla” – meaning something “typical” – we pounce on it.
Lately, I’ve spent time teasing a certain Daddy Dom when he’s been…View On WordPress

Don’t Put Your Dominant on a Pedestal LB020Kayla Lords hosts this week’s show, and she’s discussing the very real truth that Dominants are (gasp!) not perfect, prone to normal human flaws, and shouldn’t be put up on a pedestal by submissives – no matter how great a Dominant they may be.
In this episode:
Kayla was reminded just how perfectly imperfect John Brownstone is and shares her silly teasing.
Dominants are people and will do things…
