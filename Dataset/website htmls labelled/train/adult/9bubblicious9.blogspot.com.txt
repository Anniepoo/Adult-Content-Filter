I Love Fourteen Year Olds!
Isn't it fun to "dress up" and be some one else for day or two? This weekend I got to be my 14 yr-old self. I hung out with Adam and his friends the whole time. On Friday, I saw Robot with Tilly. ::giggles:: On Saturday, I went to the mall with Adam, Charlotte, and Mom. I got to go to Trader Joe's for my first time. That place is awesome! And then I met up with Adam and Charlotte who were playing DDR in the arcade. We went home and dyed Adam's hair BLACK. You have to see this! www.bubbliciouspictures.blogspot.com He used to be blonde for those of you who don't know him. So then we had leftover dye so I let Charlotte play with my hair. She is AMAZING! She put a black chunk where the short piece sweeps across my forehead. She also did a black underneath and red tips. Subtle but sexy. Hahah. We had fun! Then we forced Adam to wear eyeliner. Muahahah. We also watched fight club. "I am Jill's nipple."Then on Sunday I got my dose of the addicting game of DDR (Dance Dance Revolution for you idiots living under a rock). Adam, Jared, and I walked to Charlotte's and played it all day. I am REALLY bad and not at all graceful. Haha. But it's still fun. So we went home and I don't know what I did. Probably watched Alias because I'm pathetic like that. Now I am home and NOT at school because I wasn't feeling so well. I guess I'll go work on my english project or something. Ya know, be productive. Hahaha. Love you all.Always,Laurel

Hmmm.....
Wow. That week went by fast. Now what do I do with myself? I guess I could mirror last weekend and twiddle my thumbs for 48 straight hours. Aye. I wish Stop & Shop would just go ahead and hire me alrighty so I have something for me to do. When I'm alone I think too much and depress myself. It's annoying. I know I was supposed to update this more, but I failed. But here I am at quarter to 4 writing a pointless rambling entry.So today was a good day I suppose. Double Chemistry. Woot. Chelsea and I forgot to weigh our magnesium..... Oops. And I had a shadow yesterday! My brother's friend Nicole came for half the day, like shadows do. She really liked it even though she got a double french, chem, and algebra II with trig. What a good sport. =P Mr. Halligan had his keys stolen today and Hayley and I got to play detective. We sucked at it. But hey! He got them back so we must have been doing something write. ::winks:: Hahah.I've reached that point where I'm tired of being lazy. I've had my fun doing..... nothing, and it's definitely time to grow up. My grades are slipping, I can't drive, I don't have a job. Time to shape up. So I'm doing all my homework and I'm starting to drive more, and I applied for that job. It's a good start! All in one week too. Hurrah for me.I think I'll go to bed. It's that time. Tomorrow I'm waking up to go Christmas Tree Shopping avec mi madre. Whee! OH SHIT! I have an English project due Monday! Ughhhhhhh. I better do THAT too. Well good night my dears.Always,Laurel

The sky looks like patchwork? You don't say.
Hey! I guess I should continue updating this thing because I've had it for so long and to let it die would be a shame. So I'm gonna stop being lame (that rhymes) and just update the thing. So My vacation was extremely awesome! I went to Labadee, Haiti..... Ocho Rios, Jamaica..... Grand Cayman Islands..... And Cozumel, Mexico. Ooh and Miami but only to board and get off the cruise. We went on the Navigator of the Seas, which is a Royal Caribbean boat and it was the best vacation I ever had.So we met this great group of people: Pete, Tim, Jeb, Alex, Max, Rebecca (Ninja), Nadia, Isaac, Chris, Strawberry, Ryan, Ashley, and some other random awesome people. They were so fucking cool! And I already miss them tons. But yea we invaded the stupid toga parties that Fuel (the ever-so-trendy teenage night club) threw and danced [and got kick out of] the Disco Party for the 12-14 year olds. It was great. One night we stayed out and watched the sunrise. Congratulations to the survivors of that night: Pete, Tim, Alex, Max, Ryan, Isaac, Me, and that little kid that never slept. Hahahah. I posted a million bajillion pictures as I'm sure you saw. Or didn't. That's cool too. But if ya want to check them out you know where they're at: www.bubbliciouspicture.blogspot.com~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~LABADEE, HAITI: I won't bore you for hours, but I will give a brief description of each place. Labadee was half relaxing and calm and half busy and stressful. The marketplace was full of money hungry, poverty-stricken salespeople who would grab you and pull you over to their stands and try to sell you useless crap you really didn't need. I bought a few things [including sunglasses] and learned how to say no..... eventually. I feel bad for them! Too goddamn nice for my own good. So then we went to Hideaway Beach, got us a couple of Coco Loco drinks and sat in the sun. Stupid Little me didn't realize the Caribbean sun is MUCH stronger than Cape Cod's. Therefore, I got BURNT! Like to a crisp. And I felt that pain for a while, but now I have a tan. So hurrah. So it was overall a great day.OCHO RIOS, JAMAICA: It was slightly cloudy, but still nice out. We were ushered to a mini-bus thing and then driven by a crazy Jamaican man to Dunn's River Falls [Bitch not included]. So we get in this huge line of people and hold hands and climb up this huge waterfall. Fuuuuun. It actually was. So then we get bussed to Dolphin Cove, where we got the experience of a lifetime. We jumped into the cove and swam with the dolphins! It was so friggin' awesome. I'm pissed we didn't buy any pictures. So our dolphin's name was Suggi. she did these tricks and we got to pet her and kiss her. It was amazing. But afterwards, we were all wet and gross and we had to go shopping. Jamaica is awesome, but crazy. My friends Alex and Max were offered drugs 5 times. Hahaha. And everyone wanted to braid Alex's pretty long hair. =P I think I only bought one little thing for a buck in Jamaica. I was pretty stingy this vacation. Sorry I didn't bring any one back stuff. I'm such a bitch. So yea, that was Ocho Rios.GRAND CAYMAN: This place was pretty awesome. We left Adam on the ship because he wouldn't wake up and then we took a bus tour of the island and stopped at the Tortuga Rum Factory (Muahahah! Free samples!), Michael Jordan's house (Oooh. Aaah. Rich bastard.), the gorgeous end of the 7 mile beach, and Hell! Yes, there is a town called Hell. They overdid the theme a little bit, but it was still cool. There are these natural rock phenomenons that are the source of the name Hell and they're crazy! After that we checked out Hurrican Ivan damage, which was horrible, and then went to the Turtle farm! Yay for turtles! Turtles are a Grand Cayman delicacy! Isn't that nasty?! So cruel. So yea then we went to this lunch place, I had a delish strawberry daiquiri, and we boarded the ship. That was that.COZUMEL, MEXICO: What a dirrrrrrty city. Like whoa. It smelled like sewage and was dusty and not pretty to look at. And there were creepy clown heads everywhere. We basically just went for the free stuff. Hahah. We should have done snorkeling or something. But yea we had a bunch of coupons for free junk so I went on a scavenger hunt. Woo woo! I got a midnight sapphire out of it though. I just need to set it in a ring or something. So yea. There were these crazy Mexican people that kept trying to braid my hair. And they shook this head with braids at me and it was really scary. Scurrrred for life. But there was this AWESOME restaurant called Carlos N' Charlie's that we went to. It was wicked crowded and everyone was dancing and getting drunk off their asses. 'The Yard' is a beautiful thing. It's their specialty drink glass and it it HUGE. CHEERS! Hahahah. The lighting in there was crazy and every one was so casual and cool. Women were running around blowing whistles, pouring shots in guy's mouths, and then slapping their ass. Like..... that was their job. I told Mom I was applying and she gave me the evil eye. Hahahah. So then we went back to the ship and called it a crazy day viva la Mexico.That night I went to be at 7:00 AM. Fun stuff. Then we had our final day on the boat at sea. We hung out with our pals as much as possible. I never did get to do the rock wall. =( So yea. Our last day was great. We hung out in Promenade (Deck 5, a huge mall center thing) We listened to a great guitar singer who pulled Tim up on stage and they sang "Time Of Your Life" by Green Day and it became our song. Just like that. We all headed off to bed around midnight. In the morning we woke up really early and ate breakfast, then said good-bye to our beautiful ship. Luckily though, our flight was with Peter, Tim [Hahahaha. Sleeping in the terminal after a 2 hour delay], Chris, and Heather. So yea. That was my wonderful cruise. It was good to see Baxter again and sleep in my own bed.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Okay, I'm done. I swear. Hahaha. Life has been fine since I've got home. It was great to see all my real friends. I missed them sooo much. Brianna got her second operation and has been really strong and recovering excellently. Tilly saw her father over vacation and she's been so sextacular lately! Clayton moved into his AMAZING new house in his AMAZING new room and on his AMAZING new bed. Hahahah. Merissa made it to 3 days of school in a row and I got to hang out with her one Saturday. Hurrah! Melanie had her sweet 16th over vacation. HAPPY BIRTHDAY MEL! I still owe her a present. And she is the next person I buy anything for. When I get money. I still need a job. I'm working on it. I'll probably do something lame like Stop & Shop, but hey. $$$$$ is $$$$$. I better go.Oh no. I've said too much.Love you all!Laurel

'Tis Vacation?!
Geeez. I fucking suck at updating. I hate myself too. Kind of. Actually I don't give a shit. But, I should be in History class right now, but when I woke up this morning my parents told me to go back to bed. And I had no trouble obeying that order. Apparently, I will not be getting any sleep tonight seeing our flight to Miami is at 6 in the fucking morning. YAY! Hahaha. So today we slept, packed, and prepared. For all of you that I haven't told, this February vacation I am actually DOING something! Ooh la la! Yes. We are going on a cruise (we being my family of 4) and we are going to the Caribbean. The places we are going include, Jamaica, Mexico, and other places. I am very excited. I have never been out of this crazy country. I will miss my friends sooo much though. I'm pissed I didn't get to go to school today though. I wanted to say good-bye to everyone and I had two tests and such. Meh. I'm such a dork.Yay! I am listening to the Austin Powers Soundtrack. The first movie. Hahahah. I love hippie music. Everyone should download "Incense and Peppermints" by Strawberry Alarm Clock and then thank me for the wonderful idea. So anyway, I probably over packed like usual but at least I'll have a lot of outfit options. Which is what I love. ::smirks:: I better meet some hot guy on this cruise. Do I constantly need male attention? Eh, so what. Every girl does. I just admit it. And act on it. I'm flirty, not slutty. There is a fine line and I don't cross it. I'm completely babbling about nothing. Anyway, back to the cruise. It's all vacation. I will be back in time to have Sunday and who knows what I'll do. Or if I'll just sleep all day. Because I plan on getting up early every day and going exercising and such. I'm coming back with a tan and lost weight. YAY!Mmmm..... there will be glorious showers. Yessss. We have been without a shower for a week. And let me tell you, I took my shower for granted! Our new one better be fucking AMAZING. So yea the sink and other people's houses has been my shower. Ew. I'm gross. 3 real showers in the past week. 3 sink washes. Dirty whooooooore. So far, the Hoxies, Grammy Bruce, and Senator Kennedy have all been kind enough to let me use their showers. Josh's shower was the bestttttt. Grammy's was cold. And the last one was eh. I am rambling again. My blog is going for a record or most boring blog ever in the entire blog community. Vote for me!..... And PedroBlah blah blah blah ramble ramble blah.I MISS MY PUPPY ALREADY! We had to give him to this lady for a week and he's probably depressed and scared. I don't like her very much. -sigh- We should have put him in Clayton's work. Grrrr. I hope he'll be all right. He's pretty spoiled. But he's the best dog ever. She's lucky to live with him for a week. Bitch.I got my report card. I shall post it now.Subject

96So yea awesome. I kicked ass on the ERB tests too. CAUSE I'M ASHTON KUTCHER! AND I'M AWESOME!..... My brother thinks I've developed a case of Tourettes and I hope so. Because it's fucking hilarious. I came slowly down stairs the other day and he didn't see me. I randomly screamed and he jumped so high. It was fucking hilarious. HAHAHAHAHAHAH! I did it again. I just turned around and screamed at him to see what would happen. And he twitched. Fucking awesome. "It's shocking. You are so bizarre." Loser. ::giggles:: The plane ride should be fun. If I'm not scared to death. Okay, I'm leaving. Gonna kick some virtual ass in Internet pool. Which I am addicted to. I love you all and I'll miss you so freaking much!Always,Laurel

I guess I should update this stupid thing. Ummm new pictures over at ye olde picture blog. They're stupid as usual. But go anyway. To give me the satisfaction.
Had Tilly sleepover Wednesday night. We had fuuuun. As usual. Watched the amazing Garden State again. I've seen it so many times by now and I have yet to get sick of it. So yea. We watched some Alias too and fucked up her mp3 player pretty bad. Sorry darling!
19 minutes before it's back to reality. I haven't been sleeping well. I should have listened to Brianna. She's always right. I have been trying to get it back to normal and away from that 5 AM to 2 PM sleep schedule, but I just can't fall asleep. Let's hope tonight is different since tomorrow is my first day of school in 9 days. ::crosses fingers:: Of course I have to watch Nip/Tuck first. ::smirks::
So yea. My second social encounter of this little break was shoveling at my Grandmother's house yesterday and then I went to Clayton's! Whee! I love that kid so much. We had an aweeeeeeeesome time and further proved that I am indeed a goof. =P -sigh- Clayton Darling- thanks for having me over! We both needed social interactions. *kisssss*
So Brianna is on a roll with showing how incredibly stupid I am. Hahahah. Gotta love the girl. And I do I do. In fact, I love all my friends SO FUCKING MUCH! I have been meaning to write this entry for a while seeing my epiphany was like a week ago, but yea. Without them, I would be dead. Even when I am completely depressed, give them an hour and I'll be on the floor laughing again. Some days after a bad night and morning I'll come into school thinking "I'm going to be in a bad mood allllll day." However, by the time I round the corner and see my friends at our lockers I just smile and forget whatever the hell I was so pissed about. They are truly amazing. Thank you so much for everything.
YYYYY TO ALL MY FRIENDS..... I LOVE YOU GUYS! YYYYY
Loooooove, Laurel
