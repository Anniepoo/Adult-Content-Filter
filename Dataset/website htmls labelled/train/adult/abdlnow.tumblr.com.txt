So, I got a pack of the new Crinklz nappies to try! As you can see, they have a super cute design :)
They have an elasticated waistband at the front and back which is always nice, and the plastic feels smooth and soft. They are thick but not too thick - you can definitely get away with them under a pair of jeans.
They hold loads! I did 4 wees in one (2 big ones and 2 little ones) and there was still loads of dry padding at the back when I took it off. I normally leak on wee number 3, so to not be soaked after 4 means these are pretty special.
I was wearing this under my footed all in one pyjamas, and I don’t know if it just got too warm or it was rubbing, but the two right tabs popped off. Luckily it uses the blue tape system so I was able to re-stick, but it didn’t stay stuck for long, which I why I took it off instead of using it to it’s full potential.
This is probably a one off though, as I’ve never had this problem before with any Crinklz products.
If you get a chance to try these, I would love to see pics and hear what you thought of them!!

Patiently waiting for Daddy 😇
He has gotten so comfortable with me wearing, it’s awesome!
But it hasn’t always been that way. It’s been a slow and delicate process introducing him to this kink.
I can help walk you through introducing ABDL to your vanilla partner. It starts with building your confidence.

My little girl is about 1-2 inches taller than me. And I’ve been a twig all my life.
This is cute. I’m taller than my mommy but she has no problem still making me feel like her little baby
I’m in a wheelchair and my littles still end up in a perfect headspace when they are with me
THIS
Was really just thinking on this the other day.  Sorrel and I are both overweight, and I’m a good foot taller than her (which, outside of any ageplay considerations, is awesome and makes dancing very comfortable).  It just feels sometimes like all the littles we actually see or hear about are these tiny little pixie folk who fit into Pull-Ups and…eh, just occasionally feels like there’s no real place in the community for overweight folks who are average looking, wear large diapers, and in my case are over 30.
It’s something I’m really self conscious about - I’m fat & agender, & I’m worried i won’t be able to find any other ageplaying types who’d want to Top someone like me, when I’d be a good deal bigger than them.
I would be lying if I said being over 6 feet didn’t make me feel like it’s harder to be taken seriously as a little than say a 5’4 girl. This is very reassuring to see.
I’m about 5’9 and a size 18. Daddy is a couple inches shorter and much skinnier. Size has nothing to do with it. He’s still perfect at making me feel like a safe, protected, loved little. I feel so small when I’m with him and I love it so much!
All littles are little no matter their size. <3
I’m 5′10″ and my wife/Mamma is 5′2″.  We are sooo different in size…but Mamma is awesome when we are out, and she takes me by the hand, and keeps me safe.  Snuggling in bed, i get right in close…and feel like i’m soooo little.  It’s about comfort, and being in littlespace….with someone you trust, love, and respect.

Daddy made me take a certain number of cute pictures in my wet diaper tonight before he let me change. Hmph.
Thank goodness I’m a pretty princess who has no problem with vanity homework that boosts my ego. 😋 🎀 💜

Galaxy boobs. I am in love ❤️✨🌟 who knew a couple clothes pins could do such beautiful damage.
I can’t even begin to explain the sense of euphoria that makes it way through my entire body whenever I take a beating to my chest. Going even further this time and making my self bleed? Oh ya. Definitely gonna save those moments to my fap bank.
