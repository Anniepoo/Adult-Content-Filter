Strong words to use on a Resume
rampyourvoice:
ladyhinata:
If you have ever had to write a resume for work or for an application, then you know the hardest part is figuring out what type of words to use that sound professional and and intelligent.
Example: If an application asks you if you have any relevant experience for a job at a day care center and you have experience, like you have babysat children. You would look at the words in the columns to see what words you should use that will help your resume stand out. You might put down “Have supervised and attended to children on a regular basis.”
I hope this is helpful to you.
Now this is a great resume list of action words.  I love that it’s broken down by types of jobs.  Saving for future use.

When a Muslim woman tells you about Muslim misogyny, your first response should not be “Well I am not like that. I am not passing that to my kids” or something else along those lines. What you should do is accept that you have male privilege, you have been socialised since birth to be sexist and there will always be ingrained problematic beliefs that probably will take a lifetime to unlearn. In your case, you had been socialised into believing that your male privilege is divinely ordained as a Muslim man, and that it is both part of the natural order and God’s will.
Every man in this society is sexist to some extent, because it’s ingrained. What defines you as a person is being willing to unlearn it and listen when you get called out by a woman for anything you say.
