"Monday Morning Coffee"
Where to begin on the first Monday of 2015? Well I sure as hell don't know.
Not sure if I expected this Monday to be any different from any other Monday in 2014, but anyways....The real question for today is how am I going to start off the 2015 year?
Well I could bore myself with all the obvious ...eat healthy, exercise, lose weight,,,blah blah blah but instead I am not going to make the same resolutions, but set so to speak goals for myself.
Goal #1...I have gotten away from a passion of mine that I really want to get back into and that is reading..so I have decided instead of challenging myself to read ex number of books a year ..I am simply going to choose one book from my Library weather its one I have had and haven't read yet ..or if its a re-read from a series that I have already started and just need some dusting off from the bookshelf..So with out further udo..the book I have chosen for this week....is *drum roll* Jacie Burton's Play by Play Series "The Perfect Play" .
.Seem how its about football I felt it appropriate since we are at the final few weeks of the season and we are all eager to see who makes it to the Super Bowl.
Goal #2..Financial ...
I am the worlds worst when it comes to finances ..so I have decided to make this a challenge for myself.  As I have set a personal goal that doesnt' really apply to the whole New Year's thing ,,and that is to move out of this god forsaken west Texas town ..I am doing the 52 week money challenge.
So I have my book for the week and a whole $1 in the piggy bank.....
There will be more goals as time goes by but these are just a couple to get me started!

Button made by Missie at The Unread Reader and Diana at Book of Secrets
So I started this last week and thoroughly enjoyed it,,,I love looking at covers of books its usually the first thing that grabs my attention if I would like to read it...Im running behind this week but didn't want to miss out on sharing another one of my favorite covers,,,,this week, I picked one out of my "hot covers file" none other than Kresley Cole's Dark Needs at Night's Edge,,,for several reasons 1. the man is yummy and one of my favorite cover models,,too bad I dont know his name *pouts* Maybe one of you fabulous ladies could help me out on that *wiggling eyebrows* The IMAD is in my top 10 of favorite series, and this happens to be one of my favorite books out of it,,cause lets face it, he is a tasty , "I want you suck my blood" kind of Vampire,,,,*weg*

Question of the Week: If you could trade wardrobes with one book character who would it be and why?
*thinking, thinking*Hmmmmm,,,,,,this is kind of a tough one cause half the time Im not paying to much attention to what the the characters are wearing,,most of the times its really what there not wearing,,just saying *grins* But after some serious thought I would have to say Christian Grey from 50 Shades,,mainly because he had it all from casual, to sleep to dressy, to business ,,,he had something for every occasion and that would be the kind of wardrobe I would like to have in my closet,,,,,,

"Waiting on Wenesday" July 4, 2012
Edit Post
"Waiting On" Wednesday is a weekly event, hosted at "Breaking the Spine" that spotlights upcoming releases that we're eagerly anticipating.
First Happy 4th everybody,,,At the moment due to my last 2 nights at my job the 4th is not one of my most anticipated holidays,,but o'well,,Anyways...to get back to why I am here... Over the last couple of years there has been a few Series that I don't ever put down and always eagerly waiting for the next year for the next book to come out,,,,and though my love still stands with Vampires and "The Blackdagger Brother Hood" is where my loyalty lies,,I do enjoy J.R. Ward's Fallen Angel Series and so the book that I am waiting for that is coming out soon is her next addition...Rapture #4 in The Fallen Angel Series
Mels Carmichael, reporter for the Caldwell Courier Journal, gets the shock of her life when a man stumbles in front of her car outside the local cemetery. After the accident, his amnesia is just the kind of mystery she likes to solve, but she soon discovers they're over their heads with his past. Over their heads with passion, too ...As shadows walk the line between reality and another realm, and her lover's memory begins to come back, the two of them learn that nothing is truly dead and buried. Especially when you're trapped in a no-holds-barred war between angels and demons. With a soul on the line, and Mels's heart at risk, what in heaven - or in hell - will it take to save them both?
