Marry your best friend. Fooling around is fun, but life gets in the way and when it gets hard, you’d wanna be married to your best friend.

On April 26th, 2015 my beautiful wife and I got married. She absolutely took my breath away when I first saw her…she’s been my rock and my best friend ever since we met. Sure we have our differences but that’s what makes us…us! I cannot wait to continue on this beautiful journey together…a house…pets…just living life…I love this girl to death…and she is my forever <3

Anonymous asked:
Hi, I got married last month and now I'm writing a book of lesbian wedding inspiration. Is there any chance you could help me find engaged/married couples to interview? There's more info plus some shareable images here if you go to my website (JoannaLKMoore) and search for 'lesbian wedding inspiration'. Alternatively, would you be interested in being interviewed for it? Thanks so much either way!
Hi, I’d be interested in being interviewed if you come off Anon :)

Brooke & ChelseaBrentwood, Los Angeles, CA. 2015Such a beautiful wedding on such a beautiful day. Brooke & Chelsea met each other in high school, and immediately hated each other. Years later, they exchanged “I do’s” and are now going to spend the rest of their lives together. My first lesbian wedding couldn’t have gone any better!
