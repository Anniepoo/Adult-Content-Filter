Family visits
Family visits are such a peculiar form of torturing and testing and whatever else makes you nerves and irritated. Family visits are about those people who are lucky to live far away from their homes and their relatives. Though, no matter how far they have ran away a day will come when they are obliged to see their relatives. As a rule those are holidays or celebration when people of one family gather together. And it usually takes all the strength you have to overcome those meeting, when you meet they are happy to see you because they haven’t seen you for ages and they really miss you. But, this precious and sweet feeling lasts for no longer than two days, and after those days pass the real torturing starts. They making their questions about your life and about your private life, though indeed they don’t need those answers you give them, they only need something to comment on and to express their point of view to your life. And this point of view is always of the same kind – you are wrong and they are right and they are going to teach you how to live.

Far away from home
Some people spend their whole life at one place. They have their birth city and stay there for the whole life because they have friends there and they have their parents there and the whole life is there. But, there are also people of different kind and they are leaving their birthplaces and go someplace else. They are always in search and they are looking for something or they just went away for studying and made a decision to stay at that foreign city. One way or another they are people who live far away from their relatives and they are actually happy people, they are on their own and there are no parents who tell them what to do and there are no relative who always care about them. There is only that city they are at and them and nothing else and it is a situation close enough to happiness. There was a man who said the best love towards relatives is a love multiplied with miles and it is so indeed. When one is far from their parents the relations between them are simply perfect and they love each other and care about each other. Though, when they are right by your side… well, they’d better don’t.

Divorce rips a family apart
There are many issues and emotions that a family experiences when a divorce is suggested. Divorce is one of the biggest reasons for a family splitting both physically and emotionally. Not only does the couple who are getting a divorce face hurt but everyone involved does too. The children especially are hurt by the ordeal as it demolishes every bit of structure in the household. This of course is not always the case. It usually takes really strong and matured parents to put the needs of their children first and ensure that the structure of the family remains and that regardless of the divorce, the family is still functional and normal. However, there are parents whom although they care about their kids feelings are much to hurt to look past their own grief.When a divorce occurs in a family and there are children involved there are a few things parents should remember. Firstly, no matter how old the child is it is always healthy to talk about what has and is occurring. Just because you don’t talk about it, it does not mean that your children will get over it. The opposite in fact will happen. By not getting how they feel off their chests, it will constantly run through their minds and they might think everything is their fault.
Remember that divorce brings plenty of hurt to a family so keeping things as normal as possible is important. Divorce tears up a family but as long as children have one parent who is strong enough, they feel safe and secure.

Heart Of Family
Is a parent the heart of the family or is a child the heart of the family? Family matters are crucial to our lifestyles and we often become a bit confused about where the family should center its focus. Parents, who are just people who had children and either do a very good job or not so much, have the right to a life outside of the family. Children, on the other hand, need constant guidance and the need to know who is in charge. Would you hand over your car keys, your business keys, and your house keys to your child and force them to run the ship for a little while? Most likely not so much. But you would like them to become a functional member of society while representing you well. That’s rather typical of parental behavior.What happens when a son or a daughter is not only unruly about the potential for parental interference, but becomes the center of the family attention that needs to be spread throughout the rest of the children. This is usually the result of some rather unappreciated behavior. Kids need guidance and they certainly need their issues dealt with, but kids need the parent to be the heart of the family. They need to know that there will be someone there to help pick up the pieces at the end of the day, or the month, when their life experience has left them heart broken and in search of security. A parent that is the heart of the family can offer that to their child.
