Craving Popiah
_ Bethesda Church At Katong._ A sudden craving of popiah brought me to the Dunman Food Centre._ After that on my way to take bus 16 to town to meet James and OKX for dinner and pool (which lasted 5 freaking hours), I came a cross this church. Maybe it was the lighting, I felt compelled to take a photo of the Bethesda Church At Katong.Labels: Daily Photo, Farts

VW Beetle Vectorised
_ I have been putting this off for a long time now. By "this" I meant vectorising daily objects such as the vintage VW Beetle. By vectorising I meant tracing it in Adobe Illustrator or other such vector softwares._ Today, I did just that. Below is the step by step illustrated show and tell of what I went through for the past gruelling 12 hours._ First hour:_ Doing the easiest shapes first. Here's the next three hours:_ I was tired of just doing shapes so I did some shading as well. First to the headlights then the door handle and I added colour so it wasn't so boring to look at. Of course, after sometime I grew tired and was too lazy to save all the steps. So, here is the final product:_ Although not shown in the above images, I had the 50% reduced opacity photo of the Beetle underneath my artwork all the time._ Here are some close up details of the vectorised Beetle:_ Basically, this is just a small part of a bigger series of self-training sessions I am putting myself through for the next two years. Hopefully, I will be good enough in the end even my beloved government wants me to do some of their work!Labels: My fArt Work

300 Trailer
_ If you read enough of my blog, you will know that I am a Frank Miller fan. So much so that people should already be shutting me up about how I am a Frank Miller fan._ One of Frank Miller greatest works, artistically, 300 is being made into a movie and its amazing new trailer is out._ It is really a huge testament, to how revered the Great Artist is, when two movies are styled exactly from the pages of his Great Works - the other being Sin City and soon Sin City 2 with Angelina Jolie._ Here is the trailer._ Or go for the Quicktime version.[Link]Labels: I Love Comics, I Love Movies

This is the end, beautiful friend.
This is the end, my only friend.
The end of our elaborate plans,
The end of everything that stands.
