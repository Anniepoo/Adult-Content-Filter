We invite you to attend the 4th Annual Florida Masters Event to be held July 17 - 20, 2008. At the Marriott Airport in Orlando, Florida. We are so excited, as this promises to be one of the best events ever.
We're proud to say that we have been able to secure a fabulous group of Instructors including: Masters in Line, John Robinson, Scott Blevins, Guyton Mundy, Max Perry, Kathy Hunyadi,
Bill McGee, Marilyn McNeal, Craig Bennett, Arlene Winerman, and Suzanne Wilson. All of our instructors have been busy choreographing and learning the hottest new dances, savoring the best to share with you!!
Come and have fun with us, dancing until all hours, and then plan to extend your stay and experience all that Orlando has to offer. Whether it be a day at one of the many theme parks, shopping at a mall, or just relaxing by the pool this event will be well worth attending.
