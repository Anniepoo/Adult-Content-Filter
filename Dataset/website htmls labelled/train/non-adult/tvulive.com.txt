About RadioU This is where you go to find out what's NEXT.
It's not about the same ten songs you hear every hour on other corporate-run stations. The music we play is different. It's the stuff THEY don't play. It's where music is going.
Listen live 24/7 for bands like Switchfoot, Family Force 5, House Of Heroes, Red, and Project 86. The R!OT with Obadiah and Nikki every morning, RadioU's Ten Most Wanted, and more.
