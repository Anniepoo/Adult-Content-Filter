You may access or request access to information concerning you in order to have it modified, deleted or to forbid any further use of it by us in the dedicated "My Account" section of DatingDirect.com or by using the contact details provided in the Terms of Use. Some information, comments or content (e.g. photographs, video, profile, lifestyle) that you optionally provide may possibly, under your own responsibility and on your own initiative, reveal your ethnic origin, nationality, religion and/or sexual orientation. By providing such optional information, you confirm your intention and, consequently, expressly consent to, and take sole responsibility for, the processing of this mentioned "sensitive" data by us and our group companies, and their service providers located within and outside of the European Union.

We are a member of the Online Dating Association (ODA) which was set up to ensure high standards of behaviour by dating service providers serving the UK. The ODA Code of Practice is binding on members of the Association.
As an ODA Member we are required to have appropriate and effective arrangements in place for dealing with complaints and enquiries.
The ODA provides general information on common enquiries users have about dating services but will not deal directly with individual complaints which are properly the responsibility of member companies. The ODA monitors enquiry and complaint levels and the issues complained about. It can intervene if it sees worrying trends or serious matters of concern.
Further information about ODA can be found here.
