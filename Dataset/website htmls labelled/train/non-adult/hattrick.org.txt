Managers from 128 countries (1/5)
Hattrick is a global game with a strong local presence. Currently the game is available in 128 different countries and the game is translated into over 50 languages - more than any other.
It takes strategy to win (2/5)
Let us be honest, it isn't easy to be a successful manager in Hattrick and it certainly doesn't happen overnight. Hattrick is a strategic manager game where you need to plan a long term strategy balancing the finances of your club and your team's performance on the pitch. You must constantly evaluate your strategy along the way and always be prepared to change to your plan B if you don't achieve the results you aimed for.
Easy to get started (3/5)
It's easy to get started playing Hattrick. Once you have signed up for your team you will be placed in a pre-season tournament lasting for 48 hours preparing you for playing against the more experienced managers. Keep in mind that many of our current 500,000 managers have been playing for 5 years or more so we want you to be prepared before throwing you into the ring.
No pay to win features (4/5)
In contrast to most online football manager games available, it is NOT possible to buy yourself an easy way through the Hattrick league system. You cannot pay to get your injured star striker healed faster and you cannot pay to get an energy boost for that important game. We want the smartest manager with the best strategy to succeed and not the one with the biggest wallet.
Large active football community (5/5)
An important part of playing Hattrick is the large active football community. This community creates a forum post every other second, around the clock. Whatever question you might have, there are always many experienced managers ready to help you out!
