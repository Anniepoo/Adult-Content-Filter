Valor Elite BJJ Blue Belt
Model: elite-belt-blue
£15.00																														Ex Tax: £15.00
Valor Elite BJJ Blue Belt
The Elite belts are in our opinion the best belt available. They are made from our own blend of GI material which makes them a lot more durable than a standard belt. They are also thicker and heavier and they have a great feel to them.
Belt Lengths:
A1: 275cmA2:  282cmA3:  293cmA4:  308cm
Tip: Remember that these belts are made from GI material so if wash then wash cold to minimize shrinkage. If you want to shrink to fit order a size bigger than you normally do.
