Your interest rate and annual percentage yield may change. At our discretion, we may change the interest rate on your account daily. Interest begins to accrue on the day after you deposit non-cash items (for example, checks). Interest is compounded monthly and is credited monthly on the last day of your statement cycle. If you close your account, you will be credited with interest earned since the beginning of the cycle until the date you close the account. We use the daily balance method to calculate the interest on your account. This method applies a daily periodic rate to the principal in the account each day. You may make no more than six (6) preauthorized withdrawals, automatic or telephone transfers, checks, drafts and debit card or similar transactions from your account per month or statement cycle. The minimum balance of this account is $2,500. If the balance in the account is below $2,500 on any day, the interest rate paid on this account will revert to that of our NOW account for the period of time the daily balance is below $2,500. If the daily balance falls below $1,000, the account will be subject to the fees charged on NOW accounts.
