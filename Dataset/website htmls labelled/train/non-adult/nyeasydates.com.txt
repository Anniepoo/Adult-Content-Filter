Customer Testimonials
Welcome to New York City's easiest, most enjoyable way to meet other singles - speed dating with New York EasyDates. In one short evening, have ten, twenty, or forty short, flirty "dates" with other eligible, professional NYC singles.
Choose the event that suits you: ten six-minute dates, up to twenty three-minute dates, or a speed-dating marathon of up to forty shorter dates.  After the event, decide who you want to see again.
The next day you'll check the website to get the contact information for your matches, and you take it from there.
So why waste time with internet dating or blind dates?
Know you like each other before you go out.
