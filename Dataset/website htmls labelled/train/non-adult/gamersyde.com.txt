Almost two years after its PC release, The Banner Saga has finally found its way to our consoles. As you probably know, the game received a very warm welcome at the time and it was only fair considering how interesting the gameplay mechanics and the story itself were. If you like strategy and if you like to influence the main plot with your choices, then look no further. From what we've seen, the controls have been well adapted to work perfectly with a controller, so make sure to check out our videos to see if the genre has a chance to appeal to you. Our only grudge with the game so far is that loading times are a bit too long and frequent. With the upcoming release of Invisible Inc. on PS4, it's great to see that strategy games are not only for PC gamers anymore.
