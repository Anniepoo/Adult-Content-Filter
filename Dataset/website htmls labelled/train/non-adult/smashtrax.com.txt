The Talking Baby: Simple Tricks And Techniques To Encourage Your Baby To Speak Sooner Book - Welcome
Being a parent can be one of the most amazing and wonderful adventures a person can experience.
But it’s not always easy.
Sometimes the hardest part of being a new parent is not knowing what your little bundle wants or is trying to tell you.
At this very moment, millions of moms and dads across the globe stare blankly at their screaming baby thinking, “What does this child want?
Pleeeease, just tell me!”
And while the initial months will most likely be challenging due to a lack of communication, the constant searching for what your baby desires does not need to last long.

This book contains all of our research, studies, experiments, training and education simplified into an easy-to-follow guide to help your child communicate.
As well, the techniques within can be used to help bring children up to speed who may be taking longer than normal to begin speaking.
