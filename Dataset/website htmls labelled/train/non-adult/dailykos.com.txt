Oklahoma Democrat J.J. Dossett
Oklahoma Democrat J.J. Dossett
Leading Off:
● Special Elections: Blue lightning has struck twice out on the Great Plains: On Tuesday night, Democrat J.J. Dossett won a special election for the state Senate in Oklahoma by a healthy 56-44 margin, picking up a Republican-held seat in the Tulsa area that Mitt Romney carried with an astounding 70 percent of the vote. What makes this even more amazing is that just a few months ago, Democrat Cyndi Munson also wrested a dark red legislative seat from the GOP in the Oklahoma City suburbs, giving Democrats two victories in districts they should never have been competitive in on paper.
But fortunately, elections aren't run on paper—they're run in real life, and Democrats had some advantages heading into this race. A special election became necessary when Republican state Sen. Rick Brinkley pled guilty last summer to charges that he'd embezzled $1.8 million from his employer, a local branch of the Better Business Bureau, in order to feed a gambling addiction. Whether or not that ugliness cast a pall over Republicans, we do know that Democrats wound up with the abler candidate.
Dossett, a school teacher and Afghanistan vet, happened to be the son of Rick Dossett, a popular high school principal whose well-regarded reputation helped extend a measure of name recognition to his son. Dossett's background as a teacher allowed him to focus his campaign heavily on education, an ideal topic for a Democrat running on Republican turf. And like his father before him, Dossett also coaches his school's boys' basketball team—a sport that's close to a religion in many communities. He even cancelled his election night watch party to coach a game!

Ted Cruz's loan from Goldman Sachs was a bullish bet on the Obama economy

Ted Cruz speaks at the Republican National Convention in 2012
Ted Cruz speaks at the Republican National Convention in 2012
Ted Cruz is already taking serious flak for failing to disclose a six-figure loan from investment bank Goldman Sachs that he used to buttress his out-gunned—but ultimately successful—bid for Senate in 2012. Under federal law, Cruz was required to report the loan on his public filings with the Federal Elections Commission, raising questions as to whether he hoped to conceal the fact that he was leaning on a notorious financial industry behemoth to prop up his campaign at the very same time he was excoriating the Wall Street bailout.
Cruz will have to face those questions, like it or not, but the New York Times report that brought this story to life also contained another interesting detail that again makes Cruz look like a hypocrite and a phony. Specifically, the article mentions that the Goldman loan was a so-called “margin loan,” which was secured by Cruz’s brokerage account. Usually, notes reporter Mike McIntire, margin loans are used to purchase stocks, but they don’t have to be, and so Cruz used the proceeds to support his campaign.
But here’s the thing about margin loans: They’re always subject to the dreaded “margin call.” Since the loan is backed up by the investments you own, if your portfolio drops below a certain value, your broker can demand you top up your account with more cash—or it can force you to sell your stocks, at a loss of course.
This is a risk every investor who “buys on margin” takes: If the stock market crashes, you’re going to take a beating when that margin call comes in. Unless you’ve taken a contrarian bet, you’re rooting for peace, prosperity, and a bull market when you're buying on margin—or campaigning on margin.
But wait a minute … does that sound anything like Ted Cruz? Would a raging tea partier who’s convinced Barack Obama is doing everything he can to destroy the economy actually place his faith in the market not tanking when he’s got up to half a million bucks riding on the forbearance of the kindly vampire squids at Goldman Sachs?
Yet that appears to be exactly what Cruz did. It’s unlikely he’d been gambling on a collapse in stocks, since the broader markets posted big gains in 2012, but, according to the Times, Cruz was able to pay down his loans by the end of the year. Had he lost a lot of money betting the wrong way, he probably wouldn’t have been able to repay those loans so quickly.
But if that’s indeed the case, then why wasn't he anticipating a major downturn? Why didn’t he put his money where his mouth was—literally? In a speech that same year at the Republican National convention, Cruz declared that President Obama's “economic agenda is perilous indeed”; that the nation was “going broke” and at risk of following “the path of Greece”; and that “the road of the Obama Democrats” would only mean “more and more spending, debt and government control of the economy.”
If you actually believed these kinds of things, you’d follow the advice of Ron Paul and put all your money in gold. You’d also have seen your life savings take an absolute beating lo these past many years, but that doesn’t seem to be what happened to Cruz. From all appearances, at the very same time as he was trashing the Obama economy, he was also prospering from it.
Whenever we attempt to penetrate the conservative mind, we always find ourselves asking whether they truly believe the nonsense they spout, or whether they know they’re full of it. With Ted Cruz, it looks like we just got an answer. Of course, we don't know for sure—but would you bet against it?

Today, we’ll take another crack at speaking with Monte Frank of Team 26, Internet Tubes willing. We were hoping to have him on hand for his reaction to the State of the Union address, and of course, the State of the Union address having come first in time, that is still entirely possible. What happy news! But in addition to that, and still more timely, Monte’s got a piece in today’s edition of The Hill which we’ll be able to review.
Have you ever known such exquisite skill in timing?
Listen LIVE right here at 9:00 AM ET!
Kagro in the Morning show podcasts are also available through iTunes.
SUPPORT SERIOUSLY GOOD MEDIA!
Hey, we put on a pretty good show, if I do say so myself, and we do it five days a week for two hours a day. I think we provide a product that's pretty unique in the radio and podcasting sphere, and we go into stories at a level of detail that's hard to find elsewhere, even right here at Daily Kos. "We'll have to leave it there," is something you'll never hear. Does that sound like media you'd like to help support? OK, well, would you do it anyway? If the Kagro in the Morning show is a fun, important or medically necessary part of your day, consider adding your ongoing support for what we do, through my Recurrency.us page.

David Waldman is back on line and back on the air! Ten U.S. sailors detained by Iran, have been freed! Great news, unless you hate America and missed your opportunity to needle the President. Conservatives attack Nikki Haley instead. Greg Dworkin brings us the latest polls and news — the race is tight in IA and NH, and Bernie Sanders is doing great, but so is Hillary Clinton. Either way, Bernie has made an impact which may be good news for Hillary as well. Two political reporters switched beats for a week, demonstrating what new can be seen with fresh eyes. Some may think Trump’s winning, but his primary competition doesn’t, so maybe that’s why they aren’t attacking him. Ted Cruz does not really deserve to be liked. So, right when he could use a hand, he is not finding many friends. Mitch McConnell says he’s on his own. Joan McCarter brings us news of the SOTU. Paul Ryan won his staring contest with someone, maybe it was the Little Sisters he brought in to make his political point. Nikki Haley did OK, although maybe not the best choice for conservatives. Senate Republicans may appease the House Republicans with limited filibuster reform. Lobbying outfit Heritage Action calls for an end to judicial confirmations during Obama’s final year. David reviews the gunFAILs of the new year and the in-school gunFails, along with the story of the security guard leaving a gun in a restroom. Virginia Delegate Mark Cole, phone and email, and Twitter, has filed a bill to require that children’s anatomical sex be verified before they use a restroom. Virginia Delegate Mark Cole either has not thought his bill out very well, or has thought it out all too well.

From the GREAT STATE OF MAINE…
Frozen Toes? Think Summer!
After missing last year's raucous event in Phoenix, I'm looking forward to leaving streaks of flame behind me as I hoverboard from Portland to St. Louis in July for the 2016 Netroots Nation convention, pub quiz and bar crawl. As always, C&J will be your #1 source here at DKos for info on NN16 and our host city in the run-up to it. To that end, executive director Raven Brooks has some big news about this year's sessions:
As always, we’ll be turning to the community to develop, organize and plan the sessions you’ll attend at Netroots Nation. But this year, we’re changing our process so the community has a more direct voice in what gets chosen.
Our home away from home July 14-17.
When the submission portal opens at the end of the month, submissions will be made public as they’re submitted, and you’ll have a chance to vote on which proposals you like best. The top 10 panels and top 4 trainings will automatically get a spot (provided that they meet our diversity and content guidelines).
This new public voting feature will give us better feedback on what topics are most important to you. Plus, it will give you as a potential session organizer a chance to see what’s being proposed and what hasn’t yet been submitted.
You can read more about the new session selection process here. Registration info for the July 14-17 event is here. Just saying July makes me feel warmer already.
Cheers and Jeers starts below the fold... [Swoosh!!] RIGHTNOW! [Gong!!]

Peter Baker:
Over the course of 48 hours, Americans will confront two starkly disparate views of Barack Obama’s America that will frame the debate over the future of the country in this election year and beyond.
The country described by the president on Tuesday night in his final State of the Union address is the most powerful nation on earth and on the rise again, with more jobs, better health care and stunning innovation. Although grappling with serious challenges, it is poised for greater progress.
By contrast, the country that Republican presidential candidates will depict on Thursday night in their next nationally televised debate is a darker place, a once-great power that has lost ground in a dangerous world, surrendered its authority and leadership with allies and enemies alike, and diminished freedom and opportunity at home.
Ezra Klein:
This is what makes Republicans and Democrats so different
Democratic presidents talk more about policy, propose more specific policy ideas, and pass more significant pieces of legislation. The numbers are stark. Since 1945, Democratic presidents have put forward 39 percent more policy proposals than Republican presidents, and 62 percent more domestic policy proposals.
"There is a good reason for this asymmetry," write Grossmann and Hopkins. "Democrats and liberals are more likely to focus on policymaking because any change that occurs is much more likely to be liberal than conservative. New policies usually expand the scope of government responsibility, funding, or regulation. There are occasional conservative policy successes as well, but they are less frequent and are usually accompanied by expansion of government responsibility in other areas."
This piece goes nicely with the Yuval Levin piece I linked yesterday: some respond positively to Trump’s diagnosis, some react negatively to his lack of solutions. People react differently to the same information.

The Washington Post:
Officials in Virginia’s largest jurisdiction want to close public schools during the Super Tuesday presidential primaries, saying they fear that supporters of Republican front-runner Donald Trump could cause mayhem at the polls.
At issue is a primary day obligation to "affirm" your Republican Party membership before casting a ballot in that party's primary. Republican advocates frame the rule as an attempt to keep voters from the opposing party from meddling in Republican affairs, but Trump opposes it in the belief that voters who are fed up with the Republican Party, i.e. the sort of voters who might be attracted to Donald Trump, would balk at having to declare their loyalty to a party they have come to despise.
[Fairfax County Electoral Board Secretary Katherine K. Hanley] said she believes the risk of arguments or fights over the pledge is significant enough to justify canceling classes for the county’s more than 180,000 students. [...]
In neighboring Loudoun County, General Registrar Judy Brown said well-publicized incidents of scuffling and name calling at Trump rallies across the country have sparked fear among some primary-day volunteers.
“We have had people saying they would prefer not to work the election,” Brown said.
Fairfax County supervisors voted 9 to 1 to ask the county’s schools to cancel classes for the day.
Welcome to 2016, everybody.

BLAST FROM THE PAST
At Daily Kos on this date in 2007—The Real Maverick in the Presidential Race:
By now, John McCain’s identity as a "maverick" has been pretty well demolished among thinking people, though it retains a tenacious grip on certain sectors of the media.  In light of McCain’s support for overturning Roe v. Wade, his cave on torture, his hiring of significant numbers of Bush-Cheney staffers, his turn to Bush’s big donors, and, of course, the McCain doctrine of Iraq war escalation, you’d think that it would be the joke among journalists it is among bloggers, but what can I say?  I guess they’re slow.
Those journalists so desperate for a maverick presidential candidate, though, should take a look at former Alaska Senator Mike Gravel (pronounced Gra-VEL), a long-shot Democratic candidate for president.  Like McCain, if elected, Gravel would be the oldest president.  Like McCain, Gravel’s major political experience is in the US Senate (1969-1981).  Gravel also is a veteran, having served in the Army in the Counter Intelligence Corps in the early 1950s.  And just as McCain's initial reputation was made on an act of Vietnam-era courage – refusing to be released from POW status early – in his past, so was Gravel's – entering the Pentagon Papers into the public record via his Senate subcommittee on Buildings and Grounds, and filibustering the renewal of the draft.  But unlike McCain, Gravel is genuinely a maverick, with the good and the bad that comes with that status.
On today’s Kagro in the Morning show, Greg Dworkin & Joan McCarter join to wrap up last night’s SOTU & response. Sailorghazi, we hardly knew ye! Everybody hates Ted Cruz, and with good reason. VA Gop lawmakers now want in to your kids’ underpants. Net neutrality threatened, again.

Amazing sleuthing: Watch the dancing part in this Republican senator's hair unmask him as a phony

Bizarro Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby
Bizarro Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby
Alabama Republican Sen. Richard Shelby spent $6 million on a new 60-second campaign ad during last month’s Cotton Bowl game, but it turns out he should have splurged a bit more on a continuity editor. Shelby’s spot promoted him as a conservative who’s always found time to visit his home state, with the narrator praising the senator as someone who “knows the back roads, the quickest routes.” We see plenty of shots of Shelby’s car driving across scenic Alabama, and there's even a moment where, sitting in the front seat, he gazes out the windshield. The message is clear: Shelby is a regular guy who hasn’t gone Washington.
The only problem with that message? His hair.
Kyle Whitmire of AL.com has some incredibly keen readers, and they’ve pointed out that the part in Shelby’s hair clearly changes sides between shots. When the senator steps out of what appears to be the driver’s side of his vehicle, the part is on right side of his head. However, in other segments of the ad where Shelby is interacting with people, it’s on the left side. “How?!?” you’re asking. Well, the mystery of the traveling hair is solved when the shot of Shelby leaving his car—shown at the top of this post—is reversed:
While the ad wants the viewer to think the senator drives himself from one end of the Yellowhamer State to the other, the flipped screenshot shows that Shelby is actually disembarking from the passenger side. In other words, someone else did all the driving, and the shot of Shelby exiting the passenger side is reversed so it looks like he was getting out of the driver’s seat instead. And amazingly, the ad's director didn’t even bother to recreate the scene by having Shelby re-enter and exit from the driver’s side once the car was parked. Now that's lazy.
For a longtime Republican incumbent eager to project authenticity in the face of a primary challenge, there’s almost nothing worse then being exposed as a phony. And Shelby would have gotten away with it too, if it weren't for that meddling part!

Big Brother is having a field day in Fresno with scary surveillance technology

You can file this one under: “What in the fuckety fuck?”
Surveillance in the U.S. may be entering a new high in terms of technological advances, while simultaneously hitting a new low in terms of privacy and other matters. And it appears that Fresno, California, is leading the way. You remember Fresno. It seems that the whole truth is just now being told in terms of how deeply committed to channeling Orwell’s Big Brother this town is.
Fresno’s police department is now using technology to assess the threat levels of its residents. Utilizing software that analyzes a variety of data, including social media postings, a threat level can be assigned pretty much the same way a credit score is assigned.
Fresno police swear by their system. It’s housed in a control room that brings to mind the one that Batman (Christian Bale) put Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) in charge of in an effort to key in on The Joker (Heath Ledger) in The Dark Knight. Oh yeah … it’s that kind of party. According to the Washington Post:
“On 57 monitors that cover the walls of the center, operators zoomed and panned an array of roughly 200 police cameras perched across the city. They could dial up 800 more feeds from the city’s schools and traffic cameras, and they soon hope to add 400 more streams from cameras worn on officers’ bodies and from thousands from local businesses that have surveillance systems.”
“The cameras were only one tool at the ready. Officers could trawl a private database that has recorded more than 2 billion scans of vehicle licenses plates and locations nationwide. If gunshots were fired, a system called ShotSpotter could triangulate the location using microphones strung around the city. Another program, called Media Sonar, crawled social media looking for illicit activity. Police used it to monitor individuals, threats to schools and hashtags related to gangs.”
What in the fuckety fuck? My bad—I said that already, didn’t I?
The threat-scoring software that makes sense of all this information is called Beware. So what, exactly, does it do?

Democrat J.J. Dossett (at right)
Blue lightning has struck twice out on the Great Plains: On Tuesday night, Democrat J.J. Dossett won a special election for the state Senate in Oklahoma by a healthy 56-44 margin, picking up a Republican-held seat in the Tulsa area that Mitt Romney carried with an astounding 70 percent of the vote. What makes this even more amazing is that just a few months ago, Democrat Cyndi Munson also wrested a dark red legislative seat from the GOP in the Oklahoma City suburbs, giving Democrats two victories in districts they should never have been competitive in on paper.
But fortunately, elections aren't run on paper—they’re run in real life, and Democrats had some advantages heading into this race. A special election became necessary when Republican state Sen. Rick Brinkley pled guilty last summer to charges that he’d embezzled $1.8 million from his employer, a local branch of the Better Business Bureau, in order to feed a gambling addiction. Whether or not that ugliness cast a pall over Republicans, we do know that Democrats wound up with the abler candidate.
Dossett, a school teacher and Afghanistan vet, happened to be the son of Rick Dossett, a popular high school principal whose well-regarded reputation helped extend a measure of name recognition to his son. Dossett’s background as a teacher allowed him to focus his campaign heavily on education, an ideal topic for a Democrat running on Republican turf. And like his father before him, Dossett also coaches his school’s boys’ basketball team—a sport that’s close to a religion in many communities. He even cancelled his election night watch party to coach a game!
Republican businessman and pastor David McLain, meanwhile, emerged from a rough GOP primary that "left some sore feelings,” according to the Tulsa World, and was not as well-known. He campaigned on typical conservative themes, but sometimes “small government” isn’t a winning message for folks tired of cuts to education funding. McLain also seemed to avoid the media—more than one article on the race (such as this one and this one) reported that McLain would not respond to interview requests. In a low-turnout special election against a better-known opponent, hiding from the public can be deadly.
And indeed, it appears to have been so for McLain, a recipe that allowed Dossett to win this seat for Democrats for the first time since 1990, despite getting outspent. The party is still deep in the minority in the state Senate, though, with just nine members (including Dossett) compared to 39 for Republicans. But Dossett's huge upset, like Munson’s, shows what can happen when one side takes victory for granted, and it should inspire Democrats facing long odds everywhere.

Woman sues Walmart after being told to 'choose between her career and her kids,' then fired

Women filing discrimination lawsuits against Walmart are nothing new. Walmart firing people for questionable and controversial reasons is also nothing new. Now a woman is suing the low-wage retail giant, saying she was fired after complaining about discriminatory treatment. Specifically, Rebecca Wolfinger says her boss told her she had to “choose between her career and her kids.”
Wolfinger's suit focuses on what she claims was her mistreatment while working as a shift manager. She was being required to work seven days a week when she received the "career or kids" threat, she contends.
Other male shift managers weren't on a seven-day work schedule, Wolfinger claims. Her February 2012 firing occurred after she reported her boss' comment to a company human resource officer, the suit states.
Wolfinger was officially fired, she says, for selling Pampered Chef outside of work—but coworkers who engaged in similar activities weren’t fired. And of course a sophisticated company like Walmart doesn’t admit to having fired someone for complaining about illegal discrimination.
Several years ago, 1.5 million women who worked or had worked at Walmart attempted a class action lawsuit against the company, only to have the Supreme Court say that “[e]ven if every single one of these accounts is true, that would not demonstrate that the entire company operate[s] under a general policy of discrimination.” That’s despite evidence like this:
Many female Walmart employees have been paid less than male coworkers. In 2001, female workers earned $5,200 less per year on average than male workers. The company paid those who had hourly jobs, where the average yearly earnings were $18,000, $1.16 less per hour ($1,100 less per year) than men in the same position. Female employees who held salaried positions with average yearly earnings of $50,000 were paid $14,500 less per year than men in the same position. Despite this gap in wages, female Walmart employees on average have longer tenure and higher performance ratings.
Doubtless all just a coincidence, though. Just like Rebecca Wolfinger was coincidentally fired for something that other workers did after she reported being discriminated against.

Meet Y'All Qaeda's newest member—David Fry
Meet Y'All Qaeda's newest member—David Fry
The Ammon Bundy-led militia currently occupying the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon has a new member with computer skills. Meet David Fry—a lawbreaker with a penchant for social media and a special love of Nazis and ISIS. He drove cross country from Ohio, through blinding snow, to join the band of soon-to-be felons.
More on David Fry from Oregon Public Radio:
Fry’s Google+ account shows the Ohio man regularly posts anti-Semitic, homophobic, and pro-Nazi propaganda on social media.
“ALL I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS IS FOR ISIS TO NUKE ISRAELHELL!” he wrote on the site Nov. 30.
When asked to explain his feelings about Israel and ISIS, Fry spoke at length of government conspiracies, plots against multiple countries, Sept. 11, court records, computer viruses on Japanese computers, Fukushima and a Jewish conspiracy against the free world that involves causing nuclear meltdowns.
He sounds nice, right? Fry also used the federal government’s computer to create a website where you can follow the antics of the Oregon standoff and even purchase the post-apocalyptic novel by Oregon occupier LaVoy Finicum. It’s entitled Only By Blood and Suffering and the Amazon reviews really sell it:
This "book" is a huge pile of crap. It is Junior High level writing at best, written by an unimaginative and craftless mind. I knew I was in trouble by the 2nd paragraph when you are shown the intra-apocalyptic view of Albuquerque, but by page two the "author" revealed I had already wasted too much time. Here is a sample:
“Mom, Mom,” I spoke softly into the night as the first flakes of a winter storm began to fall. “Why did you trust the politicians and turn in your gun? How could you ever believe the government would keep you safe?”
You got it. This was written by a gun nut for other gun nuts only. You could not show your writing students a better example of trite and derivative. I have no more on this. I've wasted too much time here already.
