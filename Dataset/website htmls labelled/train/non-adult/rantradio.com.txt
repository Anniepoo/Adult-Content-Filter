Welcome to southeast Arkansas’ and northeast Louisiana’s source for beekeeping supplies and knowledge.
We are glad you stopped by, and hope that you will find everything you need to help your hives grow and prosper.
We are always in the process of updating our site and adding more tools, supplies and lots of information to help those who are new to the hobby of beekeeping, as well as those who have been involved in beekeeping for years.
If you are new to beekeeping, please be sure to visit our Learning Center. We have several items you may find to be helpful in getting started. We are adding a section where you can ask questions about beekeeping, and we will help you get connected to someone who has the answer for your question or even help you find a mentor in many cases.
Those with more experience will appreciate the selection of tools, boxes and more we have available whether you are looking to expand your hives, or you are wanting to upgrade your equipment.
For the professional, we have commercial grade equipment available either by special order if needed, or in stock for immediate delivery.
Speaking of delivery, we will deliver your order within a 50 mile radius of our store for a small mileage fee. We are also looking into online sales of some of our most popular items.
So, again, we really look forward to serving you here at Apiary Beekeeping Supplies. We pride ourselves on personal service, and are just waiting to show you the best southeast Arkansas has to offer for the beekeeper — novice or professional.
Come back often, as our inventory does change often. When new items are added, our catalog and our site are usually updated within 24 hours of arrival.
Enjoy your visit, and come back often!

Have you seen a swarm of honeybees on your property?
If so, please follow these simple precautions:
If a swarm has settled on your property, you should keep children and pets inside the house until the flying bees have clustered. Usually they will all cluster on a bush or other object. Once they do, many of the bees will stop flying and it should be safe to venture outside but continue to keep children and animals away from the swarm. Wear shoes to protect your feet in case bees have settled on the ground. Africanized bees have not been found in this area, in fact there has not been a positive find of an Africanized colony in Arkansas since 2007. However, please use caution any time you approach a swarm in the wild … just to be safe. Do not attempt to move the swarm by hosing it, poking it, throwing stones at it, smoking the bees or taking any action to make the swarm move. This action will only aggravate the bees and encourage them to sting in self defense. Interfering with the swarm will make it more difficult for a beekeeper or licensed pest control operator to deal with the bees.If you live in southeast Arkansas or northeast Louisiana, you can call Apiary Beekeeping Supplies at 870-305-1125 during business hours.
We will help you find a beekeeper near you who can remove the swarm. After hours and weekends, call 870-500-6774.
This information was compiled from several sources, but is not all inclusive. Please be careful around swarms.
