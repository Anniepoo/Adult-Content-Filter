David Stillman
Hello! I'm David, that's a photo of me up there on the ladder. I write code in Boulder, CO.
I also take photographs and write words. Have a look at the long-form stories I've been writing, or dig deep into the archives of my blog, which I maintained for the first decade of this century. If you just want to read two posts, check out my first high altitude balloon payload and the time I almost got caught sneaking into a decommissioned nuclear missile silo. If you're interested in weather balloons, check out my HAB FAQ or just watch a video of one of my payloads ascending to 110,000 feet.
I hang out online a lot. The best places to see what I've been up to lately are my flickr and twitter streams. If you want to have a look at what's been hitting my ears recently have a gander at my rdio profile. If you're really hip, you can follow me on ello.
If you want to give me a job, ask me a question about something geeky or otherwise get in touch, send an email to me@stilldavid.com; it's most certainly the best way to get a hold of me.
