Vision247 is uniquely positioned to provide broadcasters, TV channels and content owners a complete end-to-end set of services to allow them to manage, distribute and monetise content via, not only traditional DVB platforms, but also the disruptive new world of IPTV and OTT delivery.
Vision247 Offers a Full Range of Broadcast Services
Channel Launch
Vision247 can provide a range of services that enable you to start and run a TV channel, satellite or IP, in a timely and cost effective manner. We can help at every stage of the project, from consultancy at planning right through to launch day and beyond.
Channel Playout Services
Our flexible, secure and resilient Playout Centre ensures that your content is delivered to its respective publishing points, at the right time, in the right format. Our extensive knowledge of playout and launching channels ensures that your channel has the greatest chance of success, both technically and commercially.
Channel Downlink and Distribution
Vision247 is your ideal partner to downlink channels using its extensive satellite dish farm and distribute your TV channel via satellite, cable, OTT or connected Freeview.
Data Centre
Vision247’s data storage London offers customers highly affordable and effective RAID data storage in London and backup services with flexible and fast access via private fibre and/or secure Tier-1 public internet access.
Connected Freeview
Rather than spend £millions on bandwidth across the DTT network, we can deliver your channel on connected Freeview at a fraction of the cost – via IP. No additional software or hardware required by the viewer.
OTT/Multiscreen
With our online video platform, you can deliver high quality online video to anyone on any connected device around the world. Xtreme Player enables you to broadcast your content however you’d like.
