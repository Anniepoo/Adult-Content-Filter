Introduction
This site is about the world of toxygen, a pseudonym I'm using
since the early 1990s to sign most of my (art) work. Despite the
fact, that toxygen originates from the composition of the words
toxic and oxygen, it has no special meaning except
for its unique sound. Have a look around and take some time. Enjoy!

WorldDB Digital Atlas
What started as a personal travelling tool eventually became an extensive, interactive Digital Atlas of the World: Millions of unique points, vector
layers and raster data mixed with real-time data - the world at your fingertip. Doesn't matter whether you're interested in geography or just want to explore what's around you - have a look!

Some software I've written. Please note, that the use of this
software is at your own risk and restricted to private, noncommercial

TChess
is a stylish front-end for playing chess games. It supports
WinBoard
compatible chess engines, playing over the Internet (with real-time
chat and speech), engine battles, game import/export (PGN & FEN
format) and more. Many skins from classic to ultra fancy are included.
Runs on any Windows System supporting DirectX 7 or better.
DOoRS
is an operating system
developed from the scratch. It runs on most i386 based PC systems with
a
VESA compatible graphic card and at least 16MB of RAM. It supports
floppy, harddisk & CD-ROM drives and up to 32
processor cores. Some demo applications, a Tetris clone and
a Mandelbrot renderer, are included as well. See the DOoRS readme
file for more details. Download the ISO
image,
burn it on a CD-ROM and boot your computer to see for yourself.
