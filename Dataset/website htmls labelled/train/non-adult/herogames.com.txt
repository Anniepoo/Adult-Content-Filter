Strike Force Designer Diary Three: Michael Surb...
Jan 12 2016 11:47 PM |
in HERO System News
In my previous Designer Diary I spoke about the sheer size of the files I had been tasked to sort and read through. Now I want to talk about the sheer size of Aaron’s universe—and it was a full universe.Initially, when Aaron started running, there was just Earth. But that quickly changed, as Phosphene, Denis Loubet’s PC, was descended from travelers from another dimension. Aaron also had two PCs who were aliens, which meant he needed to start detailing what outer space was like. And as the campaign continued, the size and scope of the universe expanded. It soon came to resemble (in my opinion) the DC Comics universe, with multiple alternate Earths. (See more below the fold!)

Strike Force Designer Diary Two: Ross Watson Sp...

in HERO System News
In 1989, I found myself admiring an RPG I had never seen before. It was what I like to call “the big blue book.” The title splashed across an awesome George Perez cover art said: Champions. It was the 4th edition of the game, and it captured me like few other games ever had. Little did I know that one of the supplements for this game, published one year earlier, would change the way I played RPGs forever.That supplement was called Strike Force, and it was penned by a man I came to know as a friend and a very talented, creative writer: Aaron Allston. Strike Force was not just a setting book, or an enemies book, or a GM’s book. It was all three, and yet it was also something more than the sum of its parts. Strike Force was the first book that ever taught me what it was like to run a long-term RPG campaign, to seize the superhero tropes and themes and make them fit into the experience of a role-playing game. Strike Force was the first time I was taught that different players want different things out of a gaming experience – common knowledge these days, but a revelation back then. (More below the fold!)

It’s one thing to hear a campaign has been run for twenty years; it’s another thing to see it. When I first received the files for Aaron Allston’s Strike Force campaign, I was astounded. I had been given a 600 MB zip file, which eventually unpacked itself into 872 MB and over 5,800 items. And once everything had been unpacked, I started to poke through this extensive collection of files….And what did I find? (Read more below the fold!)

Dec 09 2015 12:38 AM |
in Store Item News
Recent press release from Evil Beagle Games and High Rock Press! Featuring original and new material by Aaron Allston (Star Wars Legacy of the Force and X-Wing series; the Doc Sidhe series; Dungeons & Dragons Mystara; numerous Champions and other RPG products), the Aaron Allston's Stike Force project is a revival of one of the greatest roleplaying products in the hobby’s history. Strike Force was originally published in 1988 as part of the Champions line of superhero roleplaying products. While it’s primary purpose was to present Aaron’s rather well-known and popular home campaign (which was renowned for the waiting list of folks – including many gaming luminaries – wanting to join) for use by otherChampions game masters, the real glory of this book was its function as an amazing guide on how to run a campaign – not just for superheroes, but just about any RPG.
