About me
I work on energy efficient technologies, I grew up in the east coast of Canada and I expect big things from 2015.
My life philosophy was shaped by my grad school days when I earned a Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering from Queen's University where I worked at the Queen's-RMC Fuel Cell Research Center.
Some useful skills that I've picked up over the years and try to fine tune: (i) learning how to fail (ii) useful mathematical modelling and programming abilities (aka algorithm development for real world processes) (iii) a diverse understanding of energy technologies (iv) public speaking (v) confidence in being able to work on initially overwhelming projects (vi) and general research related skills.
These are the areas of my expertise:
Other tidbits:
I created and hosted theWatt Podcast, where I spoke to many energy experts about energy topics. This was the first podcast to focus on energy topics. 1500 people listened to me each week. Sadly, this became too time consuming to continue.
When I lived in Kingston, I was involved with SWITCH Kingston (and I'm still a member).
When I think of it, I post energy-related stats to Twitter. A sampling of this is on the left.
I think the next big thing (as in iPhone big) is the Arduino (or at least products derived from its existence) and that there will be a resurgence in the social status of makers.
