Enjoy Blast on Your TV
A few weeks before releasing the new AppleTV to the public, Apple sent us a development unit. Then, after evaluating the input/control options we decided to port our beloved Blast. Since tvOS is very similar to iOS most of the game was already coded, the only work necessary was to adapt the remote input (trackpad and gyro), optional gamepad input, and rewrite the user interface to respond to these new input controls.The result is awesome. Playing Blast in a big-screen with big-sound improves the experience considerably. Using a gamepad instead of the remote is highly recommended.
