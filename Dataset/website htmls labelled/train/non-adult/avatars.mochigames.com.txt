"WELCOME young godling to the planes of AVATAR, where you will gain maturity and experience by driving frail bodies of avatars with a fragment of your essence.
If you are successful in your endeavours, you will finally graduate and win the right of all adult deities to join the Board of Director Deities.
On your quests, you will meet danger, love, challenge and fun, but do not be swayed from your path. Go forth, and grow to an adult's total omnipotence!"

Hi all,You won't be able to log into Avatar for a while - the machine it was running on toasted itself (windows messed it up). So, until the new machine is stable I won't make Avatar available to be played.I'll put another announcement up here when its back!

I have now disabled new account registrations.This has been done because:The amount of spam accounts being created was getting silly (20-30/day)No-one has logged into avatar for several weeks now (other than myself!).If you really need to create an account whilst registration is disabled, please feel free to send an e-mail to deity1query@avatar.co.uk and I'll re-enable registration for you to create an account.If I leave this off for a few weeks and then re-enable it, the spambots may well have gone away (some hope)! I'm currently considering using a question that needs a human to be there to answer - a bit like what I've done on my other site (http://www.angelicals.me.uk), but at the moment I'm having difficulty thinking of a generic question. It may be that I'll add the answer to Avatar itself, meaning you must have at least logged in to be able to get an answer to the registration question...If any of you are out there please reply to this poll!

Well ive just spent an enjoyable time reading some of these old posts, having being redirected to this site by Chris (Columbus) who contacted me recently.Sure was good remembering the old times (omg i sound like my mother!)So how is everyone? What you all doing?Im still in the same place working for a boring large company and waiting to win the lottery...Hannah is living in Southern Ireland and Marc is still at home (I never thought 10 years ago that in 2008 he would STILL be cramping my style).Must be time for a meet...
