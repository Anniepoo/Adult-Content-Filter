Gossip Girl Fashion
Finally—after a long, long summer, we get to find out if Blair is really marrying her prince and who is pregnant this time... Eh—who really cares? We gave up on the plot a few seasons ago and like everyone else, we're only watching for the clothes.
Now those fashions are easier to get and more affordable than ever. Romeo and Juliet Couture launched a line of Gossip Girl-inspired clothes and they're going on sale at HauteLook today at 40% off retail. After that, you'll find the looks at Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus and Kitson.
Check out the sale today, starting at 11 EST and be sure to watch Gossip Girl at 8 EST. We'll be tweeting along at JSGAnne. See you there!

On Our Radar: Thompson Takes Over Hotel Victor Miami
The Thompson Hotel group acquired Miami's Hotel Victor this week. A renovation will be finished early next year; but their management will take over immediately. If you've walked down Ocean Drive in the past decade, there's a good chance you've been to one of their parties at Hotel Victor. We sure have. The Art Deco hotel has 90 rooms most with ocean views and generous sized bathrooms and terraces. It also has a gorg infinity pool, 6,000 square foot spa, and multiple restaurants and lounges. We looked forward to seeing what Thompson can do to improve this already cool corner of South Beach.

Bobbi Brown Party to Go Palette
The Party to Go Palette is perfect for daily touchups, your gym bag, girls' night out, or your travel bag. Its three eye shadows, two lip colors and mini lipgloss are deeper shades that will transition to fall and winter well. Leave it to Bobbi to create another palette we just can't live without.
