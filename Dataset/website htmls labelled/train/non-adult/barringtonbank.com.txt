Welcome
Printer-friendly versionBarrington Bank & Trust is more than just a great bank. It is a true
community bank.  Some may ask why we need another bank.  Our response
is simple. See for yourself how banking should be.  With decisions made
locally and bank staff living in the community, Barrington Bank & Trust marks the return of real hometown banking to our area.Since we are a locally controlled and managed bank, we have the
unique ability to make decisions more quickly and provide more
customized services and products that truly benefit residents of the
area. We can pass the savings on to our customers because we don't have the big overhead of other banks. That's what hometown banking is really about--friendly service and great products--banking the way it ought to be. We hope you enjoy our website. Please feel free to call or e-mail
us with any questions or thoughts on how we might improve our site.
Thank you for visiting!
