PlayJam was established with a core mission to bring affordable gaming to TV. The company operates a built-for-TV games platform that currently powers casual games on over 80 million Smart TV devices worldwide through partnerships with leading manufacturers including, Samsung, LG, Sony, Western Digital and Panasonic. To date the platform has delivered over 1 billion games via Pay and Smart TV networks in over 120 countries. Learn more at www.playjam.com.
In January this year, PlayJam extended support for its platform to Android-enabled devices and announced the launch of its own hardware platform GameStick. At $79.99, GameStick - billed as the world's most portable TV games console - offers families an affordable entry point to a world of games that can be played on the home's big screen.
PlayJam is backed by GameStop, Adobe, Endeavour Ventures, London Venture Partners and a number of game industry luminaries.

Parents
GameStick is a family friendly console designed with parents in mind. We have therefore put in place a number of features designed to prevent unintentional purchases and access to inappropriate content.
Age ratings provide clear guidance on suitability of each game/app
Based on industry standards, all GameStick content carries an age rating. These rating are clearly marked on each game and app page.
Content filter ensures only suitable content is available to your children
The filter can easily be applied so that only games suitable for your child's age and maturity are made available. It is easy to switch the filter so that grown up games and apps are available once the children are in bed. We have made it easy to identify what level of filter has been applied. You can find the filter settings in the Parental Control section. The account password is required to change the settings.
All purchases are password protected
Every purchase requires the account password to complete the transaction.
The wallet avoids excessive spending
Credit can be added to the GameStick wallet via credit or debit cards and through vouchers bought in-store. Purchases are then made against the amount in the wallet, meaning that your children cannot run up excessive spending without your knowledge. Credit/debit cards are protected by a separate Payment PIN which is required when adding more credit to the wallet.
Complete account control via the web
You can manage all aspects of your account from the web, including parental controls and purchasing games which will download immediately the next time the GameStick is turned on.
