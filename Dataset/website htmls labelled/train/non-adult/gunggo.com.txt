HOW'S IT DONE?
The Brand Engagement Platform
GumGum is the leading in-image and in-screen advertising platform, driving brand engagement for advertisers and increased revenue for publishers across every screen. Our commitment to making brand advertising work better through technology and media drives higher viewability, relevance and brand engagement than standard display advertising.
We invented in-image advertising in 2008, and continue to lead the industry with our solution for helping publishers monetize their images and giving advertisers a relevant way to tell their brand stories through pictures. Our patented In-Image Ads are overlaid on editorial photos where a user's attention is actively focused, creating higher viewability and engagement, and a better consumer experience.

Today we are going beyond images, creating new ways to make an impact in-line with editorial content. Responsively designed to fit all screen sizes and resolutions, In-Screen Ads are audience-targeted and persistent as users scroll, increasing viewability and creating a high-impact brand experience.

GumGum reaches over 600 million unique visitors per month across billions of images on premium websites. In addition to giving publishers a new way to monetize their images while maintaining a relevant user experience, we give advertisers the ability to reach highly targeted audiences at scale in a brand-safe environment.
600MUnique Visitors/Mo.
Our vision is nothing short of reinventing advertising.
From our ownership of the in-image category to our relentless pursuit of new, disruptive display technologies, we're building a new kind of digital advertising company.
