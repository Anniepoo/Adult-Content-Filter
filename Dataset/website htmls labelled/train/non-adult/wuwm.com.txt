Some might look wistfully at a picture of urban decay in their hometown like the images photographer Eric Holubow has captured in Milwaukee.  However Lake Effect essayist Christianna Frtiz has given quite a lot of thought to her personal idea of home:

President Obama delivered what will be the final State of the Union address of his presidency Tuesday night before a joint session of Congress.  There was much build-up to the speech, both in the national media, but also from the White House itself, which advertised the address as diverging from how previous speeches to the nation have gone.

Have you filled up your car at the gas station recently?  Really, if you’ve filled up any time in the last few months, the trip feels like a walk down memory lane, at least when you pay the bill.  But Lake Effect essayist Avi Lank says gas prices need to be viewed in a larger context:

It was perhaps fitting that the most memorable passage of President Obama's final State of the Union speech should come near its end. After nearly an hour on the podium, Obama paused and slipped into a mode more suited to a pulpit. In the next few minutes, the president tried to address the state not of the American union but of American politics.

There were unpleasant moments on the Assembly floor Tuesday, when a Republican representative made an obscene gesture at Democratic leader Peter Barca. The initial irritant was a news release GOP Assemblyman Bob Gannon of Slinger issued last week, complaining about Milwaukee’s homicide rate and black unemployment. Democrats demanded an apology. Gannon apologized, but only for making what he called, an improper gesture in the heat of battle. Earlier in the day, members of both parties came together on several issues including four bills aimed at preventing heroin addiction.
Lipogramtically Yours: The Poems of Mark Zimmermann

Stoneboat Literary Journal
There are many different ways to write a poem, if you’re so inclined. There’s the sonnet. Or, if you lean towards the bawdy, there’s the limerick. Or if you’re wordy and think of yourself in ancient Greek terms, there’s the two-volume epic. But for Milwaukee poet Mark Zimmermann, the form that has captured his fancy for the last decade is the lipogram. It’s a form in which the poet chooses to omit certain letters – like writing a poem without the letter B, for example. Zimmermann took it one step further and wrote poems about people that used only the letters in their names.

Leaders of Oak Creek say the Milwaukee suburb is on the verge of a new beginning. The community is developing a main street and city center on land that once housed a massive Delphi plant.  When the plant closed its doors in 2008, Oak Creek was left with 85 available acres. Leaders eventually came to view it as a massive opportunity, according to Carolyn Esswein. She’s an urban planning professor at UW-Milwaukee, and served as the city's consultant.
