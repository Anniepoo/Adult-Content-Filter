Wyoming Bank and Trust’s mission is to provide outstanding personalized banking services to our customers in Wyoming and on the Internet. We believe that our strength lies in the principle that “what is best for the customer, is ultimately best for the Bank.”  Wyoming Bank & Trust has been providing home-town, personal service to its customers since 1919. We are a closely-held, locally owned Bank and don’t have to get approval from anyone but ourselves (within State and Federal regulations, of course). Our “One On One” personalized service is not a result of expensive corporate training or sensitivity training, just good ol’ western hospitality. Our people make the difference. We look forward to serving you!
