IMPORTANT CONSUMER AND NONCONSUMER ACCOUNT INFORMATION - US Dollar Cash Deposit Limitations Policy: Effective August 1, 2011, BBVA Compass will impose limitations on the amount of US dollar cash deposits by non-resident customers. Under this policy, if you are an individual who is not a US resident, the aggregate amount of US dollar cash deposits that may be made into your consumer account during any calendar month is limited to $4,000. If you are a foreign entity (i.e., the holder of a business, commercial or other account for nonconsumer purposes and not a US entity) the aggregate amount of US dollar cash deposits that may be made into your foreign entity business, commercial or other account for nonconsumer purposes during any calendar month is limited to $14,000. These limitations will not apply to deposits made by check or other non-cash deposits. At our discretion, we may at any time without prior written notice to you (except where prior notice is required by law) establish or change the aggregate US dollar cash deposit limit by posting the maximum US dollar limit in each of our banking centers. We reserve the right to refuse any US dollar cash deposit that exceeds, or would cause the aggregate of such deposits to exceed, our established aggregate US dollar cash deposit limitations.
