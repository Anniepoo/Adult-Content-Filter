Bloggers:  Jay Rosen e-mails:
...Start a "Why I Blog" section (Orwell:
"Why I Write") just for posts that
explain why an author started his or her weblog,
what drove them to do it.
"...we're
honored to be a repository."
"I
cannot say with certainty which of my motives are the
strongest,
but I know
which of them deserve to be followed."
George
Orwell: Why I Write, 1946
Why
do you Blog?
Send Your Thoughts (Essay): "Why
I Blog"
We'll post
the best of them on our "Why I Blog"
page with interesting "First Post" links.

other bloggers who then link-out to other bloggers, and so on, and so
on. "Pay it Forward" in the blogosphere.
