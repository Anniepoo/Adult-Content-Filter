Accountant jobs vary enormously, depending on your level of qualification and experience. You can enter as a graduate or trainee accountant with little or no formal qualifications or you can study for specific accountancy exams and take a fast-track to the top jobs.Finding admin work If you love organising and have great attention to detail, then you might just be perfect for one of the many admin jobs out there. Administration is not just about filing and diary management, however. You could be relied on by many to ensure the smooth running of a team or business, so you need to have lots of common sense, good interpersonal skills and heaps of energy and creativity. If you enjoy throwing parties, creating recipes, de-cluttering or spotting errors in others’ work, then you are probably going to make a great administrator!
