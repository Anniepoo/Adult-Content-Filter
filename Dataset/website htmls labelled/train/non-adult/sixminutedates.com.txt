Speed dating is quite simply an opportunity for you to meet other SINGLES your age in a comfortable, face-to-face environment. You come, meet some people, have a quick chat and see if you have enough in common to spend some time together. It is just that easy! People love our events because they are focused on chemistry. We all know what we want, we would just like the opportunity to find it. Our most consistent feedback is, “That was so much fun and easier than I imagined it to be!”
