I know Christmas isn't in November; still I have a present for you. That's right, there is a new release of Battle Jump labeled 0.11.0.
This version brings new features, like the possibility to play with gamepads! Also the collisions between the Jumper and the blocks have been changed in order to simplify the game.
Another cool feature is the fact that for now on, each user of your computer will have his own configuration files and his own levels.
Finally thanks to Sebastian 'DaBASCHT' Riedel the game is now translated into German.

This new version (0.10.0) brings tons of new features like new blocs, new levels, and new difficulties. Bloc that makes all the other blocs invisible during a few seconds.A bloc that translate with various speed.
This is the most significant feature of this version in term of game play.I let you discover the effect of this one.Another great feature is the translation of Battle Jump in several languages like Portuguese and Greek! (You can even make your own translation)
