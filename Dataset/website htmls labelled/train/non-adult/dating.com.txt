Tom
It is really cool to meet different people who come from different backgrounds than your own but have similar interests and values.
Whitney
My dating prospects in Tennessee were getting pretty poor, so I decided to try dating globally… I met Olivier from France on Dating.com and we can’t stop messaging each other!
Michelle
Dating.com brings out the sense of adventure in me! The website is so easy to use and the possibility of meeting someone from another culture that relates to me is simply thrilling.
Nicole
There are so many profiles on Dating.com… I like to browse through them carefully and select the most eligible person to talk to.
Dating isn’t about data. It isn’t about algorithms. It isn’t about how many friends you have in common, or whether you want a boy or a girl or no kids at all, it isn’t about how tall someone is or the color or their hair, and it isn’t about finding "the one".
Dating is a chance — a chance to meet someone new, a chance for them to introduce you to people, places and things that you never knew that you’d love. It’s the chance that you won’t like them and that they won’t like you. And it’s the chance that they will and that you will too. It’s the chance to spend time together — maybe a lifetime but maybe just an hour. It’s the chance to meet anyone, anywhere in the world. It’s the chance that there might be more out there, something you’ve never even imagined.
Are you ready to take a chance?
