Merry Christmas G&G Family!
2015 is coming to an end, and most of us are probably scrambling around for that last minute gift.
However, don't forget to give those ones you're wrapping those presents or staying up late putting the final touches on things for tonight a hug, a warm smile, and let them know that you treasure them most of all.
I know we are a gun forum, (and the friendliest one at that) but I can't help to feel a bit nostalgic and want to let all of you know I wish you a very Merry Christmas, and only the best wishes in 2016 to you and your loved ones.

Happy Thanksgiving Gun & Game Family!
Another year is coming to an end, as the countdown becomes more apparent with the arrival of Thanksgiving.
So many things to be thankful for this year...and one of them is still being apart of the family here on G&G.
While we all get busy, and pulled into other directions...G&G remains steady.
Stay safe, and I hope to chat with each of you real soon!

Firearm deer season opens the 15th.
Opening day for the 2015 fire arm deer season Opens on the 15th. I hunt in a non center fire
Rifle zone. For years I went to deer camp with friends in the UP of Michigan. I am the only remaining member since 2006.
Anyway I stay home and hunt in the back yard wood lot, Used a Muzzle loader for years but it seemed as though I was always having some thing crop up so decided to get a shot gun just for shooting slugs. I wanted a 20ga, had shot a friends 870 12ga and I didn't want the beating that thing gave.
Also decided I wanted a bolt action, They had just released the Savage 220 that year. I was real disappointed in the quality of the ones I looked at. Problems with the bolt hanging up on a couple and one even had the but pad falling off as it only had one screw barely started to hold it.

Take your lady hunting
Growing up going to those holiday family gatherings hunting is a topic that comes up quite regularly. The lady folk of the family usually make fun of how early the men get up for hunting, but can't seem to get enough sleep when there is a list of
chores to do.
However my little niece is the exception, she loves telling her hunting stories, her last kill, and what she's learning to perfect her hunt for the next one.
A man might be a natural hunter and gather...but a female that dives into it, I find to be a meticulous, calculated hunter, not to be underestimated.
Besides the family that hunts together, eats pretty darn well, right?

Miss South Carolina Gets Asked About Assault Rifles
Well, go figure that a pretty girl in a Miss America Pageant would get asked a question like this. However when Miss South Carolina Daja Dial was asked a loaded question about the Second Amendment, but the Southern beauty contestant was ready.
“America loves our Second Amendment, but gun violence continues to be a tragic problem. Do you support a ban on military-style assault weapons?”
