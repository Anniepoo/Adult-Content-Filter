Caffeine, E-Cig news, Zohydro and other Opioid news and death
May 8, 2014
Coffee and cigarettes have long been a part of the morning ritual ... now we have concerns about actual coffee/caffeine addiction.
E-cig news includes a study earlier this year, finding cancer indications like tobacco, especially snuff, from using e-cigarettes. However, the study used specially prepared lung cells, not humans. And the FDA has released its draft regulations for e-cigarettes, prohibiting their sale to minors, requiring warning labels, and asking that new device be submitted to the FDA for testing and evaluation.
Several more stories about opioids and heroin. Peaches Geldof, the daughter of Irish rocker Bob Geldof (Boomtown Rats) and founder of

And the protests continue about Zohydro, the new Vicodin-like medication that is 10 times stronger, and contains no acetaminophen.

conference in Hawaii. Utah is in the process of legalizing the medical use of "Charlotte's Web," the compound made of non-psychotropic molecules from marijuana. Pew Research released a report showing that public views on mandatory drug sentences have changed, with more than half now saying they should be modified and reduced, and wanting to see more treatment available.
A Virginia-based company received FDA approval for
an automatic injector of the opioid overdose antidote, naloxone, specifically tested and intended for use by caregivers, family members, or coworkers. And a new smartphone app for alcoholics in recovery, nicknamed A-CHESS, is being being developed and tested by the University of Wisconsin in Madison and others.
