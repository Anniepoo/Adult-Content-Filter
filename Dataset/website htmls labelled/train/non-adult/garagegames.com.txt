Happy New Year: Torque 2D Full Speed Ahead
There were a lot of great events in 2015, of which my favorite was the revitalization of Torque 2D MIT. Peter and Chris have taken up the reigns and wasted no time in improving our favorite 2D game engine. If you check out the GitHub pages for Contributors and Commit Activity, you will see a huge increase in activity. So it should be no surprise that we have a new release!

Torque 2D MIT: New Committee and Next Steps
Greetings everyone! Long time, no blog. I'll keep it short and sweet. Torque 2D MIT has been at a standstill for a few months now. For anyone who follows the GitHub feed, you may have noticed a recently flood of fixes and pull requests. I was recently contacted by Peter Robinson, who wishes to take over the engine, rebuild the committee, and push T2D to the next level.

Game Development Curriculum
In my last blog, I discussed GG|Interactive, a new initiative at GarageGames. We've been working hard on our curriculum and it's great to see it in the high schools and higher education.

Torque 2D 3.1 Available Now!
At the end of the 3.0 release blog, we mentioned wanting to review how changes are pushed from the development branch into master. Today, Torque 2D 3.1 is the result of that effort.
