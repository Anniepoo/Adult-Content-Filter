This site features Imperial Takeover™, a turn-based game of world conquest.
Unlike most games that demand large blocks of time to play through, this is a game you play a few minutes at a time over the course of days or weeks.
Log in a few times a day to make your moves.
Join a bunch of games or start some new ones, then come back later in the day to make your moves.
Games play out gradually around here so take your time, plan your moves, and enjoy a small diversion from the daily grind.
Starting every month, we have a special tournament for premium members, which resets on the first day of each month.
There is also a top 100 scorelist of all players participating in the tournament so you can keep track of your performance against other competitors.
Taking your turns fast, being a reliable player, and other victory benchmarks will earn you medals and tokens of acheivement.
Risk it all in this free online strategy game.
Players from around the world are meeting to play Imperial Takeover™, one of the internet's best free web based board games online.
Build armies, conquer enemy countries, and expand your empire over several continents to win the game.
The Strategy Game Network welcomes you to play, chat, and win in this exclusive club!
There is no cost to play, so try it risk-free.
Play war games online and enjoy.
