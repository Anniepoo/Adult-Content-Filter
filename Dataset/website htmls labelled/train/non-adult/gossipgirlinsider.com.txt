Details
Airing on The CW, Gossip Girl has become one of the most buzzed-about TV shows. What it wasn't, at least not until recently, was highly watched. But its second season has seen it grow in popularity as the CW teen drama builds the audience to match the hype.
Starring Blake Lively, Leighton Meester, Ed Westwick, Penn Badgley, Taylor Momsen, Jessica Szohr and Chace Crawford, Gossip Girl follows the scandalous lives of Upper East Side (Manhattan) teenagers.
The show is cheesy and a tad unrealistic, without a doubt, but also heartwarming at times, funny and self-aware - kind of like The OC, pre-sucking.
In short, with a sexy cast and addicting story lines, Gossip Girl is the ultimate guilty pleasure. The name comes from the infamous blog the characters read - and the book series upon which the show is based.

[to Jenny] That's the thing. You need to be cool to be queen. Anne Boleyn thought only with her heart and she got her head chopped off. So her daughter Elizabeth made a vow never to marry a man. She married a country. Forget boys. Keep your eye on the prize, Jenny Humphrey. You can't make people love you, but you can make them fear you. For what it's worth, you're my Queen. I choose you.
