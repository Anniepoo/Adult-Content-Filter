Welcome!
Hi Folks!
- Welcome to Tindle Music Company featuring the mountain dulcimer music and Christian songwriting of Mark Tindle.
These days Mark is in a very busy season of life with not much time for music (workin' the day-job and raisin' a family),
but is content with his current roles. He still manages to squeeze in a number of gigs each year with the
Downing Family bluegrass Gospel group (just to lift some hearts and keep the toes tappin').
Every once in a while, he also just "happens" to come up with another scripture song.
So, He decided not to abandon this website completely,
but still make available the music he's already done, as well as any new stuff that may come around, through the CD's, song samples,
and mountain dulcimer tablatures.
So, come on in, take a look around, and thanks for visiting!
