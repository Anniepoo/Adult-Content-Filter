Welcome
Thank you for your interest in The Freedom Center for the Creative Arts for you or your childâ€™s extracurricular experience. Classes are available for ages 2 to Adult. We look forward to serving you as we work together to empower you or your child to become creative and confident.
At TFC, we pride ourselves in being counter-culture, by offering quality dance instruction, using multiple genres of music and dance, all while in the comfort of a family atmosphere and Christian environment. This allows our students to flourish without the distraction of negative messages. Our core values include the use of clean movements, clean music, and a clean message!
