Women and children spend more than 4 hours walking for water each day, and more than 840,000 people die each year from water-related diseases.We're here to change that. We want to see communities break free from the cycle of poverty and spend time growing, learning, and thriving, instead of walking for water and fighting off illness.*Where we get our facts2014 Annual ReportSustainable Development GoalsHow To HelpOur MissionWomen + GirlsStories#GoCommando4ACauseWater For People is an international non-profit working across 9 countries to bring safe water and sanitation to 4 million people.For us, it isn't just about building wells, installing toilets, and setting up pumps, we're looking to create long-lasting water and sanitation infrastructure by talking to local community members, governments, and business owners, to find out how they live and what they need to feel healthy, safe, empowered, and successful. We're designing solutions based off of long-term needs and long lives. We don't want to be around forever, but we want these systems and services to last for generations to come.GuatemalaHondurasNicaraguaPeruBoliviaUgandaRwandaMalawiIndiaDonateWith your generous support, thousands of less fortunate people will gain access to safe drinking water, improved sanitation, and hope for a better future.Donate NowSpread the WordYou can help by just spreading the word.
