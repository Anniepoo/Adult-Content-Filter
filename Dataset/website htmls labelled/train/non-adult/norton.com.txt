Norton has one of the largest civilian teams of security experts in the world. Our Security Technology and Response (STAR) team is made up of 550 security engineers, virus hunters, threat analysts and researchers who battle on the frontline of digital crime, continuously monitoring and analyzing new threats — and devising new ways to protect you from them.
Over the past 25 years, the Norton team has built a rich proprietary database of security intelligence and one of the largest cybercrime-prevention operations in the world. Attack attempts on any of our 43 million customers provide new data and protection ideas for the STAR team.
Working from nine response centers located across the globe, STAR delivers around-the-clock protection to Norton Security customers, 365 days a year.
In addition to continuously developing the most up-to-date protection, STAR is fighting at the forefront of cyberattack investigations. Working closely with law enforcement agencies across the world, STAR helps to track cybercriminal groups and to innovate ways to effectively fight them.
Cybercrime gets personal.
Last year, 594 million people worldwide were hit by online crime.

We build that knowledge into every Norton product.

Norton security experts create next-generation protection designed to defend against the newest threats out there. And those timely product updates are automatically delivered to our customers.
Norton security products are built to perform for real people in real-world situations, whether you have a single connected device or a family full of them. And Norton wins the awards our customers care about, consistently outperforming the competition in independent head-to-head tests.
The accolades are just one measure of our relentless dedication to providing unparalleled online security. We’re thankful for the recognition, but we don’t build our easy-to-install and easy-to-use security products simply to win awards. We build them for you, your family and the people you care about.
We offer a protection promise only Norton can make.

Protecting your data and information is our only concern. It’s why Norton makes this bold promise to you: We’ll help keep your devices virus-free or we’ll refund your money.
The Virus Protection Promise is the assurance that, if a virus ever manages to slip through the Norton multi-layer defense system, our global team of technical experts will provide world-class support to remove it. In the unlikely event that the virus can’t be removed, you’ll get your money back.
You need multiple layers of protection to keep today’s savvy cybercriminals out. Free antivirus software, or the security built into your operating system, offers only limited protection. It’s like locking your front door, but leaving your windows open. You’re not completely protected. And free solutions won’t offer support if malware infiltrates your system.
The combination of our 25-year history of making security products, global footprint, powerful threat insight, cutting-edge technology and expert support enables us to offer the Virus Protection Promise to you.
We are supremely confident in our ability to protect you. And we want you to share in that confidence when you are online, surfing safely with the knowledge that you have one of the best security products in the world protecting your digital life.
Windows 10 is here. Norton has you covered.

Important pricing terms, offer details and disclosures*
Details about your Norton subscription:
By subscribing, you are enrolled in a recurring subscription that will automatically renew after the first term. You will have coverage on the specified number of devices during the subscription period, which begins upon initial installation and activation.
If an introductory or limited-time offer is presented, the offer is valid for the first term of your subscription only (term length depends on your purchase); after that, your subscription will renew each year at the then-current subscription renewal price. The price is subject to change, but we will always notify you in advance.
Your subscription includes protection updates and new features as available during the subscription period, subject to acceptance of the Norton License Agreement.
Product features may be added, modified or removed during the subscription period.
* To be eligible for the Virus Protection Promise, you must purchase, renew or upgrade your Norton subscription directly from Symantec, or subscribe to the Norton Automatic Renewal Service. If a Symantec service representative is unable to remove a virus from your device, then you may receive a full refund on the actual price paid for the Norton subscription, or if a Norton bundle, the total Norton bundle price paid (net of any discounts or refunds received and less any shipping, handling and applicable taxes, except in certain states and countries where shipping, handling and taxes are refundable) and only for the current paid subscription service period for that subscription or subscription bundle. The Norton subscription must be installed and activated on your device prior to the time it is infected by a virus. The refund does not apply to any damages incurred as a result of viruses. See Norton.com/guarantee for details.
