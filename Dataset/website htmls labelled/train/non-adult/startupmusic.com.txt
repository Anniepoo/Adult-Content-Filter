StartUpMusic.com - indie music resources and links
Founded in July 1999, StartUpMusic.com was an online oasis for the creators
and fans of independent music.
In less than two years, the company grew to 400
Member Labels
representing over 2000 artists from around the world.
Distribution and promotional
partnerships were struck with such companies as AOL, TAXI, Listen.com and Voquette.
Today, I work with a number of artists and labels, providing a variety of services, including consultation, web design, marketing and artist management. A few examples are on the right.
Check out IndieJazz.com, the best source for
indie jazz CDs, labels, artists and musicians.
If you enjoy jazz, also be sure to check out the site of master
jazz bassist and composer Eric Von Essen.
And don't miss the
sexy blue-eyed soul
of The Jane Doe's.
