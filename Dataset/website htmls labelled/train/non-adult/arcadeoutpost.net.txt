Outside of a brief recovery in the early 1990's the arcade machine has been on pretty much a steady decline since the age of competing home based video game console systems and computers became more affordable to the average home user.The first arcade machines were often found as amusement park midway games dating way back but gaining popularity in the 1920's. Games such as the ball toss game, shooting galleries and the earliest known coin operated machines such as a fortune teller machine were the beginning of this trend and often provided the inspiration for what we think of today as arcade games.
The first coin-op pinball machines were released in the early 1930's and were originally made from wood and used mechanical instead of electrical scoring mechanisms.In the 1960's companies like SEGA and Taito released electro-mechanical games such as Periscope and Crown Soccer Special, as well as light gun shooter games such as Duck Hunt and racing games like Grand Prix that were worldwide successes in the USA, Canada, Japan and Europe.In 1971 "Galaxy Game" was released by a group of Stanford University students and is what is considered to be the first coin operated video game. Also in 1971 Nolan Bushnell (one of the founders of Atari) created the first mass manufactured game which was called Computer Space. Following the release of Galaxy Game, Computer Space, and then the highly successful game Pong in 1972 (made by Atari) and into the late 1970's the electro-mechanical arcade games were slowly replaced by newer model electronic video games.
In 1978 Taito released Space Invaders which became the first blockbuster arcade game and started what is know as the golden age of arcade video games.During the late 1970's into the 1980's video arcades seemed to be on every corner. Chains such as Chuck E. Cheese turned huge profits by combining a restaurant atmosphere within their arcades/ Video game arcades could be found everywhere inside most malls and even grocery stores and movie theaters.
In its prime in 1981 the arcade video game industry was worth $8 billion (which equates to about $20.8 billion in 2015) but took a steady decline and by 1991 arcade game revenue had fallen to $2.1 billion due to the affordability of newly released home gaming machines.
There was a slight recovery in 1991 with Capcom's Street Fighter 2 which revived the arcade industry slightly but by 1999 revenue had dropped again in the United States down to only $1.33 billion and reached and all time low of $866 million in 2004.Currently arcades are not found in many locations with the exception of a random Dave and Buster or Chuck E. Cheese's around town. The love for arcade game machines has not been lost though and these days many people are wishing for the games of their past. Many arcade fans now own their own arcade games and have them in their homes. From classic games to the hottest new games if you love arcades then you can still find a way to play even in the age of home console systems and iPhone games!
