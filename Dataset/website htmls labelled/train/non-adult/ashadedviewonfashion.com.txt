KTZ, fall 2016 - text by Silvia Bombardini
Dear Shaded Viewers and Diane,
On board with the plan of calling up sportswear by way of its primary flare, something we've seen also at Sibling and Liam Hodges this season, was Marjan Pejoski with KTZ. His winter collection rang urban alright, yet not the kind that lets you blend in with the crowd, quirky sneaker or not. It came in a bold and leathery, often striped, elementary colour scheme of yellow and red, black and white, a hint of forest green. There were nods the ring and motocross gear in there too, but scheduled as the show was, right after presentations by both dunhill and Gieves & Hawkes, what was clear from the start was that you wouldn't find these guys playing polo anytime soon. indeed, bar those Union Jack flags that were almost pointedly worn as reassuring capes, this was an intriguingly American season for KTZ – with baseball as its driving theme. Knee-breeches, birdcage masks, and most importantly, stitches, featured throughout a great variety of outerwear, which was mostly oversize and visibly branded until a series of more formal, double-breasted notch-lapel styles towards the end. There also were fanny packs, varsity jackets, and pinball machine embroideries. Then again, Marjan’s fascination with the US is more than a one-time affair: less than a year ago, KTZ opted to show their Native American-themed womenswear collection in New York. If the fiery fans that came to the show and after party to profess their love are anything to go by though, London is ready to do all it takes to keep KTZ home.

Video of XujO3CZn1L0
Dear Shaded Viewers,
The films star the incomparable Italian actor Giancarlo Giannini as the Prince of Soragna, the home of Caruso’s impeccable tailoring. In Caruso's style, the prince goes to Milan to meet a mysterious woman who turns out to be his niece, he is travelling in a Lancia Aurelia B24, driven by his butler, more like a godchild and goes to the Four Seasons Hotel. The hotel used to be the Convent of St. Mary of Jesus for over three centuries. Well, I nvite you to watch the film.
Later,
Diane

J.W.Anderson, fall 2016 - text by Silvia Bombardini
Dear Shaded Viewers and Diane,
We walked into Yeomanry House early morning on Sunday and were greeted by a balmy beauty-centre ambient tune. Little did we know it would lead to Trace Elliot's The Techno Wave Is Back soon as J.W.Anderson’s show started. We had all spent an extra five minutes to get ready that day for his much discussed Grindr live stream – out of 7 million users, well you never know. And some gay-life clichés for sure were there, think studded plexiglass chokers and oversize nipple piercings as pendants, or hanging from lapels in just the right place. It’s a secondary theme that’s known to tempt LC:M’s designers now and again, take Pieter’s AW16 presentation for example: that CRUISE slogan jumper looked so catchy, I myself would wear it. But you don’t come to J.W.Anderson expecting anything explicit, and neither you should. As always, various narratives intertwined, yet the show went by smoothly, slicked by a certain ivory and silver sheen. The vulnerability and intimacy of online dating was perhaps on our minds as we took in a variety of billowy silks, like luxe sleepwear, that came in roomy, but much more viable silhouettes that J.W. would have once indulged. They were printed, sometimes all-over, sometimes locally and almost as stickers, with what looked like old-fashioned cartoons – a lamb, a puppy, a chubby toy weapon that could have come from The Jetsons. Occasionally, they were glazed over with an otherworldly opalescence. The most notable seasonal mascot, though, was the snail: quilted grey on grey, or pasted in mint and candyfloss pink over everything from black leather to white rabbity fur, it was like a pop invite to slow down and linger. Right next to those furs, were distressed, grungy woollen cardigans. But rather than a tale of rags to riches, or backwards, they read more as a matter of comfort. Together with thick ribbed wools, long-hair mohairs and a tailored puffer, they made for a very tactile, sensual collection. From J.W.Anderson’s all-front-row seats, it slid by close enough we could have touched it – yet, for a few months at least, still out of reach. And isn’t that a Grindr story after all.

Astrid Andersen, fall 2016 - text by Silvia Bombardini
Dear Shaded Viewers and Diane,
Those who came looking for sugary mesh and the gauzy sport kits that define by now Astrid Andersen's quest for a new representation of masculinity, one that's both enhanced and tenderised, were not exactly left longing. There were still golden sparkles of Sophie Hallette's lace, peaking through the trademark polyamides and oily, quilted nylons. As a whole though, this was a markedly less showy, more thought through, deliberately wearable collection. Less brassy, somewhat wiser too. What was before pure hard-line sportswear leaned this season towards traditional workwear silhouettes, as dungarees and denims were paired with textured, grungier long-sleeved knits. It were the textiles indeed, most of all, that really gave AW16 a boost. Echoes of a lusher side of heritage, such as a pleated velour matching set or cable knit crop top, which was especially strong when in aqua and worn over joggers of the same shade, reached their peak with Astrid’s unexpected collaboration with Linton Tweeds. From a century-old UK mill, the classy checks find a new home on tracksuit bottoms, bombers, hoodies and mittens – and who but Astrid Andersen could ever have guessed how cool and comfortable they would look at that.

GLOBAL WELLNESS SUMMIT MEXICO CITY MEXICO NOV 2015
Video of opMKTHE8Tz4
"The Global Wellness Summit (GWS) recently took place in Mexico City (November 13-15), gathering the brightest thinkers from a diverse cross-section of industries to contemplate the best strategies for “Building A Well World.”
It was the largest, most cross-disciplinary Summit in its nine-year history, attracting 470+ delegates from over 40 countries. Never have so many great minds from the medical (e.g., the Mayo and Cleveland Clinics, Harvard and Duke Universities) or workplace wellness worlds (e.g., Johnson & Johnson and Zappos) assembled at the conference.
“The Mexico City Summit was a watershed moment, because passionate leaders from economics, medicine, government, technology, spa/wellness, travel, education and the arts came together to debate how to bring preventative health into our chronic disease and healthcare cost burdened world – much like when the world first came together in Kyoto to declare solidarity against climate change,” said GWS Chairman and CEO, Susie Ellis."

SIBLING, fall 2016 - text by Silvia Bombardini
Dear Shaded Viewers and Diane,
When SIBLING reveals their winter muse to be no less than Jean Michel Basquiat, you could just wonder how come this didn’t happen sooner. It’s such a perfect match: the messy, neo-expressionist brushwork of the Brooklynite artist translates from wall and canvas to fair isle –
SIBLING’s own, perfected language. The result is a hand-knitted marvel that measures up to this top-notch art-world comparison more faithfully than any print could. As per the silhouette, it’s all Basquiat’s. Spacious, baggy suits from the hyperbolic 80s made to fit a larger-than-life personality, and droopy woollen jackets hanging loose, that call to mind couch throws and men’s housecoats, the classy loungewear we wore before the tracksuit. But it’s one particular portrait of the Brooklynite maverick that most of all drives the collection forward, the 1985 photograph by Michael Halsbland that finds Basquiat standing next to Andy Warhol in matching boxing gear, for the promotional poster of a collaborative exhibition. Other than granting context for supersized knitted gloves, punching bags and cushioned headgear, as well as shorts and socks, the reference lightens the troubled-artist mood and allows for SIBLING’s trademark sass to smoothly seep in. A more mature version of last season’s jock, the SIBLING boy retains some of his cheek – he gets on the ring to show off soft, shimmering medals and branded underwear, elevated now when we think of Basquiat in his Everlast boxers. The athlete, after all, was one of the artist’s personal heroes, and perhaps it’s time to separate our idea of sportswear from that of streetwear, of casualwear where it all got mixed up. It’s the former that inspires Sid Bryan and Cozette McCreery this season, in all of its flashy palette and promise of glory.
