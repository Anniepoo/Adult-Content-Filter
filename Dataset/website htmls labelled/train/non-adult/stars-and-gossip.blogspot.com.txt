Tyson Gets Caught. Again.
Boxer Mike Tyson may have been able to do away from drug rehab but it looks like things are still not going good for him. He was just recently caught because he was suspected of driving under the influence and also of possession of cocaine.Tyson may already be 40 years old but he is still planning of going back to the ring. But with his kind of attitude and with his kind of habits, it may quite be a long time before he an actually reclaim his glory.A source close to the boxer says, “Mike can't shake the drugs. He checked himself into rehab because he says he's broke and his only means of supporting himself is boxing. He had to get clean. He admits he does cocaine and mushrooms (a hallucinogenic) and that he drinks too much. But after only nine days, he left the facility, saying he felt like he was in a cage. One of the first things he did was find a nightclub and party with friends!”

It’s Poitier’s Memoir For Oprah
Oprah has shared that she has chosen Sidney Poitier’s memoir, “The Measure Of A Man”, as her personal choice of a great book. This great book allows readers to take a look inside the actor’s childhood, faith, thoughts, and ideas on the various things that has come through his lifetime.On this, Oprah says on her show, “He writes really candidly and passionately about his childhood, his family, relationships and his extraordinary career. It (the book) really is about what makes character, what makes you be who you are. He is the measure of one of the greatest men I think who has ever been on our planet.”And it looks like Poitier has been quite happy with this wherein he shares, “I proudly accept this honor on behalf of the forces that brought it about: the love of my parents, the ever-present kindness of strangers, and the hidden mysteries of the universe and, of course, Oprah Winfrey.”

Skinny Does Not Equate To Models
Undersized and skinny models have been banned from Spain’s Fashion Week. And it looks like with the New York Fashion Week coming up, such a trend would be following suit.Well, at least that is a good move. And according to the Council of Fashion Designers of America, they are going to take a stand on the weight debate that is going in and about the world of fashion and modeling. The committee of the fashion week would be working to make guidelines for both designers and models. Too skinny and you’re out.Von Furstenberg, the CFDA president, does state, “The fashion industry is acknowledging this weight debate as a serious issue. Together, with the medical professionals, we are committing to promoting good health and helping these young girls.”
