Out this week: The Banner Saga, Assassin’s Creed Chronicles: India and more

January continues to impress where new releases are concerned, with this week presenting us with two big name games – Assassin’s Creed Chronicles: India and indie darling The Banner Saga. We were expecting the console iterations of Gone Home too, but sadly they were hit with a last minute delay.
Assassin’s Creed Chronicles: India – the second game in Ubisoft’s 2.5D platforming mini-series – has been receiving mostly middling reviews, including 5.0 from GameInformer and 2.5/5 from GamesRadar. “Outside of the gorgeous, painted art style, it has few redeeming features” said the former. A few gaming sites dished out slightly more positive reviews, but literally just a few. God is a Geek is one such site, awarding it a 7.5 while praising the art direction and replay value.
If you’re curious about the Chronicles trilogy then bear in mind that a retail release is due next month on PS4, Xbox One and (drum roll, please) PS Vita.
Reviews for the luscious turn-based Viking role-player The Banner Saga – developed by ex-Bioware employees – are somewhat more positive. In fact, at the time of typing we’re yet to see a review score lower than 8/10. “The combat, while a little uneven difficulty-wise across the game’s campaign, nevertheless manages to hit the sweet spot between simple accessibility and strategic depth” said PlayStation Lifestyle, who handed out a lofty 8.5.
Other releases for this week are relatively few. Four more PlayStation 2 titles join the PS4’s library – cult RPG Arc the Lad: Twilight of the Spirits (£11.99), Star Wars Racer Revenge (£7.99), Star Wars Bounty Hunter (£7.99) and Star Wars Jedi Starfighter (£7.99). It’s our understanding that the three Star Wars games were previously only available via the PS4 Darth Vader console bundle.
2D sports sim Arcade Archives Super Dodge Ball (£5.79) also launches on PS4, as does sandbox puzzler Infinifactory (£18.99) which arrived to a positive reception from the PC posse. From the creators of SpaceChem and Infiniminer, it entails building 3D factories to assemble various products. PC Gamer in particular were smitten by it, awarding a staggering 93% before calling it one of the year’s best PC games. “It’s that accessibility that makes Infinifactory special: not only is it clever, but it shares its cleverness with the player” they beamed.

More Mega Man for Wii U Virtual Console

If it wasn’t for Capcom’s RPG duo Mega Man Battle Network 6: Cybeast Falzar / Gregar for Wii U Virtual Console, it would be an exceedingly quiet week for the UK Nintendo eShop.
The two Battle Network games are due Thursday at £6.29 a piece. First released on GBA in 2006, they gained above average scores from the likes of Nintendo Power and Famitsu. Most complaints stemmed from the fact that a lot of content was recycled from previous Battle Network games, with little improvement aside some new customisation options. Those who owned the previous instalments were still advised to give them a playthrough though as it’s here that the story finally comes to a conclusion.
The 3DS sees the rest of the week’s new arrivals. There’s a Etrian Odyssey 2 Untold: The Fafnir Knight demo due this Thursday, along with free Rosalina’s Yukata and Peach’s Yukata DLC for Nintendo presents: New Style Boutique 2 – Fashion Forward. Nintendo’s press release simply states that they’ll “extend your wardrobe”.
Final Fantasy Explorers – which has received some encouragingly positive previews – will be available to pre-purchase from Thursday too, way ahead of its 28th January launch date. Those who cough up £29.99 for the digital release will receive a free pixel art Final Fantasy 3DS theme.
It’s worth bearing in mind though that Amazon has the physical version for £23.99 currently. We’re pretty sure that most Final Fantasy fans and collectors would rather go physical for this one.

Battlefield 4 blasts back into the top ten

EA’s Battlefield 4 has shot up the UK top 40 this week, rising from #23 to #10. Chart-Track reports that 97% of sales were for the last-gen versions, which ties-in with the fact that it’s currently £1.99 at Argos on Xbox 360 and PS3.
What a nation of bargain hunters we are.
Due to the top ten remaining mostly unchanged, this is the most exciting thing to occur within the charts this week
Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 sees in the new year by holding onto #1. That’s then followed by FIFA 16, Star Wars Battlefront – which is still yet to leave the top #3 since launch – GTA V, and Fallout 4 at #5.
The rest of the top ten then comprises of Rainbow Six: Siege at #6, WWE 2K16, Just Cause 3, AC: Syndicate, and the aforementioned Battlefield 4 at #10.
Wolfenstein: The Old Blood made a top 40 reappearance at #21 while The Sims 4, Dishonored: Definitive Edition and Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare re-entered at the lower end of the chart. There were no new entries.

Cubot: The Complexity of Simplicity – Review
By Matt Gander
In Reviews

All signs point to publishers taking price point into consideration when planning releases for January, the thriftiest month of the year. The majority of games heading to retail this month are physical releases of previously digital-only titles. Cubot: The Complexity of Simplicity meanwhile arrived on Xbox One for a paltry £1.59, making it the cheapest game available for the console. Free to play games and Games with Gold freebies notwithstanding, of course.
It’s understandable to be wary about Cubot’s price tag. This only made it all the more of a surprise when we discovered that it’s actually pretty good. As the name suggests, it’s a simple and straightforward puzzler. The idea is to move coloured blocks towards tiles of the same colour and, well, that’s it. You’d think something this simplistic would soon grow repetitive, but this isn’t the case as new block types are introduced every eight puzzles. This is how the game is structured – ten levels with eight puzzles each, with the first in each stage acting as a tutorial to introduce the new block type.
These vary from Autoblockers, which pop up out the ground to obstruct your path, to self-explanatory Teleporters. It’s during the introduction of the green blocks that the difficulty level rises significantly, as these blocks have purposely irksome reversed controls. As for the other blocks, red blocks roll two spaces at a time while orange blocks latch onto others. Colour swap icons make an appearance later on too; a perfectly timed appearance that stops any potential complacency, no less.
Cubot never comes across as cheap or lazily designed
A move counter is always visible, which assists in keeping track of progress – if the numbers turn red it means you’ve gone past the minimum amount of moves to complete a level. The amount of moves required for the first few puzzles can be counted on one pair of hands, quickly increasing into double figures. If you find yourself in triple figures then it’s probably (read: almost definitely) best to try again from scratch. Fortunately there is means of skipping particularly bothersome puzzles. One ‘Cubit’ is gained at the end of each successfully completed puzzle. Collect eight and a solution can be revealed.
There’s a relaxed vibe present throughout. The music is calm and tranquil while the presentation is clean cut, complete with the occasional inspirational quote from the likes of Einstein between levels. The level design likewise helps to induce personality – one stage is titled Triforce and resembles the insignia from the Legend of Zelda series while another is titled Space Invaders, featuring a level layout shaped like the arcade classic’s iconic aliens. Moreover, there’s no punishing time limit or anything of the sort. You’re free to keep on cube rolling until you finally beat a stage.

Out this week: Amplitude, Hardware: Rivals, Hyper Void, Lovely Planet and more

With nine new releases, PS4 owners have plenty of potential purchases to consider this week. Hardware: Rivals is the obvious no brainer – it’s one of this month’s PS Plus freebies, alongside Grim Fandango Remastered.
There are no reviews of Hardware: Rivals just yet as it launched just a day ago. Reviews of Harmonix’s long awaited Amplitude (£15.99) reboot are bountiful though, including 7/10s from The Metro and God is a Geek and a 4.5/5 from GamesRadar. “The fact that Amplitude has only arisen from its own coma thanks to crowdfunding says a lot about its niche appeal. It just isn’t as mainstream as Guitar Hero/Rock Band, but that makes it so much cooler” they said.
Hyper Void bares similar psychedelic visuals. It’s a 3D wormhole shooter in the style of Tempest (shh, nobody tell Atari), available now on Xbox One (£7.99) and PS4 (£6.19). PlayStation VR support is promised for the PS4 version, incidentally. We’re sure it was released on PS4 months ago (we recall giving the demo a try) but according to the PS Blog it launches this week. We think there might have been a mix up – a belated PS3 version seems more likely.
Another space shooter launching this week is Zotrix (£7.99). Resembling Galaga and other retro shooters, it’s of the 2D variety. The trailer can be found here. That’s being joined by the dully titled Alien Shooter (£6.49, also on PS3) which is a top-down affair. The PS Vita version was released last May, gaining average reviews.

Thirty things that infuriate eBay users

It’s fair to say that most people who use eBay have a love-hate relationship with the auction site. For every bargain buy or smooth transaction you’re forced to patiently wait weeks for items to arrive, or simply put up with people’s stupidity.
We’ve been using eBay since the days when sending a cheque through the post was an acceptable, and common, means of payment. As such, we’ve come across all kinds of bizarre messages, requests and complaints over the years.
Sit down and get ready to seethe as we rattle off thirty things that infuriate eBay users.
eBay Sellers
When you receive a ‘Question for Seller’ and the answer could have been discovered by simply reading the item description
When you receive a ‘Question for Seller’ and it’s in a foreign language
When you receive a ‘Question for Seller’ and it’s in English, but due to poor spelling and grammar it may as well be in a foreign language
When you’re selling a large item and state that only inland buyers can bid, only then to receive a message from a buyer another country asking if you’ll ship it to them…
…which you eventually agree to as long as they cover postage costs. And then they don’t bid
When you’re selling an item on a standard auction and somebody simply messages you with “Buy it now?” No rough price, pleasantries or anything of the sort

GBA classic Drill Dozer finally surfaces in Europe
By Matt Gander
In New Nintendo Downloads

The UK Nintendo eShop is due a very humble assortment of new releases this week. Considering it’s only the first week of January this is all we could have hoped for.
On the agenda for this week: two Wii U Virtual Console games, two Wii U indie titles, a single 3DS indie and a demo of the JRPG The Legend of Legacy, which has been described by some as a spiritual successor to the SaGa series.
We’ll start with the week’s VC titles first – New Super Mario Bros. Wii (£17.99) and the GBA cult classic Drill Dozer (£6.29). It’s great to finally see Drill Dozer (née Screw Breaker) in Europe. Like fellow rumble-pack title WarioWare Twisted, it was never originally released over here due to the rumble pack containing mercury – a substance banned from electrical devices in Europe.
Developed by Pokemon studio Game Freak, destructive platfomer Drill Dozer went down incredibly well when it was first released in 2005 and was popular with importers. With a bit of luck Twisted will finally grace European Wii U consoles in the not-too-distant future.
As for New Super Mario Bros. Wii, the price isn’t as off-putting as we initially thought – physical pre-owned copies still sell for around £20. It’s a safe enough purchase for those bored with New Super Mario Bros. U.
The Wii U’s new indie titles are the 2D roguelike Temple of Yog (£3.99) and the Pictionary clone PictoParty (£7). Those who purchase Temple of Yog early will receive extra content for free while latecomers will be forced to fork out. Nintendo Life was mildly impressed by it, although they did warn that it’s hardly the deepest of experiences.

Final UK chart of 2015 sees a top ten shuffle
By Matt Gander
In UK Charts

Don’t be fooled into thinking this week’s UK chart is the first of 2016 – it’s actually the last of 2015, due to the 2nd January cut-off date.
2015 ended with Call of Duty: Black Ops III ruling the roost, making it five weeks at no.1. FIFA 16 still holds the record for weeks at the top during 2015 though, managing six in total.
Star Wars Battlefront remains at #2. It hasn’t left the top three since launch, which tie-ins in nicely with the fact that EA are allegedly on track to meet their 13m target. Industry analyst Michael Pachter firmly believes 12m copies have been sold so far.
Fallout 4 leapfrogs FIFA 16 to finish the year at #3. EA’s soccer sim has to settle for #4, while GTA V is at #5 for a second week.
At #6 it’s Rainbow Six: Siege. This is its highest chart position since launch, no less.
Assassin’s Creed: Syndicate holds onto #7, Just Cause 3 falls two places to #8, WWE 2K16 moves up to #9 and then at #10 it’s Forza Motorsport 6.
Meanwhile, The Elder Scrolls Online is the week’s biggest riser – up from #31 to #21 – while LEGO Dimensions is the biggest faller dropping from #22 to #36.
There were no new entries although 3DS farming role-player Story of Seasons – the final retail release of 2015 – made #12 in the 3DS chart.
