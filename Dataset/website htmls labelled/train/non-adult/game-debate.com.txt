Samsung Begins Mass Production Of 2nd Gen 14nm FinFET Node To Be Used For AMD PolarisWritten by Joffy S on 14 January 2016 at 17:30Samsung has announced that mass production has begun for its second generation 14nm FinFET manufacturing node. Thatâs of interest to gamers because semiconductor foundry GlobalFoundries licenses Samsungâs products for its own products - namely AMDâs upcoming Polaris GPU and Zen CPU devices."We are pleased to start production of our industry-leading, 2nd generation 14nm FinFET process technology that delivers the highest level of performance and power efficiencyâ said Charlie Bae, executive VP of sales & marketing at Samsung. "Samsung will continue to offer derivative processes of its advanced 14nm FinFET technology to maintain our technology leadership." [More]
Dragons Dogma: Dark Arisen ENB Graphics Mod Arrives Before The Game Is Even OutWritten by Neil Soutter on 14 January 2016 at 15:30Dragonâs Dogma: Dark Arisen isnât out on PC until tomorrow, but that hasnât stopped a graphics mod already being released for it. The ever-popular ENB series graphics mod is out, and itâs made swift work providing some startlingly good looking screenshots of the ageing last-generation RPG.Obviously this shouldnât even be possible ahead Dragonâs Dogmaâs launch, but it turns out some, uh, less legitimate copies have surfaced ahead of time. I put some time into the PlayStation 3 version and I have to say the difference between that and the PC version with the ENB shader pack installed is night and day. [More]

Google Gets Serious About VR With Formation Of Dedicated VR DivisionWritten by Stuart Thomas on 14 January 2016 at 14:00Google might have dipped its toes into VR with its budget Google Cardboard design, but the worldâs second-most valuable company still hasnât said a whisper about any premium virtual reality headsets. Itâs not like Google to be left behind, particularly in the light of Facebook and Microsoft ploughing ahead with their respective solutions. The Google Cardboard is easily the most popular virtual reality peripheral out there, but it relies on a decent quality phone and, er, itâs made of cardboard. I mean, most places are just giving them away by the bucketload.Well that looks like it could change, as Google has just launched its own dedicated internal VR division. It's being headed up by Clay Bavor, who was previously vice president of product management at Google. [More]
Worlds First Mini-STX Motherboards Arrive, Designed For 5 Inch Square PCsWritten by Joffy S on 14 January 2016 at 12:45The first motherboards built using Intelâs new mini-STX configuration have officially been launched. The mini-STX design measures just five inches by five inches, and is designed for use in mini PCs. I really do mean mini as well; these can be crammed into tiny boxes barely larger than the motherboard itself.The catch? Well at the moment these mini-STX motherboards are too small to house a discrete graphics card, so GPU performance is going to be extremely limited. Youâre going to be relying on the integrated graphics on CPUs. Intel has been busy bigging up the graphical capabilities of its iGPUs lately, but itâs still not going to hold a candle to a dedicated graphics solution. [More]
Number Of Hitman Pre-Orders Cancelled Due To Significant Configuration ChangesWritten by Neil Soutter on 14 January 2016 at 11:30If youâve lumped down some cash on a digital Hitman pre-order, you may have seen itâs been cancelled. Gamers are reporting their pre-orders are being refunded across a number of platforms, in particular those on PlayStation 4.That sets off a few alarm bells of course, but Io Interactive has moved to reassure fans, tweeting âIf your HITMAN preorder is cancelled, don't panic. Release date is still March 11. We're adjusting a few things & will update in a few days.â. âAdjusting a few thingsâ eh, whatever could that mean. [More]
Respawn Is Working On Unannounced Third-Person Adventure Along With Titanfall 2Written by Stuart Thomas on 14 January 2016 at 10:30While Respawnâs Titanfall sequel is already pretty much public knowledge, a recent job listing indicates the new studio formed of ex-Infinity Ward (of Call of Duty fame) devs is also working on a third-person adventure game. Which is a little surprising in truth. As a relatively young studio it was assumed theyâd only be working on one project at a time.The job posting is looking for a Senior Level Designer for both âTitanfall & an Unannounced Titleâ, for work in Van Nuys, California. The positionâs description indicates a new game is in the works set within the Titanfall universe. In all likelihood thatâs Titanfall 2, with all signs pointing towards it being multiplatform this time around. The second title is where things get interesting though, with âa new 3rd person action/adventure IPâ in the works. [More]
Its The Story Of Seasons In Impressive New Fallout 4 Visual ModWritten by Joffy S on 13 January 2016 at 16:30Itâs been a couple of months since its launch now, and modders have had a little time to get to grips with Fallout 4, despite the absence of the official mod kit. Iâve just had a go with the Fallout 4 Seasons mod and itâs easily the most impressive one to come out in this short time frame.Modder GameDuchess is the brains behind this overhaul, which adds in four custom seasons for Fallout 4 players. None of them (Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter) look much like the vanilla post-apocalyptic wastelands but thatâs sort of the point. Each is pretty distinct and fairly eye-catching, including a snow-covered winter and an overgrown summer thatâs got shades of Oblivion to its world. [More]
Franklin Voice Actors Rockstar Visit Sparks Rumours Of Grand Theft Auto V DLCWritten by Neil Soutter on 13 January 2016 at 15:00Shawn Fonteno, the actor behind Grand Theft Auto Vâs Franklin, has sparked rumours of imminent single-player DLC coming to Rockstarâs open-world behemoth. A new Instagram post by Fonteno shows the voice and motion-capture artist say in a full mo-cap suit at the Rockstar offices.Despite Grand Theft Auto 5 shifting more than 54 million copies and becoming the fourth best-selling game of all time, additional content has been conspicuous by its absence. Single-player content anyway, because thereâs been heaps of new bits and bobs added to the Grand Theft Auto Online component, which presumably has gathered quite a following. [More]
Rainbow Six Siege 1.3 Update C4s Cheaters And Improves Server Tick RateWritten by Stuart Thomas on 13 January 2016 at 14:00Ubisoft has rolled out another update for Rainbow Six Siege, making a number of key changes which it âfelt [they] needed to quickly fix.â Chief among these is an improvement to the server tick rate for consoles. This follows in the footsteps of a recent PC-only hotfix, doubling the tick rate from 30 to 60 times per second. This is essentially the number of times which both the server and the players are updated with player positions, projectile locations, etc.The faster the tick rate, the more accurate this data is. What it should prevent is issues of hit detection and player location. Iâve yet to give this update a try but itâll be interesting to see if this change actually makes a difference. PC gamers are being treated too, with a raft of anti-cheating improvements designed to weed out the little gits using hacks. Ubisoft has also removed the three-day ban for first time offenders in Rainbow Six Siege. Cheat now and youâre banned for good. [More]
