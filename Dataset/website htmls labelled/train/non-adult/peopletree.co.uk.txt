We Do Fashion Differently
People Tree is a different kind of fashion business. We give customers an alternative to fast fashion. Slow Fashion means standing up against exploitation, family separation, slum cities and pollution – all the things that make fast fashion so successful.
We make beautiful garments that are a living blueprint for our values: people and the planet are central to everything we do. Our garments are hand crafted in organic cotton and sustainable materials, using traditional skills that support rural communities.
