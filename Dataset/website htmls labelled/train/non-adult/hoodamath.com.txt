Where is the Math?
Escape Games are challenging and have a variety of puzzles, even including arithmetic problems. Every escape game is a puzzle itself, which makes learning adventurous. Papa's Games are so much fun no-one even notices that every game uses a different style of measurement for cooking timers. We especially like the pie fractions in Papa's Wingeria, notice how the food is evenly arranged on a plate for each customer. We could go on all day about each of our math games, but if you need more proof of math, read this Wiki article. Areas of Mathematics
