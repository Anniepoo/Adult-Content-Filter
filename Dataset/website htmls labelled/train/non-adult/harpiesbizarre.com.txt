Welcome
to
Bewitched @ Harpies Bizarre
This
on-line magazine relates to the Bewitched TV show. We offer
original articles, photos and sounds, as well as unique games. Why the
name Harpies Bizarre? For the answer to that, and other common questions,
see the FAQ at the bottom of this page. Frequent visitors
can find out "what's new" in Updates, also
on the cityscape below.
Continuum
Update
A
new reference manual focused solely on the Bewitched TV
show is available.
The Bewitched Continuum: The Ultimate Linear Guide to the Classic
TV Series by Adam-Michael James was published by
Bright Horse Publishing in October 2014. This paperback book features
an episode guide, colorful commentary, and photos weighing in at
630 pages to chronicle the continuity of the show through all 254
episodes. Whether you are a hardcore fan or are just discovering
the show for the first time, The Bewitched Continuum promises
to cast a spell you won't soon forget!
After
years of weekly "40 Years Ago..." posts as Dr. Bombay
on our message board, David Pierce has partnered with BearManor
Media (publisher of the ultimate Agnes Moorehead tome I Love
the Illusion by Charles Tranberg) to produce The
Bewitched History Book. This softcover book is
a whopping 732 pages and ties events of the 1960s and 70s to the
air dates of all 254 episodes of Bewitched. The book
features colorful reviews of each episode, photos, an index, and
the in-depth trivia that fans of Bewitched crave.
If you are interested in getting a signed copy,
you can coordinate that with the author through bewitchedhistorybook@gmail.com.
UPDATE: The
50th Anniversary edition is now available in hard back. This book
features 748 pages.
BEWITCHED:
THE COMPLETE EIGHTH SEASON is available! Samantha casts her final
spell via DVD in this series ending installment. The 4-disc DVD
set contains 26 episodes.
The
Salem News reported on Bill Asher, Jr.'s trip to Salem,
MA. This trip is the first time that Bill got to see the statue
of his mother, Elizabeth Montgomery, as Samantha at Lappin Park.
He had his young daughter, Makaela, with him. Although Makaela
never got to meet her famous grandmother, you can tell by the
look in her eyes in this photo that she was delighted and bewitched
by the bronzed beauty.

Elizabeth
Montgomery received a star on the Hollywood Walk
of Fame. The star is nestled into the sidewalk at 6533
Hollywood Blvd. in Los Angeles, CA as a testament to her excellence
in movies and television. Her children Bill and Rebecca Asher
accepted the honor on her behalf. Fellow actors, husband Robert
Foxworth (Six Feet Under, Falcon Crest)
and friend Liz Sheridan (Seinfeld),
also spoke about her at the event. Despite the rain, the turnout
was good for the event as family, friends, and fans from around
the world gathered to watch the star be unveiled. Special acknowledgment
goes to Greg Howell for coordinating the application effort for
fans of Elizabeth Montgomery throughout the world and for Rebecca
Asher for overseeing the ceremony and planning.

and Video from the ceremony!
Samantha
in Salem
A bronze statue of Elizabeth Montgomery as Samantha from Bewitched
is stationed in Salem's Lappin Park, near the Salem Witch Museum.
The dedication was attended by former cast members Kasey Rogers,
Bernard Fox, and Erin Murphy, as well as Executive Producer Bill
Asher. The tribute is sure to garner years of great photo opportunities
for Bewitched fans, who fondly recall Salem as the backdrop
of the first eight episodes of season seven.
