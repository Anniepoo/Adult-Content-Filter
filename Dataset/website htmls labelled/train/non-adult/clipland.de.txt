A music video database?
Well, Clipland is a database about short form media. By that we mean it's a music video database. But it's also a tv commercial database. The reason is: many people working in music videos - directors, cinematographers or DPs - also do gigs for brands, instead of for musicians. And then, to round off the information, you also have to include short films, a short film database. Many filmmakers start their career with a short film, as a calling card. And finally, while some directors stick with music videos or the short form in general, some change into feature films. That's why you'll find references to feature films in Clipland as well (although there are more complete databases about movies elsewhere). So here it is, Clipland's philosophy. That's how we try to convey the 360 degree picture, and that's why we don't limit Clipland to be a music video database, or short film database, or tv commercial database only.
