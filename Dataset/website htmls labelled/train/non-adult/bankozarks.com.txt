Helping You Acquire the Right Equipment is our Business
Our leasing division provides state-of-the-art lease financing as an alternative to a traditional loan. Leases vary widely from small, one-person operations to Fortune 500 corporations, and the equipment leased is just as diverse. Transactions range from a few thousand dollars' worth of equipment to multimillion-dollar telecommunications systems, medical equipment (including CAT scanners and MRI imaging), office systems, computers, corporate aircraft and transportation fleets.
Please complete the form below to begin. One of our Bank of the Ozarks leasing professionals will review and contact you soon. If you have any questions, please feel free to call us at 1-866-625-6690.
