Welcome to Ozark Bank
Serving the Ozarks Over a Century
Ozark Bank is YOUR hometown community bank. Our customers aren't just "customers", they're our family, friends, and neighbors. For over 100 years, we have proudly served the financial needs of the Ozarks with a full line of personal and business banking services. We also do our best to serve the local communities' needs by reinvesting every dollar you deposit at Ozark Bank back into your community. Things like helping someone buy their first car, assisting a new local business take root, and supporting city and county bond projects are made possible because of you. Our primary goal is, and always has been, to assist you in achieving financial success.  This is why we've built a team with local leadership and knowledge of the Ozarks' economic culture.
At Ozark Bank, we strive to stay current with economic trends and technology by offering the latest products and services to our customers. As a result of this, our customers now have access to over 3,500 surcharge free ATM locations across the nation. We've also updated the tools and features of our website and launched a new Mobile Banking option to make life on the go a little bit easier.
Visit our branches in Ozark & Nixa or give us a call and we'll be glad to start a conversation on how Ozark Bank can fit your banking needs.
