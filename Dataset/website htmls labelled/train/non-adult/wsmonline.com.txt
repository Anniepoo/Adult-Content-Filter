650 AM WSM is one of the most important radio stations in my life. I love the fact that you can tune in any time, day or night, and hear the amazing history that’s gone on with our music and what’s coming before us. The one place in the world that you can hear the current records of today and also the great records from fifty, sixty, seventy years ago.

I just love the Way Back Wednesday with Eddie Stubbs and you guys have great guests in the morning with Bill! I just really love what you guys are doing with Nashville music. I think you are the definitive country music station in America!

I love listening online. These guys really know how to program a real Country radio station. Listen online for yourself, if you want to try a radio station that knows what they’re doing.

I wake up every morning with Bill Cody and go to sleep every night with Eddie Stubbs and often hear Marcia Campbell in between!

Howdy to everybody listening out there on WSM-AM. It’s amazing that people all over the world listen to this station, and it’s one of the last few that plays real music out there.
