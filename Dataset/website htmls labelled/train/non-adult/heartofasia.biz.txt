An American man seeking a foreign bride may avail himself of over 200 different services in which foreign women advertise for husbands. There are two types of such services. In one type,the so-called "mail-order bride" industry (representatives of the industry prefer the term "international correspondence service"), women's names, photos, biographical sketches, and
addresses are presented in hard copy brochures or on the Internet.

Visas fall roughly into two classifications, non-immigrant (for visitors, employees, and missionaries, for
example), and immigrant (permanent visas for things like the visa lottery, families intending to move
permanently to the USA, business investment, and new marriage partners). The K-1 visa is in a bit of a grey
area: although it is officially called a nonimmigrant visa, applicants intend to apply for immigrant status
after arriving in the USA.
In these services, the agency provides the photos and descriptions of the women, who are not charged for this listing. Men who
wish to obtain the mailing address of any of the women they would like to contact are charged a fee of from $2 to $5 for each of the mailing addresses

The other way to contact potential spouses is through e-mail "pen-pal" clubs. These services are generally free of charge. In them, men and women provide biographical data, an e-mail address,
and an indication of what type of relationship they seek. The women are obtained through advertisements in local newspapers and popular women's magazines and, most commonly, through word of mouth.
