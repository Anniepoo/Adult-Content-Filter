This calculator is made available as a self help resource for your planning convenience.
The results from the calculator are based on your inputs and are not intended to be a financial
plan or investment advice from the Principal Financial Group® but may be used as general guidelines
to help you make retirement planning or other personal financial decisions. Responsibility for these
decisions is assumed by you, not the Principal Financial Group. Individual results will vary.
You should regularly review your savings progress and post-retirement needs.
All projections, analysis and calculation results are estimates and depend on many factors,
including the data and assumptions you provide, and may not reflect all your sources of income
or expenditures. In addition, it ignores future transactions or changes in tax laws which cannot
be anticipated. The reports, graphs and other analysis are dependent upon the accuracy of the
data you provided.
This calculator is provided with the understanding that none of the member companies of The Principal
are rendering legal, accounting, or tax advice. Results may not be used to avoid penalties under the
Internal Revenue Code. You should consult with appropriate counsel or other advisors on all matters
pertaining to legal, tax, or accounting obligations and requirements.

Your Retirement Wellness Score
Your Retirement Wellness Score indicates the percentage of your pre-retirement income that is estimated to be
available at the specified retirement age (based on your personalized inputs and current assumptions). Studies
suggest replacing at least 70-85% of your income in retirement.
*
The score compares what you are estimated to have in monthly income at retirement against your estimated monthly
pre-retirement income. For example, based on your inputs you may have $1,000 per month when you retire, but your
monthly pre-retirement income is $2,000. Your Retirement Wellness Score would be 50.
This score, and what you will have, are merely estimates based on information provided by you and several
financial assumptions, including a 4.5% withdrawal rate. This information may be valued as of different dates.
This is not a guarantee of future income.
Your Retirement Wellness Score always assumes you are replacing 100% of your pre-retirement income.
So, it will not change if you make changes that impact your desired income in retirement.
