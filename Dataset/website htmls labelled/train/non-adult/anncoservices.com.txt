NewsDuring the winter season, Annco staff will begin installing winter annuals. Factors in designing landscaping using annuals include lighting, size of bed, location, sunlight (exposure), and moisture of area. All these conditions determine the best plant material for the location.NewsAnnuals seasonal color displays create quite a presentation and should be used to highlight and accent focal points. Annuals for winter have traditionally been New Guinea Impatiens and Begonias; however, Annco is always looking for new species.NewsKey to installation is bed preparation. A good soil mix to allow for drainage with some organic material mixed in;broadcast applications of a time release fertilizer/fungicide increase the plant’s ability to sustain plant growth.
