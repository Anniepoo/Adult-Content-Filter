Donations to support the openSUSE project are always welcomed. In fact, Open Build Service, which is used by several other open-source projects, was made available to the project’s community through a generous donation of servers by AMD. It is this type of donations that allows people and projects to thrive, develop, innovate and progress. The project is not asking for money, but donations of hardware to use the open-source community’s expertise to empower Linux development, provide openSUSE tools to the free, open source ecosystem and give back to developers, sysadmins and packagers. Hardware helps the openSUSE community! Hardware helps the open-source community! And Hardware helps Linux development. To learn how you can donate hardware to the openSUSE project, email
