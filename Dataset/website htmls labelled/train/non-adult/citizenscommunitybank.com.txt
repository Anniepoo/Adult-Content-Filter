Welcome to Citizens Community Bank!
Since day one, Citizens Community Bank has always promised
to do right by its customers. Our goal is to keep the
community at the heart of our decisions and to stay locally
owned.
Since 1992, that promise still has not been broken. We
intend to keep it that way. While Citizens Community Bank
continually adds new products and services to accommodate
your needs, such as Internet Banking and Bill Pay, we
will
never take away the personal service. It is what worked for
us over the years and it is still our number one priority.
