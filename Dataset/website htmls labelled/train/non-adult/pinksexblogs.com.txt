What Our Customers are Saying
A great place to do business, the owner is a great person, and very friendly. He will order the gun that you want if he doesn’t have it in stock. All of his prices on guns, ammo, accessories are very reasonable and he makes great deals!
John
This shop came highly recommended from several friends. The employees in this shop had a profound depth of knowledge on firearms, yet did not try to dazzle me with their knowledge.  They were very helpful in educating me on my purchase, and were very patient with me. The selection in Cochise Firearms is to die for! I did not even compare prices with other shops around town…
Adam
