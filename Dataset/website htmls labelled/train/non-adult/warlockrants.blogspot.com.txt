Czech Republic: 15 grams or 5 plants not a criminal offense
There's a sense of hope among some in the cannabis community that 2010 might be the year where we start to see real change worldwide in the status of cannabis. Although the new year is not a week old yet there has already been some good signs,In the Czech Republic on the first day of this new year, new decriminalisation quantities went into law, the decision to decriminalise small amounts of certain drugs happened late last year but confusion surrounding the amounts tolerated meant the government had to specify the amounts. Under the new laws possession of less than 15 grams or 5 plants of cannabis will not be a criminal offense:You can check out the list of the amounts now tolerated in the Czech Republic on this webpagehttp://stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle/special/czech_republic_decriminalization_amounts
