Welcome to OxygéneéOxygénée was one of the pioneers of the modern absinthe renaissance, and has been a leader in the field since the late 1990's. We have offices in France and in Germany and are proud co-owners of the historic Distillerie Les Fils d'Emile Pernot in Pontarlier, one of only two French absinthe distilleries surviving from the pre-ban era.Our German subsidiary, Rueverte GMBH, operates its own bonded warehouse in Freiburg, and coordinates our shipments of the very best absinthe, bitters and digestifs worldwide.Our Finest & Rarest division is the premier specialist and market leader in selling authentic bottles of original 19th century spirits, including pre-phylloxera cognac, ancient whiskies, pre-1903 Chartreuse and early Rhum Agricole. In 2010 we handled the sale of the oldest and most valuable cognac bottle in existence, the unique 270 year-old Clos de Griffier 1738. Finest & Rarest also handles some of the rarest and most romantic of all wines, including Madeira, Tokaji Essencia and Chateau Chalon from the nineteenth and even eighteenth centuries.
