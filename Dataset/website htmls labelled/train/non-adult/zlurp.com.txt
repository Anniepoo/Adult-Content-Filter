Welcome to our web site!
Here you can find the latest
versions of ZLURP! and our favorite audio encoders.
What's New
Updated Version
Happy For Now

MAY.22.2005
New Version 1.9.4
Made EXTended info happy again for now.
Wanted to get a bit more done this weekend, but I got the flu and lost all
my motivation!
Did make a list of things I'd like to tackle in the next few months.
Want to get a few things back up to date - newest LAME, newest ID3V2 tagging,
newest freeDB protocol.
And have a couple of features I want to add, like a Quick Rip setting (a great suggestion by loyal Zlurper "fast slow").
So here's to
the Zlurp Summer of 2005, and no more flu!

Once Again, Pesky EXT Info

MAY.18.2005
Working On It
CDUniverse has changed their way of doing things, so I'm in the process of tweaking.
You may want to temporarily turn off getting
EXTended info for the moment.
ETF (est time to finish!) the newest fixes is Monday.
Hopefully I can get a couple of other odds and ends in by then too...

AUGUST.15.2004
New Version 1.9.3
Silly CDUniverse decided to change their site format just enough to make EXTended info unhappy. Zlurp! should once again be back in action getting your EXTended info.
Also took a look at the WAV to MP3 functionality. There were some problems that I ironed out.
If you still have trouble with it, drop me a note.
Thank you one and all for helping me find any problems with Zlurp! Couldn't do it without you!
:-)
Updated Version
Fixing the Fix!
R
E L E A S E D
FEBRUARY.8.2004
New Version 1.9.2
Well, fixed one problem and broke something else! There was a problem if you had too much free space on your hard drive. The place I stored the calculation overflowed and Zlurp! thought you only had a tiny amount of free space.
Fixed that, but I broke when you only had a little bit of free space. D'oh! So here's a shiny new version that should be happy to let you rip if you have enough room to store the result!
As always, if you have any problems, please tell me so I can FIX IT! :-)
New Version

New Version 1.9.1 With Win XP/2000 Support is Here!
Good things come to patient Zlurpers! Finally have a reasonably ready version for you all to try.
I still consider this a beta version. It needs a lot more testing, which is where YOU come in! ;-)
If you have any problems with the install or running of this version, please give me a holler! I'd really appreciate it, and everyone will benefit from
squashed bugs!
New Stuff:
EXTended info is back and better than ever! If getting info an any disc gives you any problems, please tell me the artist and title of the disc so I can see what the heck went wrong.
Track Organization has been enhanced. You can save the title names in all upper or lower case. You can organize the output by genre, artist AND album.
OS Auto Detect so Zlurp will run on both Win 98 and XP/2000.
Tidbits I Know About:
- If you are having trouble with your install or Zlurp! can't find your CD-rom, some people have had success by starting their computer in safe mode, installing Zlurp! and then running it the first time to let it initialize. As far as I can
tell, there may be some CD burning software that is running in the background that prevents Zlurp! from getting info about your drives. When you start in safe mode, that software will not be running.
- Many many discs are now enhanced CDs. They have video or web content or other fun stuff on them. Traditionally, the last track before this data had been very difficult to rip. Zlurp! has always handled this well. It does seem on XP/2000 that you may have to
do more tweaking by hand to get this right. If you get a "Problem With Track" message on the last track before data, here's what you do...
Go to Settings, Input/Output
You will be changing the value in the Multimedia Offset field. Try bumping it up by 2. The higher this number, the shorter you are making the last track. The track is failing in the first place because it was calculated to be too long, and is running into the data!
Hit OK
Then you must Get Info AGAIN! This is a very important step - this is where Zlurp! will recalculate the track length.
Select the track and rip it!
If you still get the problem message, go back and bump up the number again. If you bump it up too high, you will cut off some of the song, so listen to that last track and see if it gets chopped off. If that happens, adjust the value 1 or 2 lower!
It usually takes me 2 times at the most to get my last track taken care of if I had a problem!
Still To Do:
Major, huge work on the Help!!!!
Fix any install bugs you-all find. :-)
Then, I will tackle the other 2 platforms - Mac and Linux! I can't wait!

New verison
of ZLURP!
Hello my patient Zlurpers!
First I want to thank you all for your prayers and kind words of support. It's nice to know there are so many amazing people out there in this world.
Thank you from the bottom of my heart!
Good news - I've taken out the expiration date.
Now you will
always have a fully working cow.
To automatically check for a
new version when you fire Zlurp up, go to the General Settings
and check the "Check For Update".
There have been a few large changes in the outside world
since I've done major work on Zlurp!
CDDB has gone away.
Bye
bye!
I had some fundamental differences with the CDDB² people's
philosophy, so Zlurp will be using the freeDB database exclusively.
I have some more testing to do on that code, so please let me know
if there are any problems finding your CD's track names.
The other main issue is that CDNow was bought by Amazon.com.
Zlurp would get EXTended info from them.
I've switched to using
CDUniverse, but the interface isn't quite finished.
Rats!
But
I figured all you loyal Zlurp fans would want a working Zlurp as
soon as possible.
So, EXTended info is temporarily disabled.
THESE ARE NOT READY YET BUT ARE IN THE PIPELINE!!!
The next goals are:
Version 1.3 will have EXTended info back.
Version 2.0 will have Win2000/WinXP support!
Yay!
Finally, I had to redo the installer from scratch because that
was one of Chuck's tasks.
Please let me know if there are any install
problems!

Difficult news to report
On September.4.2002 Chuck and I (Ilana) were in a car accident. A car swerved into our lane and hit us head on at a high rate of speed. Chuck did not survive the accident. I am still learning how to walk again. All of Chuck's friends and family deeply miss him. If you would like to learn more about the kind of person Chuck was, please visit his memorial page at www.hatman.com
I will try to continue with Zlurp. I am planning to add the much requested Win2000 and WinXP support. It is hard work for me now, so please bear with me - I will do the best that I can.

Some issues have come up about ID3v2
tagging. Seems the two biggest MP3 exchange clients are not supporting
ID3v2. Napster and Scour
look at the tag in MP3's to help their search engines give you faster and
more accurate hits.
The ID3v2 tag comes before the MP3
info, so when Napster or Scour expects to see MP3 info, they see the tag
info instead. So, the problem is they don't think ID3v2 tagged MP3's are
MP3's!
They only support ID3v1.
ZLURP! by default is set to tag your
MP3 files with this extended tag info. Please take some time to learn about
ID3v2 at www.id3.org web site. ZLURP!
does what no other tagger can claim. Once the disc info is found from CDDB,
ZLURP! will go out and grab the album cover art to use in the ID3v2 tag.
Sort of a one stop shop ripper!
If you would like to create MP3's
that work with these MP3 exchange clients you need to "UNCHECK" ID3v2 on
the main page.
But please respond to both NAPSTER
and SCOUR and tell them you would like to see ID3v2 support.
It's as easy as 1..2..3!
1) Click
to e-mail them!
2) Send
3) Repeat!

A new version of ZLURP! has been
released today.
Lots
of fixes and treats!
Your input has been invaluable
in hunting down Zlurp! problems.
We would like to say THANK
YOU THANK YOU to all who have taken the time and trouble to tell us about
any Zlurp! snarls!!!
Display Art bug has been attacked
and hopefully annihilated. When internet access is disabled, you will be
able to rip all the odd tracks now, instead of just 4.
Biggest new feature - WAV tagging.
Allows you to tag a WAV file as it's created.  Then you can convert
a batch of WAVs to MP3, and the tag info will be there!  This version
just tags ID3v1. Will try to get ID3v2 in next time.
Batch WAV to encode is in.
Thanks to Jim Atkinson of 3WK
Underground Radio for all his wonderful suggestions and bug testing!
