Happiness found, Thanks Oasis
2 and half years ago, me and my partner found ourselves logging in to Oasis dating, after having long term relationships failing, we were both back on the market. Neither of us really liked the pub/club scene and were worried about how we would find love.
It was actually my mum that told me to try online dating, I'm so glad she advise me to do this (never would of thought of it myself).
We spoke online for a few weeks using your a
mazing services, we decided to meet up, then I was diagnosed with appendicitis and the date was put on hold, after being in hospital for a few days and having an Op, my partner decided to meet me the evening I was sent home.. I looked terrible in my pjs and feeling very sorry for myself. He was very sweet and kind (even though I looked awful) from then on we was pretty much inseparable.
2 and half years later, we live together and have 2 kitty cats and extremely happy, we have become better people because of we have each other. We are planning on having a forever relationship, Thanks to Oasis dating!
I have now got my best friend on Oasis, to find love as I was so successful. You can find the one ONLINE!

My hunny and I
My lovely man and I have been together almost a year and we are perfect for each other. I went on several dates from Oasis before I met him on here and no one was quite right. I almost gave up hope and then met the love of my life. I have never been treated like such a princess or been in so much love. Don't give up hope ladies/gentlemen, your hunny is out there too!
