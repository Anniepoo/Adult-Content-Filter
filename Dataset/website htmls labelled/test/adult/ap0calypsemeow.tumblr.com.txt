My Wife’s Lovers, 1891, Carl Kahler
God I hope I am immortalised by my husband for having 40 cats
Fun facts:
It cost $5,000 in 1888 to have this painting made, which is more than $120,000 in today’s money.
I say 1888 because it took three years for Kahler to complete, reportedly because he spent most of the time studying and sketching each cat to get a feel for their personality.
It was painted for Kate Johnson, the title was her husband’s idea though, proving him the most patient and good-humored husband in the history of crazy cat ladies.
Speaking of cat ladies, the picture actually contains 42 cats. Or more specifically, Mrs. Johnson’s 42 most favorite cats. She had 350 in total.
It sold at auction via Sotheby’s a few days ago for over $800,000 dollars, vastly more than its $200,000-$300,000 estimate.
The buyer is a private collector in California.
Probably someone who really, really likes cats.
I mean, really likes cats.

Graveyard Queen
The concert was almost over, what a show it had been. She was right in front of the stage, singing along and at times, making eye contact with the lead singe. He was easy on the eyes, typical greaser. Not to mention he also played stand up bass, and she could only imagine what he could do with those fingers. They were playing an impromptu show at a local dive that was dimly lit and surprisingly intimate for its seedy outwardly appearance. The last song ended, and the band thanked the crowd and left the stage. After awhile, the band trickled through the crowd, hanging out with fans and drinking pints of beer. She felt the warmth of someone watching her and turned around to see the lead singer, the looker, eyeing her from a distance while he talked to other girls. He excused himself and walked towards her, her legs were shaking. He had a gaze that you felt deep down in your soul, penetrating and hot.
“Hi I’m Vic you look familiar, I think I’ve seen some of your photos of our shows on the Internet.” He said, awkwardly extending his right hand for a shake.
“Hi, yes! Great show, always a great time. I’m Rachel.” I met his right hand with mine and it was electric. I know he felt that too, because he changed his stance.
“Want to get out of here? I need some air.” He said, setting down his empty glass.
“I’d like that.”
He grabbed her hand, and suddenly they were face to face. He wasn’t very tall, maybe 5'7"-5'8", dark hair styled in a small Pompadour, dark eyes, tattoos, sporting a cutoff jean jacket with various patches, again, typical bad boy. She’d always been attracted to his baby face, ever since she first saw the band ten years earlier, she was drawn to him. His voice stayed in her head, swirling and embedding. She’d often masturbate to specific pictures of him, and now he was looking at her, she could smell him. Faint smell of motor oil, soap, and sweat, but it was a cologne that she’d never forget.
“Are you scared?” He asked.
“No.”
“Good.” He said, putting his hands on her neck, pulling her towards him and kissing her deeply.
They leaned up against the wall, kissing slowly, passionately, intimately, then roughly. She’d only just formally met him, and it’s like she’d know him forever. A connection had been made.
“I know of a place around here you might enjoy.” She said, pulling away, teasing.
She was all of 5'3", petite but curvy in the right places. Long dark hair which was in victory rolls, and her emerald eyes pierced his. She wore a leopard print skirt that hugged her hips, an emerald green top, she felt him watching her with hunger. She made a come hither motion with her finger and he obediently followed.
They walked a few blocks, both of them quiet, but the intensity was there. The cemetery came up on the left, shadowed by large weeping willows and elm trees.
“Perfect baby.” He said, grinning. She knew he’d love it.
She smiled at him and he suddenly picked her up and she put her legs around his waist. He carried her to an enormous headstone next to one lonely dead tree, sitting her down and pushing up her skirt. Her legs started to shake, she couldn’t believe this man was going to fuck her in the graveyard. He ran his hands along her inner thighs, his fingers pulling down her stockings. He pushed her thighs up and apart and she gasped, trembling, and she knew he felt it.
“Mm baby, I want to taste you.”
“I’ve been so wet for you since I first saw you get on stage, my panties are soaked.” She said.
He pulled them down and she threw her head back in anticipation. He licked her inner thighs, she couldn’t wait to feel his fingers inside of her. He put a thumb on her hood and spread her lips with the other hand, exposing her tender clit. Fuck, she thought, I could cum instantly. His beautiful brown eyes that she had always gazed at in magazines were now looking up at her from between her legs, hungrily. He spread her wide, licking the length of her pussy with long, slow licks. Wow…her pussy was so hot, and with the heat of his mouth and his skill, she was sure to cum, but held back. She grabbed his head in impatience, fucking his face, and he liked it.
“I want to make you scream baby.” He said, wetting his fingers and sticking two inside of her. The fingers he used for the strings of his bass.
He found her g-spot immediately and rubbed it vigorously, thumbing her clit and looking straight into her eyes. She loved that eye contact.
She rode his fingers and was about to cum, she couldn’t hold it any longer, he must’ve known because he pulled them out, leaving her trembling and tender.
She had to see his cock, she had fantasized about it for years. She got off the tombstone and faced him, grabbed his hand and licked his moist fingers, tasting herself and then kissing him. She put her hands on his hips and they shared a surprisingly intimate kiss. She slid her hands down and over his belt buckle, unfastening it and unzipping his pants. Pulling them down to reveal boxer briefs and a very nice erection. She pulled his warm cock out and knelt before it. He moaned with the sensation of her hand and as she took him into her mouth, she swore she felt HIM tremble. He wasn’t enormous, a good 7 inches but wow that girth…she ached to feel it inside of her.
He grabbed the back of her head and fucked her mouth, gagging her, but not so much as to make her vomit. She loved it anyway, rough sex was her thing. His cock was so thick, she loved the way it felt in her mouth, she moaned, and so did he. They lay on the grass, missionary. They undressed and he eyed her from above.
“Wow baby, you are a queen among women aren’t you?” He said, admiring her porcelain skin, her perfectly round C cup breasts with erect pink nipples.
It was unseasonably warm for close to Halloween, but she still had goosebumps. There wasn’t much conversation, his eyes said everything, he wanted her, she wasn’t some random female, he liked her. He was stunned by her beauty, her curves, he had to be inside of her. As much as he wanted to fuck her, he wanted to do it slowly, passionately.
He knelt between her legs and bent down to moisten her already wet pussy. She moaned, and bucked her hips into his face. Once again he fingered her, slowly, making her legs shake. If he was that good with his fingers…she could only imagine. He took them out and made her suck her juices from his fingers, coming down to meet her mouth with a warm kiss. They shared her taste.
He probed her hood with his tip, running it the length of her slit until finally pushing into her. She felt her pussy widen to accept his girth and she let out a loud moan. She began to tremble, legs shaking as she put them around his waist. He drove into her, then pulled out slowly before slamming into her again. Each time he did this, she cried out, not in pain, but pleasure.
“Fuck me Vic.” She pleaded.
He began to fuck her, hard. She draped her legs around his waist to hold on. He reached a hand down to her neck and began to choke her lightly, testing the waters.
She licked her lips and bucked her hips, riding his cock and feeling her pussy widen to accept his thick cock. He fingered her clit while he fucked her, making her squirm and cry out in surprise.
He grinned at her, and pulled out.
“Ride me baby.” He demanded. She obeyed and slid his cock into her, letting it all the way inside, and began to ride. Rachel leaned back and slid her hips up and down, watching his cock spread her open over and over. She began to shake and he held her close, she wanted to cum so badly. He must’ve heard her thoughts. He licked his fingers, reached down and thumbed her clit as she rode him. She came hard, screaming into his neck, smelling his cologne again…motor oil and pomade. She trembled and as he picked her up, they made eye contact, and he kissed her deeply.
