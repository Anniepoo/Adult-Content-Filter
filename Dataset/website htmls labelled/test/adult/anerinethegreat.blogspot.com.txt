Espresso Maker
Buying the Right Espresso Maker If getting to the corner coffee shop is getting too expensive or the counter worker is making you a triple size espresso when he sees your face coming true the door, you know you need to go shopping for your own espresso maker. It has become so popular the last 10 years we hardly make our own coffee any more, we buy and we buy and a whole industry is build around our coffee needs. Every penny helps and with buying your own espresso maker you can save many penny'sWhat kind of espresso maker do you need?You need to do your research when you are looking to buy a espresso maker for your home because there are two different kinds of machines. If you are just drinking espresso occasionally than it doesn't make sense to buy such a expensive kind of espresso maker like the pump driven one. You even need to consider if you will be better of buying at the coffee corner shop. - removable drip trays - are they easy to clean?So before you decide what espresso maker you want to buy, look first if it will actually fit.So if you have friends, family or even co workers who have their own espresso maker at home, invite your self to their homes and try them out. Automatic Espresso MakerIf you are one of the many people who like to start their day out in the morning with a fresh, hot cappuccino or espresso than bringing your own automatic espresso maker into your home may be an alternative to stopping at the coffee shop. An automatic espresso maker is just that, automatic. Hot Water Under PressureOne of the basic differences between an automatic espresso maker and an automatic coffee maker is that espresso is made with hot water under pressure. Coffee, on the other hand, is made with hot water that is allowed to percolate through the grounds.Finely Ground Coffee BeansAlso, an automatic espresso maker uses coffee that has been ground to a fine powder. This means that you will need to get yourself a coffee bean grinder that is able to produce this type of powdered coffee. Remember to check the package when you buy your beans because espresso beans tend to be of a more darker roast.The more features that your automatic espresso maker has, the more there are to malfunction.The Role Of The Espresso MakerThe popularity of coffee is evident in the forever changing inventions and innovations designed to improve the taste and the whole coffee making experience. Coffee makers over the last forty years have progressed at an extraordinary rate, and the choice available today is astonishing. Most people will understand that boiling water and coffee is not a good combination. Add to this the fact that the coffee grounds were used multiple times and you will understand the taste produced was not ideal. A couple of spoons of coffee grounds were placed on filter paper and just off the boil water slowly passed over them and through the paper, dripping into a glass jug below. Developments in this particular method included ready made coffee and filter paper sachets in various shapes, and adjustments to the filter machines to ensure the even spread of water over all the grounds. The 1990s saw the advent of the espresso maker in the US. Already a favorite in Europe, the fashionable strong dark liquid became a popular after dinner treat and various machines were introduced to make the perfect espresso. Espresso is made from a finely ground dark roast, producing a distinctive flavor. The addition of frothy warm milk to espresso to produce either a cappuccino or latte meant further expansion of the coffee maker industry and made coffee available to a wider variety of tastes. A simple coffee making method that graces many European dining tables is the plunger. The coffee is placed in a glass jug, and nearly boiling water added to it. Water was placed in a copper container and the ground coffee added directly. Don't be afraid to experiment to be sure your chosen machine produces coffee suitable to your tastes before you make that purchase.

Espresso Machines
Espresso MachinesAn espresso machine. Espresso machines make espresso a much simpler beverage to create by controlling the temperature precisely.There are several different types of espresso machines available, each functioning in a different manner. There are piston-driven espresso machines, semi-automatic machines, and automatic espresso machines.Bezzera acquired a patent for his machine and in 1903 these first espresso machines were sold in Europe.These machines were not easy to use. In 1935 Illy invented a coffee maker that used compressed air instead of steam, thus solving the problem of exploding espresso makes. His machine gave a more favorable, stable result.The lever action espresso machine was invented by Achille's Gaggia in 1945 and still today bears his name. Both the Illeta and Gaggia versions of espresso machines are available on the market today.Illy continued to expand and simplify his espresso machine by combining the best parts of other makers.Piston Driven Espresso MachinesPiston-driven espresso machines are more authentic than any other espresso machine. It is the most primitive of the espresso machines. The piston-driven espresso machine uses a lever that is pumped by the operator to force pressure onto hot water, driving it through the coffee grinds. The piston driven espresso is also how the crema came to be a part of espresso.Espresso drinkers who also value authenticity tend to opt for the piston-driven machine. Advancements in technology that brought the semi-automatic and the automatic espresso machine made the piston-driven machine obsolete.In addition to the types of espresso machines are the uses for the machine. If the espresso machine is intended for home use then the cost is going to be decreased significantly. Home espresso makers should be purchased with longevity in mind. For occasional use, a home espresso maker will suffice.Commercial espresso makers can be plumbed to a water source or be manually filled - another cost to consider when looking into espresso makers. The more automated the machine the higher the cost.Shopping for Commercial Espresso MachinesIf you are starting your own coffee shop then you know that your main purchase is going to be your coffee makers and your espresso machines. The espresso machine will get more use than the coffee maker, simply because so many of the drinks you sell will be espresso based.
As you are looking into commercial espresso machines you also need to decide if you are going to need a one-group or two-group machine or more. TypesSemi-automatic machines require the user to shut the steam off manually. This can make producing a consistent shot of espresso difficult.Automatic espresso machines have a cut-off timer and produce a more consistent espresso. Super-automatic espresso machines do everything for you. If offered, buy an extended warranty. Before your purchase the machine, ask about repairs.
De-liming a machine is an expensive task.Buying a commercial espresso machine is a huge investment that should be done with careful consideration to every aspect of the machine and to all the aspects of your business. Choose carefully and wisely for the best espresso bar in town. The Best Espresso MachinesThe Capresso Espresso ProKrupsAlready known for its other coffee makers, the Krups Novo 3000 is a bare bones espresso maker. At other times the espresso came out watery or bitter.All in all, the machine is ahead of steam driven machines but espresso enthusiasts will want to opt for a more reliable, albeit more expensive model.Starbuck BaristaWhile there are more expensive brands that produce richer espressos, the Barista does make an excellent choice.The Gaggia, named for one of the early inventors of the espresso machines.
That could account for why this machine makes such a great espresso with a very thick, wonderful crema.
Espresso machines are basically like most every other product; you get what you pay for. A $50 machine off the local chain store’s shelf won’t produce a quality espresso more than a few times, if at all.
