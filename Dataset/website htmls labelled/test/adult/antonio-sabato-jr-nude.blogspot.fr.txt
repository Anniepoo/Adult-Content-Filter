'Testosterone', with Antonio Sabato Jr., meanders pointlessly
'Testosterone' meanders pointlessly - 12/17/04: "At this year's Toronto International Film Festival, it seemed that every other movie screened was about gay relationships, gay problems, abuse of gaysor gay people being just plain gay in the real world. All of which was fine. The problem is, virtually all these films were junk.
'Testosterone' was one of those films and it is indeed junk, a pointless, wandering tale of obsession that seems to have little purpose beyond showing that gay characters can be in a messed-up movie too.
Dean Seagrave (David Sutcliffe) is a graphic novelist who had one big success, but can't come up with a follow-up. Right now he's searching for his boyfriend Pablo (Antonio Sabato Jr.), who left their apartment a couple of weeks ago to get cigarettes and never came back. "

Review of 'Testosterone', starring Antonio Sabato Jr.
Zap2it.com MOVIES | REVIEWS | REVIEW: "Antonio Sabato Jr. is breaking guys hearts all over the place as he plays a rather sexy mysterious boyfriend in this dramatic 'Testosterone.'
David Sutcliffe plays Sabato's boyfriend and they seem to have an idyllic and open relationship in Los Angeles, until one day the Latin lover disappears without a trace when going out the door for a pack of smokes.
Sutcliffe's wisecracking editor of his graphic novels (like cartoon books) is the always fabulous Jennifer Coolidge (from the 'Legally Blonde' films). They have a particularly funny scene at an art show that is as obnoxious as they usually seem from the outside looking in, but it's where the mother of the missing Latin boyfriend shows up, and it gives Sutcliffe's character the only chance to find his lost love."

Review: Testosterone, with Antonio Sabato Jr.
ChicagoPride.com Events: Reeling: Testosterone: "Dean Seagrave (David Sutcliffe), a brilliant graphic novelist with writer's block, hasn't been himself lately. Not long ago his sex-bomb Argentine lover Pablo (Antonio Sabato, Jr.) left their California beach house on a cigarette run, and hasn't been seen since. Unable to work, sleep or even drag a razor across his face, Dean does what any self-respecting romantic would do in this situation: he blows off his deadline, throws some clothes in a bag and books a flight to Argentina. Destination: Closure. Once in Buenos Aires, Dean tries to track down his beloved Pablo, but this proves more difficult than he anticipated. In addition to the language barrier, Dean gradually discovers that practically everyone he encounters - from Pablo's domineering mother (Sonia Braga) to the beautiful cafe owner Sofia (Celina Font), all the way to a guy he picks up in a bookstore (Leonardo Brzezicki) - is not what they seem."

All form, little content in the shaky 'Testosterone', starring Antonio Sabato Jr.
Alameda Times-Star Online - Bay Area Living: "THE protagonist of 'Testosterone,' a shaky comic noir larded with soft-core sex, is a successful graphic novelist with writer's block.
Ambling around, delivering wisecracks in the genial raised-eyebrow style of James Garner telling a yarn, Dean Seagrave (David Sutcliffe), who narrates the film, hardly acts like a man with a broken heart. He insists, nevertheless, that the overnight disappearance of Pablo (Antonio Sabato Jr.), his live-in boyfriend of 10 months, has left him devastated.
Dean may not be dislikable, but he's annoyingly shallow. His description of his loss sounds more like a petulant whine of hurt pride over the loss of an A-list cutie (Sabato used to be a Calvin Klein underwear model) than a cry of despair. "

Review of "Testosterone", starring Antonio Sabato Jr.
Gay Film Reviews: "Former Calvin Klein model Antonio Sabato Jr steams up the screen as the gay Argentinean lover of equally sexy David Sutcliffe in Testosterone, a dark comedy from director David Morton.
Dean Seagrave (Sutcliffe), a brilliant graphic novelist with writer's block, hasn't been himself lately. Not long ago his sex-bomb Argentine lover Pablo (Sabato, Jr.) left their California beach house on a cigarette run, and he hasn't been seen since. This exodus is particularly complicated for Dean because Pablo was meant to be the answer to all of Dean's problems. That was the plan, anyway."

Southern Voice Online: ""A Dirty Shame" Waters' latest trashfest stars Tracey Ullman as a bored housewife who becomes a sex addict after a concussion. The film garnered an NC-17 rating for its explicit sexual content, so it's bound to be pure classless fun.

"Merci Docteur Rey" A closeted gay man witnesses the murder of his long-lost father, who is killed during a sexual tryst. Dianne Wiest stars as the young man's diva opera singer mother and Vanessa Redgrave portrays herself."
