Why I Get Tested.
Here's a newbie's story! I always assumed that getting tested for HIV was a long drawn out process, an awkward experience that would warrant disgusted facial expressions from nurses and worry and uncertainty from my friends.However these days, getting tested is about as painful as getting a flu shot! And with the technology available today, finding out your result's takes as quick as 10 minutes. Regardless of your results, you can bet there are many support groups available! So make yourself a priority and get tested. Remember you have one mind, one body, and one life protect and love yourself.

Home HIV testing?
We often get folks calling in to ask about home HIV testing versus coming into our office. Here is a great article I found that talks about the cons of getting a home test.

CVS Locking Up condoms...
I could understand they don't want folks to steal them but why do this only in communitites of color? Nice way to be health concious. I found this article today..Here is a teaser from POZ blog..Change to Win, a coalition of labor unions, believes that CVS’s practice of locking up condoms at certain stores—commonly in communities of color—creates a barrier to access for young people who are less likely to ask a store associate for them, The Tennessean reports. The group asserts that CVS’s anti-theft policy puts those communities at risk for unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV.
