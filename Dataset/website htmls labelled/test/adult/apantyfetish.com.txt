And 15% off all Hair products …Read on!
Hello guys, I hope you are all doing well, as I have some exciting new annoucments to share with you all! I know its been a while since my last update but I have been busy making some huge improvement to a lot of our products and adding several new ones.
Packaging upgrades – I know a lot of you had a problem with our old shipping ‘bubble wrap’ packaging – some of you reported damage when the conents arrived – Eco-Earth has addressed this issue by replacing all our old packaging with new, strong, sturdy boxes.
This should prevent any damage or delay to all orders from now on. Best of all Eco-Earth will be paying for the boxes so this will not effect the shipping cost, it will remain the same.
New shaving creams – We now have a great range of all natural shaving creams! These creams are made with natural oils and herbs and come in neat 50ml tubs; all with their own little origami styled box and some skin triva. These natural shaving creams are not only soft on the skin but also naturally help protect you from razor burn; while also acting as a powerful moisturizer.
New Shampoos & Conditioners – A lot of you wanted a bigger range of natural and organic shampoos and conditioners for a bigger range of hair types. As a lot of you did not like our old shampoo we have revamped the entire design and contents based on the feedback you left us.
We are now stocking a great natural range of shampoos and conditioners for many different hair types; including oily, dry, sensitive, normal and many more! All our bottles have been replaced with simple round-pump-action bottles for easy use and all our labels have been redesigned for clarity as well.
New lip balms – As our lip balms are one of our most popular products we are now stocking a bigger range including; Tea Tree, Peppermint, Orange and many others all crafted with only natural oils.
New skin creams – Our old excavating skin cream has been replaced with a richer, softer avocado cream (made with himyalan salt) we also now have a great range of natural skin creams including mango, aloe vera, coconut milk and a few others – all of which are made with only the best natural ingredients!
Final Note –  A few of you have been having trouble getting in contact with me via the ‘contact us’ page; this issue has now been fixed and emails should go through normally now, remember you can also call us with the details found on the ‘contact’ page which can be found on all product pages. I also want to take this chance to thank each and every one of you for supporting Eco-Earth and helping us spread the word about natural products! Every sale brings us to a greener, brighter world.
*Remember that 5% of every sale supports the Rainforest Alliance.
For 15% off all Hair Care products use the code: ‘HairCare‘ during checkout; this offer will end on the 30th December 2015.

Firstly…
When I set up Eco-Earth several years ago; I wanted a company with a bit of humanity and good will behind it, I put a lot of effort into my products and research and honestly want to give you guys the best I possibly can. I have had a few nasty comments regarding my 5 – 7 day delivery time and wanted to remind these people that I am a one man show, I have no marketing team, research team, admin or anyone to help with packaging – it is just me which will mean the package will take slightly longer to arrive but I wanted to assure you guys I will listen to any feedback good or bad and do my best to keep everyone happy.
Refunds
A few people have requested infomation regarding refunds this is stated in our terms, but generally I am very fair in regards to refunds if a customer is not happy all they need to do is email me and I’ll refund them within 1 working day, you can also contact me directly on: (+44) 07583174148
Updates on our organic/natural shampoo
I’ve been listening to a lot of feedback regarding my organic/natural shampoo and many of you were unhappy with how water ‘thin’ it was; you will all be pleased to know after many late nights and experimenting I have finally created a new natural and organic two in one shampoo, which is naturally thick, with Zero surfactants, bonding agents, or any crap of any sort. I am now using thicker (natural & organic) castile soap. I have had to change the recipe slighly, but the product remains the same – I have also PH balanced the product to help protect the hairs mantle.
Some of you also did not like the bottles I was using; so I have changed the design of the product – which now comes in a round long bottle and a pump, this new natural design will take place just before christmas.
Update on our natural toothpaste
Our natural toothpaste used to come in a small (30ml) tube – which was annoying for some who were ordering 10 or 15 of them – a lot of people were requesting bigger containers. I am sorry it took so long to get this sorted guys, but we now finally have 2 new different ways to send out our natural toothpaste which is:
In a container like this, each container is 50ml
In a spout bag which holds 100ml
We also now have two new types of natural toothpastes to pick from; Remineralizing Toothpaste & Aloe Vera: Coconut natural toothpaste; our entire selection can be found in our natural toothpaste section (oral health in cosmetics)
Eco-Earth is now proudly supporting Rainforest Alliance a charity which focues on protecting our little blue planet and finding better ways of living on earth without harming it. For every sale made here at Eco-Earth, I will donate 5% – 15% to these guys. I will also be taking steps to make Eco-Earth better by introducing eco-packaging and non-toxic all natural ingredients.
New natural perfumes and aftershave on the way!
Using natural oils, I have created some really nice smelling perfumes with no toxic ingredients. These new natural perfumes and aftershaves will be here very soon.
10% everything!
This coupon can be used on all natural products, at any value. To use this code, simply go to checkout and type in: “NonToxic” for 10% off the total checkout price; this code expires on the 30th November 2015.

15% Off All Aromatherapy Products

15% off all aromatherapy products!
Running from the 1st November – 15th November we will be taking off 15% off all our aromatherapy products; this includes our famous massage oils, lavender cushions and our essential oils. To get this offer use the code; “wellbeing” during checkout. For those of you who are new to massage, we recommend this channel for some great videos explaining how to use massage oils, and how to perfom basic massages. Remember all our products are made with zero chemicals and only the very best of oils!
New tea on the way!
We are also going to be offering a new range of teas which include; black, herbal, green, white, fruit and many more! Some of these teas will be directly imported from china (who we believe are the king of tea makers) We will also be creating remedy tea; and don’t worry about the taste these fine teas will be like nothing you have ever tasted or seen before (very exotic) we are also very excited to be working closely with Tea-Asia, who will be supplying us with all the best tea (from local chinese farmers) to us. Most of our tea will be in loose form, so bare that in mind.
New incense and holders
We are increasing our range of exotic incense! Most of our incense is imported from India, and crafted using tree resin. Incense is an ancient form of apothacary which was used (mostly in churches) for its powerful, refreshing scent. The tree resin gives off a smoky haze which is very useful for destorying potent smells. We will now be offering cones, new sticks and gift sets as well. We will also be stocking holders.
New Spa towels and candles
Finally we will also be stocking new scented candles (zero chemicals, as you would expect) and a range of premium spa towels. We hope you are excited as we are! I wanted to take this opportunity  to thank each and every one of you for helping to make Eco-Earth a reailty; our goal is and always will be to offer 100% natural products without any of the nasty chemicals.

I just wanted to let you guys know that I am still alive! I know I have not posted for a while now as I have been so busy trying to get more natural products on here for you guys, we have more soaps and an awesome range of shower gels now! My job is not easy, and I find blogging very hard; dyslexia has always been a huge struggle for me which means I always need to have a dictionary at hand – and my mum to double check what I write to ensure I don’t make any silly spelling errors! I wanted to let you guys know how inspiring your comments on my animal testing post are to me. After a hard day at work it is so nice to come back and read all the lovely comments you guys leave so thank you all very much! I understand some of you are requesting more interaction i.e. more social content and it is something I am looking into, but as I am so busy with everything else it will take some time before I can make any big changes to the design.
A lot of people have requested I post a bit more info about me – I have a page you guys can visit to learn more about who I am – but my mission here at Eco-Earth is to get chemicals out of our products, put an end to animal testing and help protect the environment.
I’ve always been very considerate of our big blue world, respecting things for what they are; I can remember my mother taking me shopping for toothpaste and wondering what the ingredients were, but even she didn’t know! A common theme that a lot of people seem to follow, the average person does not know what is inside the products they buy – they just trust it blindly and this is very sad, atleast it was for me.
Although so much is being done to help protect our little blue planet, I do not feel enough is being done – so many people seem to forget that we all share this world together and pumping it with harmful plastics, chemicals and pointless animal testing (all for vainity) is just unnecessary in so many levels – but it is profit and human greed that drives all this forward, its OK to poision our world because their company hits record sales, its OK to pump us all with chemicals because it is cheap, and its OK to harm animals because they will die anyway. But what makes me sad, is that no one seems to want to help, or care – atleast; people seem to care for a time then simply forget altogether! Even big charitys that claim to help are all in it for profit, heck I used to be in an office (old job) that was only in it for the sales/money (donation) and didn’t care about the chairty!
I was tired of doing nothing, and tired of waiting – so I set up Eco-Earth; I set out to try and make a change and swore to only promote products which were not harming our world, not animal testing and NOT pumping us with chemicals, that is the core of Eco-Earth and that is my mission and I wanted to let you guys know that I will not rest until big brands listen to us. I know it sounds like a battle we could never win, but us – the people are so powerful we can make change. From time to time we do get small victories; cocate have said they will now be making fluoride free toothpaste and big brands are now making SLS free products.

Ancient art of oil pulling
Posted on 22nd September 2015
by
Tommy
Reply
Mouthwash has become the norm for those who are in a rush in the morning and is often treated as a ‘quick oral clean’. You guys know I am not a fan of chemical mouthwashes for many reasons. It is difficult to find a good mouthwash which does the job without using cleaning chemicals though, right?
As it turns out this is not so true, and as silly as this may sound (don’t freak out) bare with me – because it does work, I myself have had a lot of success with this, as have a lot of others I have spoken to. The technique I am going to be showing you guys is called ‘oil pulling’ it is an old Indian remedy and on paper sounds vert crude but in reailty makes a lot of sense. The process involves getting a good high fat oil (I use coconut oil) holding it in the mouth for 10 – 15 mins, then spitting it out – I’m not kidding. So why on earth would you do this? To explain I need to show you guys how a basic soap works.
A bar of soap is nothing more than a bar of ‘fat’ and the reason it is so effective at cleaning is because bacteria loves fat – it sticks to it like glue, coconut oil is the same. Everytime you oil pull you are effectively pulling out a lot of harmful bacteria directly from the mouth, infact oil pulling is so good many even claim it can reverse and even stop tooth decay dead in its tracks. Oil pulling is no question a deeper and more natural clean compared to most typical mouthwashes on the market today.
So do I have to do it for 10 – 15 mins – and does it have to be coconut oil? Yes, 10 mins should be minimum, this is because it takes a while for the oil to pull out all the bacteria as it is a slow process, but it works very well and in just one week I promise you guys, you will see the results. Any oil can be used as long as the oil has a high fat content, it’ll work – I say coconut oil as honestly it is the best tasting oil compared to say raw vegetable oil (yuck).
If you guys decide to give oil pulling a go, let me know how you get on in the comments below! We would all love to hear from you.

The many benefits of music
Posted on 20th September 2015
by
Tommy
Reply
Music comes in all shapes and sizes; from rock to classical, instrumentals to pop etc… etc… Music is universal and can be found all over the world.
A dancing tribe in Africa
But did you know that music comes with its own range of benefits; besides making us feel better after a stressful day?
Music is proven to increase sleep quailty
A lot of research has gone into the effects of music on the brain – the calming effects of music (which helps the body relax) may help to release the sleep hormone Melatonin, this hormone is what makes you ‘feel’ tired. The calming effect music has on the brain will also boost sleep quailty.
Helps the brain fight off infections and viruses
Research has shown that music reduces the ‘stress’ hormone cortisol which has a negative impact on the immune system increasing the risk of heart disease,  cause mild problems with memory and effect blood pressure. To counter this, it is recommended you listen to 50 minutes of good up lifting music in a calm environment.
Reduces depression & anxiety
Research in Drexel found that people who listen to music on a daily basis found it easier to cope with depression and anxiety. Music also improved there overall mood levels had a good impact on psyche and  general wellbeing.
Exercise for the brain
Remember that saying ‘if you don’t use it you lose it?’  well music is a great work out for the brain which keeps everything working and healthy which in turn can help prevent a whole host of mental diseases such as dementia, and slow down the ageing process of the brain greatly.
So how does the tone of music effect us?
Happy, sad, fast, slow and even scary music all effects the brain in a different way.
Sad music – We are likely to mimic the song via a face expression, either happy, or neutral depending on the ‘mood’ of the song. This means we find it very easy to connect with a song without knowing much about it. Sad music makes it more sympathetic and understanding; it also helps open us up making us easier to talk to.
Ambient music – Studies suggest that this type of music can help us be more creative; or come up with creative ideas. If you are writing or studying this is the music you should be listening to. Lightning, temperature and the environment you are in also play a vital roll in the level of creativity you express.
Research also suggests that music can play a small part in our younger years in defining our personailty and identity, depending on the type of music, the mood, theme and duration.
Let me know what type of music you listen to in the comments below – and how it makes you feel.

Soaps, Soaps, Soaps!

Eco-Earth now has its own range of amazing natural soaps made with zero harmful chemicals. These premium soaps come in 140g bars and are made by hand using high quailty olive oil instead of the cheap oils most other soaps use.
Remember you get a free gift for every £20 spent in our store. You will also get a free bar of soap for every 5 bars you buy from us. Just make sure to tell us what bar you would like in the comments section of the checkout otherwise it will be random. You will also earn Eco-Points as well, which can also be used at checkout to further discount products.
These soaps can also be used as a great high end moisturizer for all skin types as well, as being a gentle exfoliator. Here is a quick overview of some of our soaps.
Charcoal Detox
This dark soap is made with real real charcoal. A great natural detox for the skin. This soap is great for deep cleaning, and drawing out impurities from the pours of the skin. This soap also makes a great kitchen soap.
Elgent Rose
One of our most popular bars, made with fresh rose petals. Often desribed as ‘aromatherapeutic’ this classic soap makes a great all rounded soap. And can be used for all skin types and colours. Definitely giving this bar a go first if you are unsure, it smells great and looks great!
You can find our full range of soaps in the soap & bath section of the website.
I would like to take this chance to thank everyone for supporting us. Eco-Earth would not be possible without any of you guys! Natural and organic products will always be our main focus. We are also in the process of making a new aloe vera toothpaste, and shower scrubs which should be up soon.
For those of you who have tried our soaps, please let us know how you got on! We would love to hear from you and any feedback is greatly appreciated.

Natural remedy for: eye strain
Posted on 17th September 2015
by
Tommy
Reply
This natural remedy is great for tired, dry, irriated, infected and sore eyes. I’d like to point out, that although many brands of eye spray and eye wash contain chemicals; they are not harmful, unlike other chemicals found in cosmetic products. I understand though that some people want to go 100% natural/organic, which is fine – which is why I think you guys will like this natural remedy.
You will need
Himalayan salt (can be found in most health shops)
Distilled water (ideally, or mineral water if you can’t get it)
Honey (Any type of honey will work)
A jar or a pot (to store the remedy)
You guys are probably thinking, ‘salt! In the eye! Are yee mad?’ If I was using normal table salt I would agree, it is mad – but himalayan salt comes directly from the himalyan mountains and is full of vital trace minerals which are very good for the eyes, unlike chemically made table salt. Himalyan salt also has many other benefits and can be used as a natural salt scrub, or natural hand wash (with organic soap).
A bowl of fine salt’
To make this remedy
Pour in 10 – 20ml of water into a bowl (or container)
Add in roughly half a tea spoon of honey into the water (no more otherwise the spray will be too sticky to use)
Finally add in a very, very small pinch of the salt – too much can cause further irritation to the eye.
Mix the contents until the water becomes clear
You are done!
This natural remedy can also be used as an eye wash as well – just bare in mind it only has a very short life of around 2 – 3 weeks, so it is better to make it in small batches. The reason for the short life is due to the salt crystallizing in the water.
If you are struggling to find any of the above ingredients a quick Google search should reveal a few shops which sell them, you can also get the salt from us.
If you are going to try this natural remedy, let us know how you get on in the comments below! Or maybe you have a natural remedy already? If so, we would all love to hear.

What is the big fuss over chemicals?
Posted on 15th September 2015
by
Tommy
1
Laws and rules were put in place to protect us from harm and keep us safe, and although they do a great job of keeping order and peace (most of the time) they are far from perfect.
A common mistake people make is that laws protect us from harm; this is not always the case however. Bad things happen all the time, people die or get hurt. Shady things happen behind factory doors for the sake of profit and pressure. So why is it so hard for people to believe that cosmetic products are a health hazard?
The back of a bottle of shampoo
It is a sad day when people blindly accept what they are given like a zombie, because they believe that big brands care about their health. Eco-Earth was set up to change that; to promote natural and organic products, get these things out of our brands and give people the chance to wake up and stop supporting this dangrous practice. Our market is riddled with things which are bad for us (i.e. smoking).
I know the media is always throwing things in our face saying this is bad, that is bad, don’t eat this, don’t drink this etc… And I am aware people are getting a little sick of it; but most of the things which are put into our products are not necessary and are there for the sole sake of prolonging shelf life, changing colour or to increase performance at a budget. All this comes at a huge risk to our health, our childrens health and the wellbeing of many animals.
It doesn’t need to be like that guys, it really doesn’t – I strongly believe natural products are the way forward, no chemicals, no testing and no health hazards. That is why I support Eco-Earth, that is why I try so hard to promote natural and organic brands and why I work day and night until I know that these unnecessary chemicals are taken out of our products.
‘I smoked all my life, and am still alive – at 85. But this was my choice; as I’m sure it was for many others too, but I know it doesn’t make smoking healthy, just because you feel fine doesn’t make it right to force everyone to be medicated by the same copy-paste chemical soups. One day that bottle of shampoo just might be the thing to trigger your cancer, and the doctors will blame it on genetics, not your shampoo’
–Sam, an internet friend
