Spring Where Are You?
Oops, the date is wrong on this one, and I don't remember the right date, it was back in 2013
It's still windy, cold and cloudy here today.  I'm so wanting some warm weather!  The locust tree is starting to get some buds, so it thinks spring is almost here, hope it's right!
We took three of John's sculptures down to the Heritage center this morning.  One, gearhead, had a weld break on the trip down, so he had to come home for some repairs.  Rambo and Fraiser Crane are in place.  I'm going to miss Fraiser, we've had him the longest.

Chamber Mixer
The low was all the way up to 7.3 last night and it's warmer today.  Feels so good to have some warm weather!
We attended the Chamber mixer today.  Greg called John and asked us to come today because he was going to be doing a presentation on the upcoming display from the Smithsonian.  Greg asked John and I to help set it up.  I signed up to be a docent today, sounds like it could be interesting. The display will be here in August and September.

I'm freezing!
The low last night was 1.2.   I think our cold days are coming straight from the North Pole!  Burr, I'm so ready for some warm weather.  I don't know if it's colder this winter, or if I'm just feeling it more, but I don't seem to get warmed up.
I had tomatoes and peppers still growing in the greenhouse, but they have given it up during this cold weather, I guess it's getting down close enough to freezing in there to kill them.  Celery, carrots and onions are still okay and I planted some peas the other day.  Last year, they did fine and I planted them a bit earlier than this, I think.
We walked a mile today!  It's been a long, long time since we've walked.  I tried it the other day, but it was just too cold and I only made it as far as Sam's dog cages.  Today we waited until 2 to start and it was all the way up to 36 degrees.  I was  bundled up like a mummy to keep my face warm going out with the breeze in our faces, but was plenty warm coming back home.
I rode out to the dump with John this afternoon.  On the way home we spotted an elk heading the same way we were traveling and John matched our speed to the elk's while I snapped away.  We turned off on a side road and got close enough to see the animal's breath!  So cool!

The world can go on, I found Twinkies!!
We got a bit of snow last night and more low temps, it was -7 degrees, burrr!!!
Hey, Little Debbie is making twinkies!  I was so sad when I heard that Hostess was going under and I don't even like twinkies, but the thought of never being able to see or eat another one was still depressing!  Now I don't have to be sad anymore, Little Debbie to the rescue!
I wonder if ammo is getting hard to get?
The veggies all ready for the taco salad.
And the finished salad.

It's Too Cold!
I was going to walk this morning, bundled up and started out, but only got as far as Sam's dog cages.  It was just too cold!  My face was freezing even with it all wrapped up, so I turned around and came back.  I did stop and talk to the horses a bit.  And, it was warmer last night, it was all the way up to1.2 degrees, ha ha!
I planted some pea seeds in the greenhouse today.
John helped me clean out all the dead bean plants, tomato plants and basil a while back.

Freezing weather = warm oatmeal!
The low last night was -8 degrees!  That's cold!  Here's John's gear-head guy whizzing through the snow.
My breakfast warm oatmeal and hot cocoa!
Frost on our window.
John was going to put new rub rail on his pontoon boat and the project has grown, he ended up taking of the deck so he could paint the pontoons and he drcided to replace the carpet on the deck, too.

Cold weather and a fire
It got down to 3 degrees last night and they say it's going to be colder than that this coming week! Yuck, no fun!
Lunch was leftover pork from yesterday.  We made it more like mock tacos and put fritos in the bottom of the bowl and put Pace Picante on top.  I like it better this way.
Mom and Carleen stopped in for a bit, they were up to pick up prescriptions.  They wanted to see the new shelves, I haven't gotten things arranged like I want yet, but stuff is on the shelves now.  The room looks much better, but I haven't gotten all the stuff we took out put back yet, I also need to finish putting the stuff back in the bedroom we took out when we had the flood.  It's a never ending thing, LOL!  And I'm so slow these days, between my weak back and my hurting shoulder, I don't move very fast.
Carleen said they'd noticed a fire on the way here, so after they left we went to see what was burning.  It was a building in front of the catholic church.  Don't know if it was on purpose or not.
We got more snow this afternoon, it's cold outside!

Snow!
We got snow last night, not much, just a light skiff.
I couldn't get Dr. Tenney's office on the phone this morning, so we just showed up first thing.  They took me right in and Courtney checked out my tooth.  Whew, it was just the back part of the temporary crown that broke off.  I was so scared I was going to have to have another crown put in!
Ken Green showed up this mornig to see what's up with our internet.
He put in a new modem, but it didn't fix the problem.
Turned out it was a problem at their end, in the building that hooks us up.  He left me his business card and said to call him and not tech support next time we have a problem!  Sounds good to me.
Temperature at 11 pm, 10 degrees, burr!  They say we're in for some cold weather, I thought we'd been having that since December, not looking forward to colder than we've had!

Out and About
My breakfast was leftover meat from yesterday on homemade toast with an egg on top.
Sunrise
Today was a busy day, we made a deposit, went shopping and ate out this evening.
We've not seen The Roost open for a while now, guess Kelly couldn't make a go of it by herself!
John had the fried chicken dinner and I had a fried chicken wrap at Trail Riders tonight.
Yumm!
As we were watching TV tonight I was eating a cookie and felt something hard, so I took it out and it was either a piece of my temporary crown or a tooth!
Bummer, guess I'll be at the dentist's first thing tomorrow!  We lost our internet this evening while we were at dinner.  I tried unplugging the modem, and the router, but it doesn't fix.  I called tech support and they are going to send someone out tomorrow, probably around 6 pm, they said.
