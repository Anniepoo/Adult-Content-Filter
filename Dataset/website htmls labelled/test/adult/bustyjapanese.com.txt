Backup My Website to Synology via LFTP
Posted on December 29, 2015 by me
There is no FTP in Synology, so I have to use LFTP
Here is my backup.sh
#!/bin/bash -vx
lftp -u username,password ftp.xxx.com<<END_SCRIPT
mirror -c -e –parallel=10 /remote_address /destiny_address
exit
END_SCRIPT
If you see “lftp –> Fatal error: Certificate verification: Not trusted” , you can follow this link or the steps below to fix it:
Create the .lftp directory with the command : mkdir /root/.lftp
Create and edit the rc file with the command : vi /root/.lftp/rc
Press ‘i’ for edit mode
Add the line : set ssl:verify-certificate no
Exit edit mode by pressing Escape (twice)
Close and save the file by pressing Z (capital z) twice)
After that I use Synology Task Scheduler to backup my website regularly,
backup.sh | tee -a logfile.text

SCCM UEFI OSD for Surface Pro 3
Posted on September 22, 2015 by me
Surface pro 3 only supports UEFI OSD boot, so unfortunately the regular SCCM BIOS OSD boot didn’t work.
Here is the config you need to setup both UEFI & BIOS boot for SCCM OSD:
For the settings, first need to set two different vender classes,
For UEFI 64 bit machines, vender class is PXEClient:Arch:00007
DHCP 060: PXEClient
DHCP 066: your PXE server address
DHCP 067: smsboot\x64\wdsmgfw.efi
For BIOS 86& 64 machines, vender class is PXEClient:Arch:00000
DHCP 066: your PXE server address
DHCP 067: smsboot\x64\wdsnbp.com
here is a great video on how to set it up on your windows DHCP server:

SCCM Query to Join User Resources and System Resources
Posted on August 25, 2015 by me
Very few information on sccm query to join both user resources and system resources database together. However my manger wants to see the device and is owner’s job title, manger, etc. so I have this sccm script to show all the information needed:
it will list the AD site, computer name, last logon user, user’s full name, email address, job title, department, user’s description, lost logon time stamp, machine SN, machine asset tag ID, operation system name and version, IP address and Mac address. Plus it limited to machine type Lenovo T450s. you can change the filter according to your own needs.
select SMS_R_System.ADSiteName, SMS_R_System.Name, SMS_R_System.LastLogonUserName, SMS_R_User.UniqueUserName, SMS_R_User.FullUserName, SMS_R_User.Mail, SMS_R_User.title, SMS_R_User.manager, SMS_R_User.description, SMS_R_System.LastLogonTimestamp, SMS_G_System_PC_BIOS.SerialNumber, SMS_G_System_SYSTEM_ENCLOSURE.SMBIOSAssetTag, SMS_R_System.OperatingSystemNameandVersion, SMS_R_System.IPAddresses, SMS_R_System.MACAddresses from  SMS_R_System inner join SMS_R_User on SMS_R_System.LastLogonUserName=SMS_R_User.UserName inner join SMS_G_System_COMPUTER_SYSTEM_PRODUCT on SMS_G_System_COMPUTER_SYSTEM_PRODUCT.ResourceID = SMS_R_System.ResourceId inner join SMS_G_System_PC_BIOS on SMS_G_System_PC_BIOS.ResourceId = SMS_R_System.ResourceId inner join SMS_G_System_SYSTEM_ENCLOSURE on SMS_G_System_SYSTEM_ENCLOSURE.ResourceId = SMS_R_System.ResourceId where SMS_G_System_COMPUTER_SYSTEM_PRODUCT.Version like “%T450S%”

here is the sccm query to see device owner by using User Device Affinity.
it will list computer name, the device’s owner, user’s full name, email address, job title, manger name and description( these three needs to manually add to SCCM User Discovery first).
Here is the SCCM Query:
select SMS_R_System.Name, SMS_R_User.UniqueUserName, SMS_R_User.FullUserName, SMS_R_User.Mail, SMS_R_User.title, SMS_R_User.manager, SMS_R_User.description from  SMS_R_User JOIN SMS_UserMachineRelationship ON SMS_UserMachineRelationship.UniqueUserName=SMS_R_User.UniqueUserName JOIN SMS_R_System ON SMS_R_System.Name=SMS_UserMachineRelationship.ResourceName

.Net Framework 4.5.2 SCCM Application Package
Posted on August 11, 2015 by me
I have to say, Microsoft’s .Net framework installation is SOB! so many different settings need to done to get this .net 4.5.2 work in SCCM.
Here is how:
I downloaded the offline installer from MS website, and run this command line for install:
DotNet_4.5.2.exe /q /norestart /ChainingPackage ADMINDEPLOYMENT
In the settings, we need to set Run installation and uninstall program as 32-bit process on 64-bit clients.
For detection method, we use registry entry:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
SOFTWARE\Microsoft\NET Framework Setup\NDP\v4\Full
Release
value greater than or equal to 379893
Now you are ready to deploy!

How to Setup PXE Server for SCCM OSD
Posted on August 5, 2015 by me
Here are some notes from our Microsoft SCCM trainer a few months ago, really helpful on setting up PXE Server.
How to set up Option 66 & Option 67 on the DHCP Server
Open DHCP management console (dhcpmgmt.msc)
Add the server with the subnet you want to configure (i.e. dc01, dc02, etc.)
Expand IPv4
Expand the IP Scope you want to edit for PXE (i.e. 192.168.1.0)
Right-Click Scope Options
Click Configure Options
Check 066 Boot Server Host Name and type the pxe server (i.e. cm01.domain.com)
Check 067 Bootfile Name and type smsboot\x86\wdsnbp.com for the String Value in Data Entry area.
Click OK
Repeat as necessary for other dhcp scopes.
Close DHCP console when all changes are made.
Settings in SCCM
Make sure the enable PXE support for clients is Enabled on the DP (Specifically: Allow the DP to respond to incoming PXE Requests and Enable Unknown computer support.
Make sure there is an x86 AND x64 boot image (NEED BOTH) on the DP/PXE Server, and make sure the box “Deploy this boot image from the PXE-enabled Distribution Point” is checked off in the boot image properties of both images under the Data Source tab.
Also verify the two images are appearing in the \\<DPserver>\<DriveLetter>$\RemoteInstall\SMSImages. You can also check against the SMSPXE.log in <Install Directory>\Program Files\Microsoft Configuration Manager\Logs\SMSPXE.log for errors and if the images are setting properly for PXE.
Deploying the TS to the All Unknown Systems collection
In the deployment of the TS, make sure to select “Only media and PXE” in the Make available to the following (not as important as long as PXE is one of these options).
If testing with unknown computers then make sure computer is unknown/removed from SCCM.
Notes
WDS is not necessary to install previously for PXE to work.
The RemoteInstall folder will automatically be created on one of the drives on the DP. This is necessary for setting up Option 67 on the DHCP Server. The necessary DHCP Options are as follows:
Troubleshooting PXE
If receiving these 2 event IDs for WDS and the service will not start:
513 – An error occurred while trying to initialize provider WDSMC from C:\Windows\system32\wdsmc.dll. Windows Deployment Services server will be shutdown. Error Information: 0x906
257 – An error occurred while trying to start the Windows Deployment Services server.
Error Information: 0x906
then run this command to get WDS service to start working:
WDSUTIL /Initialize-Server /RemInst:D:\RemoteInstall
Might need to uninstall and reinstall PXE. Possible order: uninstall PXE, do the above fix, and then install PXE

SMSTS.log locations (http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb932135.aspx):
Note: Run CMTrace first to set it as the default viewer of logs (located under X:\SMS\Bin\i386\CMTrace) and go to the proper location of SMSTS.log.
System booted in WinPE and the local harddisk is not modified (smsts.log in the “x:\windows\temp\smstslog” folder)
System booted in WinPE and the local harddisk is partitioned and formatted (smsts.log in the “x:\smstslog” folder and after that in the “c:\De_SMSTaskSequence\Logs\Smstslog” folder
System booted in Windows before the ConfigMgr client is installed (smsts.log in the “c:\_SMSTaskSequence\Logs\Smstslog” folder)
System booted in Windows after ConfigMgr client is installed (smsts.log in the “c:\windows\system32\ccm\logs\Smstslog” folder)
(When using a x64 device, you can find it in the “c:\windows\SysWOW64\ccm\logs\Smstslog” folder)
