THE AMAZING ATHEIST
THE AMAZING ATHEIST
This is where people on Tumblr rattle off all of the things that they label themselves so you know where their group allegiances lie, and who am I to break with that empty tradition: I am a human being living in the 21st century, looking for answers and struggling with issues like everyone else. Atheist. Egalitarian. Pervert. Bisexual. Fat Ass. Sexy Ass. God. Slave. Douchebag. Boring piece of shit. Loudmouth. You know what? This is all unnecessary. I'm TJ. How are you?

Personally, I identify as a feminist but I tend to agree with you on most issues. I think that's because I take it to mean the most basic thing, that men and women are equal. Anyway, thanks for your blog and videos because (I'm sure you get this all the damn time) you helped me out a lot coming to terms with and figuring out what I believe (or rather don't).

Yo TJ, what's your favorite System Of A DOWN song and album? (only asking cause huge SOAD fanboy)
Asked by silverflare299
Favorite album is probably ‘Mezmerize.’ Favorite song is a tough one. I know it’s not their most innovative or boldly unique song, but I have an irresistible attraction to 'Old School Hollywood.’

Hey TJ. Lately I've felt like being alive is not the best option. A couple times I've felt such a deep hatred for everyone I think I might blow a blood vessel. I'm forced to waste a part of my life sitting at a desk and in the end, not learning anything. I don't want to waste 3 and a half more year of my life. How did you drop out of school and how did you do it without getting in trouble with the law? And also have you heard NIN and if so what's your favorite song? "Suck" is mine.

You can drop out at 16 with parental consent. Might be different in your state. Check. Looking for solutions is always a better option than giving up.

You sly dog. You kept your Joe Rogan appearance hidden from everyone. Any particular reason?
Asked by ky-sama

I personally call myself a feminist, but I do think it is VERY important to keep an open mind and listen to and respect anti-fem viewpoints because if I don't I fear I'll turn into Anita Sarkeesian...lol. I think people who judge your videos off of what some drama queens on tumblr say behind your back are ignorant as heck. You're a super cool dude.
Asked by tall-lady-elf
Your open-mindedness is refreshing. I hope that more feminists embrace your mindset moving forward.

You where looking surprisingly adorable dressed up all professional like on Joe Rogan's show. I'd suck your dick if you kept that sweatshirt on.
Asked by roushfan5
Sounds like a deal.

You're right TJ. I'm one of your biggest fans, but I think you talk some fucking bullshit 50% of the time.

50/50 is the absolute best range to agree/disagree with someone. No one is more interesting than someone who you never know whether the next thing out of their mouth is going to make you cheer or cringe.
