OUTSTANDING Review for "Pretty Words. Nothing More."
" A short and simple book of poetry that still packs an emotional punch, Andy Martello’s Pretty Words. Nothing More. An Unlikely Book of Poetry is
a brief collection that depicts love, loss, and longing. As the poet
describes in the foreword, this project originated as a series of
Facebook posts that included poems following along with accompanying
images. A future edition of the work will include original artwork.
Martello hopes that the reader will focus on the words alone in this
edition, which create a feeling that titillates the senses. The poems
inside are more or less one long poem separated by breaks, telling the
story of a man and a woman, and the passion they share, and the loss
that can be present when problems arise between two people who feel so
thoroughly connected. The kinds of feelings that come about because of
love and lust are certainly complicated, and Martello does a good job of
expressing all of the different emotions that we as humans face through
his poems.
Martello is clearly a talented writer,
as even from the small amount of content that is within the pages of
this book, it is obvious that he has a way with words. His poetic verses
are succinct, but still powerful. Focusing on duality, and a seemingly
singular relationship between a man and a woman, returning to it through
different lenses again and again, the reader will find themselves
speeding through this book. This is the way poetry should be, playing
with assumptions and turning them on their heads, not over wringing out
words repeatedly to create something completely unknown, but something
new instead. The only problem about this collection is that we wish it
was longer."

Amazon Review of the King of Casinos:
A FASCINATING story!
"This is an easy read because of Andy Martello's style of writing.
It
reads like he's beside you telling the story to you personally.
I have
been interested in Nevada history since my first visit many years ago.
I
had the pleasure to meet Andy and get him to sign his book at a program
at the Nevada State Museum.
Little did I know when I bought the book
that I would have been so caught up in the history of this small Nevada
town known more for its famous senator than anything else.After
finishing the book, I need to go back and see the Clampers monument and
find the area where WIllie's El Rey Club stood.
Perhaps we can get a
group together, rent a backhoe, and look for buried treasure (Sorry,
you'll have to buy the book and read it to join in my quest).It
is a fascinating story how a chance museum tour would lead to a book
like this.
Andy Martello's book keeps you involved.
You can't help but
cheer for Willie and hope for the best!Yes indeed, who knew that Searchlight had so much at one time?"

Amazong review of The king of Casinos: I enjoyed this book IMMENSELY!
"I really enjoyed this book immensely. I've only lived here for 8 years
so it was great learning about some of the history surrounding
Searchlight and looking at all the pictures. This was a very humorous
and enjoyable read."

"Its difficult for me to be objective because.Willie Martello was my
stepfather...and Andy is my friend. On the other hand I can be
judgemental because I have the right. I know how long this has been in
the works and I appreciate Andy's determination.
It.was so fun to read
this..and I loved.Andy's writing style. He is a great storyteller and
this is a great story.
Three cheers Andy Martello..and thank you for
recognizing the man and his mission and bringing him to life ..warts and
all."
