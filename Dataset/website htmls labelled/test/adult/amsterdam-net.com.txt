Usage of cannabis is legal in Amsterdam. You can buy cannabis in small quantities from licensed coffee shops only. Anywhere else and you might get in trouble. Do not buy drugs on the street.
Hard drugs are not permitted by the government so anyone selling you these and telling you they are legal is wrong.
One person within your party should stay sober. You don’t want to end up doing something stupid while you are high or intoxicated.
You have to be 18 to buy cannabis and 21 to engage in prostitution.
The most famous red light district in Amsterdam is called the De Wallen. Singelgebied and Ruysdaelkade are also areas where prostitution is allowed.
Although prostitution is allowed in certain areas in Amsterdam, street prostitution is not. So don’t try to pick up women in the street.
Don’t take pictures of the prostitutes in the Red Light District. Buy a souvenir or a postcard instead.
