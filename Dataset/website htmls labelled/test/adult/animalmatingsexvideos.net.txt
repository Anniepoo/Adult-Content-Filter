Will zoo gorillas laugh if you make faces at them? Can a dog develop Alzheimer’s? Are some cats as anxious as their owners? Will a parrot feel better on antidepressants? Can a goat cheer up a horse? In New York Times Bestseller ANIMAL MADNESS: Inside Their Minds, Laurel Braitman, a historian and anthropologist of science, answers these questions and many more as she takes the reader on an extraordinary journey  through the inner lives of animals and the surprising ways their emotional and mental health so often mirrors our own, turning up lessons that Publishers Weekly calls “Illuminating…Braitman’s delightful balance of humor and poignancy brings each case of life….[Animal Madness’s] continuous dose of hope should prove medicinal for humans and animals alike.” Braitman tells the compelling history of our efforts to make sense of animal minds, from Charles Darwin to today’s Harvard psychiatrists with gorilla patients. But it also tethers that history to accounts of her rescue dogs and their progress towards happiness, of contemporary elephants whose hearts are healed by new love, of cats and rats eased through their sadness with the help of human therapists, and of canine and human war veterans working to overcome PTSD together.
Every being with a mind has the capacity to lose hold of it from time to time. Luckily we can almost always find them again. While this book is far from a training manual, it will change the way you try to help, entertain, play with, watch, and nurture the creatures you care about. It may even help you understand the most complicated one of all: yourself.

The New York Times calls Animal Madness a “lovely, big–hearted book…brimming with compassion and the tales of the many, many humans who devote their days to making animals well.” Read more.
Publisher’s Weekly says it’s “Illuminating….Braitman’s delightful balance of humor and poignancy brings each case to life….[Animal Madness’s] continuous dose of hope should prove medicinal for humans and animals alike.” More.
“This is a marvelous, smart, eloquent book — as much about human emotion as it is about animals and their inner lives.  Braitman’s research is fascinating, and she writes with the ease and engagement of a natural storyteller.” Susan Orlean, author of Rin Tin Tin and The Orchid Thief
“Where the BuzzFeed Animals page, for example, urges us to see animals as an undifferentiated mass of squee-worthy fluff,” Joshua Rothman writes in The New Yorker, “Braitman wants us to take animals seriously—to see them as individuals with life histories and psychologies as dramatic and intense as our own.” More.
“A gem..that can teach much us much about the wildness of our own minds,” according to Psychology Today. More.
