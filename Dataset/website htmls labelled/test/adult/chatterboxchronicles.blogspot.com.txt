A Review of Raven and My Study of Jonestown
-The Jonestown massacre on November 18,1978 has always been a topic of interest to me.  I have watched documentaries and read books on it over the years.
-After I read Leslie Wagner-Wilson's book, Slavery of Faith, I knew I needed to read a comprehensive book about Jonestown.
-Tim Reiterman's book is described as, "the seminal book on the story of Jonestown."  To say it is the seminal book is an understatement.  Everything you'd ever want to know about Jim Jones, The People's Temple and Jonestown are in the 600 plus pages.
-Tim Reiterman was a journalist who wrote about Jim Jones and The People's Temple.  He wanted to visit Jonestown to write about it, but didn't get a chance until Congressman Leo Ryan's trip in November of 1978.
-When leaving Jonestown, Congressman Ryan and 3 others were shot and killed on the airstrip by Larry Layton and other Jones loyalists.  Reiterman was one of many who were shot, but only injured.  They had to wait till the next morning for rescue.
-Reiterman not only reported on Jonestown, but he became a part of its demise.
In his eloquent and almost biblical prose, Jones disguised his agnosticism--or atheism--and hid the fact that he was using religion for social goals.--pg. 50
While he pursued the conventional goals of an aggressive fundamentalist preacher--money and members--he also moved in new directions: toward cultlike control of his people and toward communism under the guise of Christian Communalism.--pg. 57
Step by step Jones was leading his people to the conclusion that he was a prophet.  The people trusted him and stood in awe of him; they compromised themselves by accepting his destruction of the Bible.--pg. 93 of Raven
-Jones has sometimes been described as an "evangelical preacher".  When I researched Jones, that doesn't describe him at all.  He didn't even really believe in God or Jesus, he thought he was god.  He believed in socialism and in getting people to worship him.  While still in the U.S., he supported both Democrats and Republicans so he could have power.  But he definitely allied himself with liberals who believed in socialism.
-Jones did fake healings, and all kinds of bizarre things even before he left the U.S. for Guyana.  His closest advisors and confidants knew that he was a fraud, but thought the ends justified the means when it came to their socialistic goals.
-Amazingly, once Jones had people following him, they put up with inconceivable things.  He was not only a serial adulterer, but bragged from the pulpit that he was sleeping with many different women and men.  Many of these people didn't want to voluntarily sleep with him, but felt that they had no choice because of who he was.
-He manipulated people, and got away with it, until some people started to defect.  When that happened and the media got wind of it, he moved over 1,000 of his people to the socialist country of Guyana in South America.
-When people arrived, their passports were immediately confiscated and many of them realized quickly that they had made a huge mistake in giving up their freedom.  Jones required everyone to work long hours, there wasn't much food, and they were often denied sleep.  Jonestown was an armed encampment where people weren't free to leave.
-By the time the "concerned relatives" (of some Jonestown inhabitants), Congressman Ryan and the journalists came to Jonestown, Jones had already conditioned and rehearsed mass suicide events with his people.  So when people started leaving Jonestown, and Jones realized he was losing control, he initiated the mass suicide.
-If people didn't comply, they were forced to drink the cyanide.  In the recording of the event you can hear children screaming and crying and Jones urging everyone to die with dignity.
-It is incomprehensible how brainwashed the people had to have been to comply.  Ironically, a sign at Jonestown read, "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it."  Jones dead body was found right underneath it.

A Review of And the Good News Is...
Over the years that I worked for him he became much more to me than my boss or even the President of the United States.  He became like a second father, a friend, and a confidant.--Dana Perino
-I ended up loving this book and Dana Perino much more than I expected too.  She followed Tony Snow as the White House Press Secretary and those were big shoes to fill.
What I loved about her and the book:
-Her optimism-she has this in common with her former boss, George W. Bush.  Optimism endears me to people and was one of the things I loved about W.
-Her love and loyalty for George W. Bush
-Her patriotism
-Her unashamed defense of being a conservative
-She too was upset by Scott McClellan's book unfairly attacking the Bush Administration
-She reaffirmed my respect for Bush as a man and a president
-She reaffirmed my love and respect for Tony Snow
-I appreciated the advice she gave, and it was helpful to me
-She was able to say nice things about Obama and Biden as men, even though she disagrees with them.
-I enjoyed hearing about how she met and fell in love with her husband.
-What was incredible to me as I read the book, was how emotional I still get about the loss of Tony Snow.
-I can't recommend this book highly enough.  If you want to be inspired by a strong woman, Dana is your gal.  She represents conservative women well.  I'll be watching The Five much more often.

Fox Business/Wall Street Journal GOP Debate (11-10-15)!
Marco Rubio: "We can’t even have an economy if we’re not safe. There are radical jihadists in the Middle East beheading...
Posted by Fox News on Tuesday, November 10, 2015
Rubio had his usual stellar night, it's simply amazing! There's no
subject on which he's not fluent, forceful and passionate.~Charles
Krauthammer
According to many, Marco Rubio is now 4-0 at the GOP Debates.  Below is a great summary of the debate and assessment of the candidates:
My take on the Republican presidential debate that just ended: I thought
Marco Rubio won again. He's got tremendous raw political skills, and he
gave a preview of the argument he'd
like to make against Hillary Clinton in the fall--that this is a time
for generational change.
Ben Carson showed more energy but no mastery of
issues.
Jeb Bush did better than in previous debates but not well
enough to stop the momentum for Rubio among donors.
Kasich may have hurt
himself with his interruptions and unpopular answers.
Trump was more
mellow than before, but he strikes me as the least wattage
intellectually on stage.
Carly Fiorina had a good night and had some
nice lines.
And Ted Cruz may have the highest IQ but the lowest EQ.~Nicholas Kristof
Marco Rubio just crushed Rand Paul.  20 of our #GOPDebate group picked Rubio, 7 picked Rand
"America must be strongest" hit 90 on the dials
— Frank Luntz (@FrankLuntz) November 11, 2015
Things I was happy about:
-Mike Huckabee didn't make the cut to be a part of the main debate.
-Rubio did a great job as always.  He is knowledgeable on all the issues and does an amazing job of presenting them and in responding quickly to other candidates.
-Rubio crushing Rand Paul.
-Trump getting booed twice!
-Carly Fiorina holding her own.
-The moderators not being idiots.
Things that annoyed me:
-Trump insulting Kasich.
-Rand Paul attacking Rubio.
-Bush and Kasich bumbling and trying to interrupt.  It just looked kind of pathetic.
-Ted Cruz annoys the hell out of me every time he talks.  He just comes across as smarmy, and like a slick used car salesman.
More praise for Rubio:
Rubio knocked it out of the park when debating military spending and the
right role for America in the world with Rand Paul. He got a meatball
of a question when asked  by the moderators about Hillary Clinton's
résumé as compared with his own; he, unsurprisingly, answered it well
and easily. Time and time again, he oozed knowledge while appearing
entirely relaxed.~The Washington Post
If you rank everybody, Rubio, of course -- look he has done well, and he’s been at the top of the top. ~Karl Rove
I thought Marco Rubio did
very well. I thought he did exceptionally well. ... He’s not only
knowledgeable, which is important, he’s good at politics because part of
running for President is showbiz. I mean that in the best sense, and
he’s good at that as well as being knowledgeable.~Bernie Goldberg
Winners:
Rubio and Cruz leaning a bit toward Rubio.
2. Carly had a good night.
I think everyone else was kind of just a mix.
All did fairly well but had something that set them back.~Glenn Beck

First Lady Profile #9~Abigail Adams
Abigail
was the support and 'dearest friend' who helped John reach the greatest
heights. She will be remembered for this and also for her own
strengths. Self-reliant, she raised her family and managed the farm for
the many years that John was away during and after the war. Brave and
caring, she inspired her family and friends to stand up for their
beliefs, and found time to comfort them in time of need. Spirited and witty, she brought cheer to all around her.--Kem Knapp Sawyer
-Fortunately, there is a wealth of knowledge about Abigail Adams.  She and John wrote many letters during their frequent absences from each other.  These letters were saved (unlike the letters between George and Martha Washington, which were destroyed), thus giving us a wonderful picture of history:
Abigail started writing at a young age, and she never stopped.  She used her pen to reflect on-and influence-the course of history.--Kem Knapp Sawyer
FACTS:
-Abigail was born in November of 1744 in Weymouth, Massachusetts.  Her father was a minister and a farmer.
-She wanted to go to school but was sick a lot as a child and girls didn't have the same schooling opportunities as boys.  Her mom taught her the basics and she educated herself by reading many of the books from her father's library.
-She married John Adams on October 25th, 1764.  She was 19 and John was 28.
-Abigail had 6 children: Abigail (Nabby), John Quincy, Susanna (who only lived 13 months), Charles, Thomas and a baby that was born stillborn.
If particular care and attention is not paid to the ladies, we are determined to foment a rebellion, and will not hold ourselves bound by any laws in which we have no voice or representation.~Abigail Adams
-She was a strong woman who took care of her children and managed the farm during John's many absences in service to their country.
-Abigail actually watched the Battle of Bunker Hill from their farm and wrote about it to her husband.
-She was her husband's confidant and principal adviser as he helped shape the country by being a part of the Constitutional Conventions, being a foreign minister, the vice president and finally the 2nd President of the United States.
-She was a fierce advocate for the rights of women and African Americans.  Both she and John were against slavery and never owned slaves.
-She died on October 28, 1818 and sadly never got to see her oldest son become the 6th President of the United States.

KC Royals #TakeTheCrown and win the World Series Against the Mets!
The Royals took the crown and beat the Mets 7-2 on Sunday to win their first World Series
since Ronald Reagan was President. Not having had a championship season
since 1985, the KC team were in last year’s World Series but came up
short against the San Francisco Giants.~Dominic Patten
-I'm not a big baseball fan, but when your whole city gets excited about something, it is hard not to get excited too.
-I bought my Royals' shirts to wear at work, and started watching the games.
-So many of the postseason games were exciting as I watched them be down by runs and then come back to win in the end.
-It was electrifying tonight to see the game go into extra innings, and then for them to pull it off and become World Series champs.
-Congrats KC Royals!!! Congrats Salvador on winning MVP!!
-And the above photo makes the win even sweeter!!

A Review of 41: A Portrait of my Father
1st--I
ended up liking this book a lot more than I thought I would. I wasn't
paying attention to current events when George Bush Sr. was president.
As a result, my view of him was tainted by the few facts that I heard
about him from various sources.2nd--I was impressed with Bush Sr. once I saw him as a whole man--the way he lived his life, his
character, the jobs he took and his principles. The Bush family was
admirable as well.3rd--I loved getting the unique perspective of
a presidential son of his presidential father. It was neat to have him
compare different events in both of their presidencies, and how they
affected him and his father. As George W. Bush brings up, historian David McCullough said he would've loved to have read a book written by
John Quincy Adams about his father, John Adams.4th--I love George W. Bush and think he was an amazing president. I enjoyed hearing him read this audio book himself.

Paul Ryan Becomes the 54th Speaker of the House!
So
after all the meshugas on the right over the past few years, the
Republicans could wind up with two new leaders going into this election,
Marco Rubio and Paul Ryan. That’s a pretty excellent outcome for a
party that has shown an amazing tendency to inflict self-harm.
Ryan
is the new House speaker and right now Rubio is the most likely
presidential nominee. The shape of the presidential campaign is coming
into focus. It’s still wise to expect (pray) that the celebrity
candidates will fade as the shopping phase ends and the buying phase
begins.~David Brooks
-I've been a huge Paul Ryan fan for a long time.  I used to live in Wisconsin, and was so impressed to see such a strong conservative get elected there.
-I was excited when Romney put him on the ticket in 2012.  If only the VP picks could've saved the actual candidates in both 2008 and 2012.
-So, when it looked like Ryan was going to get the speaker job, I was happy.  It sounds like a grueling job to have, but I think Ryan could actually make a positive difference.
My friends, you have done me a great honor. The people of
this country, they have done all of us a great honor. Now let’s prove
ourselves worthy of it.~Paul Ryan
-The above video gives a small glimpse of his character.
Ryan's plans:
Before Ryan embarks on some of his legislative goals — tax and welfare
reform, for example — he'll face the task of following through on his
promises to the rank and file. To prove he’s serious about reforming the
institution, Ryan is embarking on an overhaul of internal House
procedures, restructuring a powerful committee that selects committee
assignments. Ryan has told his colleagues that he plans to rewrite
internal institutional rules by the end of the year, with the help of
the entire House Republican Conference.
-I look forward to the future with Ryan as speaker of the House and hopefully, with Rubio as the Republican nominee for president.

October 28th GOP CNBC Debate!
All the Republicans came out to play hard tonight but Senator Marco Rubio
and Governor John Kasich clearly won—but for two different reasons.
Rubio weathered very tough attacks with facts, passion and style.~John Zogby
Marco Ru­bio knocked just about every ques­tion he faced at the third
Re­pub­lic­an pres­id­en­tial de­bate out of the park, wheth­er it was
from the CN­BC mod­er­at­ors or from one of his rivals. The Flor­ida
sen­at­or re­gistered a clean coun­ter­punch against Jeb Bush, one of
his top com­pet­it­ors, and he lam­basted one of con­ser­vat­ives’
fa­vor­ite punch­ing bags, the main­stream me­dia.
All the while, Ru­bio
suc­cess­fully de­flec­ted some of the most com­mon cri­ti­cisms he’s
en­countered on the cam­paign trail: namely, his sparse con­gres­sion­al
at­tend­ance re­cord and the hand­ling of his per­son­al fin­ances. And
the audi­ence took no­tice, of­ten re­spond­ing with re­sound­ing
ap­plause or even laughter.~Adam Wollner
-I had a lot of competing TV choices tonight.  The World Series with my Kansas City Royals was on, my kids and I always watch Survivor, and then for this political junkie, I had to watch the GOP Debate.
-To be honest, the main reason I was excited to watch, was to see my guy Rubio do well, and he never disappoints.
-CNBC showed their true colors in how they ran the debate, the moderators were condescending, extremely biased and didn't control the debate well at all.  They tried to pit the Republicans against one another, but it backfired.  It seemed to unite the Republicans and enabled Rubio and others to shine in light of it.
Rubio won tonight with wit, good humor, great one liners and substance.
— Ari Fleischer (@AriFleischer) October 29, 2015
Rubio had some amazing moments tonight, and there are quite a few video
clips that show just how well he knocked it out of the park.
1) The truth about candidates missing votes while running for president!  The above clip shows exactly what Zogby was talking about, Rubio responded to the moderator and to Jeb with "facts, passion and style".
-Jeb blew it when he tried to pile on, Rubio mopped the floor with him, and this might be the final nail in Jeb's coffin.
2) The truth about Rubio's tax plan!  John Harwood proved he was an idiot by using incorrect information about Rubio's tax plan, that he HIMSELF had to correct 2 weeks ago, wow!!  Below is the correction:
CORRECTING earlier tweet: Tax Foundation says Rubio benefits lowest 10% proportionally more (55.9) than top 1% (27.9%). Avg for all: 17.8%.
— John Harwood (@JohnJHarwood) October 14, 2015
The best quotes of the night from Rubio:
The democrats have the ultimate Super PAC- it's called the main stream media.
The more you tax something, the less of it you get.
We have 11 good candidates on this stage, the Democrats can't even come up with ONE.
I'm against anything bad for my mother.
The best quotes from others:
The questions asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American
people don’t trust the media. This is not a cage match.~Ted Cruz
Do you want me to answer or do you want to answer? Because I got to tell
you the truth, even in New Jersey what you’re doing is called rude.~Chris Christie
Folks, we’ve got to wake up. We cannot elect somebody that doesn’t know how to do the job.~John Kasich
I may not be your dream candidate, just yet, but I can assure you: I am Hillary Clinton’s worse nightmare.~Carly Fiorina
Some great articles about the debate:
-The 15 most explosive moments of the GOP debate
-Marco Rubio made a big splash at the third GOP debate
-Is Marco Rubio's Breakout Debate Win Enough to Oust the Outsider Candidates?
-Who Won the Third Republican Presidential Debate?
In Conclusion, Bill Kristol sums up the debate and the World Series game in one short tweet:
Best performances of night: Rubio, Cruz, Christie, Cueto.
Worst: Jeb! ; Mets hitters.

First Lady Profile #8--Martha Washington!
Painstaking research reveals a delightful, intelligent, and passionate woman who shared a life of mutual love and support with the country's foremost founding father.--Patricia Brady
-I am a big history buff when it comes to the presidents and first ladies.  I embarked on this first ladies series awhile ago, and since then I've discovered C-Span's series on the First Ladies.  This has given me a renewed desire to dig even deeper and read numerous books on each first lady.
-I am watching the C-Span profile on each first lady, and then reading books on each of them.  I also bought the book on the first ladies which is a companion piece for the C-Span series.
-I have always known a lot about George Washington and very little about Martha.  I have been impressed by what I have learned about her and it has greatly increased my respect for her.
-As I read about her, I was struck by how much she loved both of her husbands, and her children, and not just her biological children, but the many children she took on as her own throughout her life.
-She also was very smart and was considered a "great catch" when George married her.  She was the perfect woman to be the first "first lady".
FACTS:
-She was born on June 2, 1731 on a plantation near Williamsburg, Virginia.  She was the oldest of 9 children and went by Patsy.
-She was 18 when she married Daniel Parke Custis on May 15, 1750.  She had 4 children with him: Daniel, Frances, John, and Martha.
-Daniel and Frances died in childhood, and her husband Daniel died in 1757.  Martha was a rich widow at age 25 with 2 children.
From the time Martha first gave birth at eighteen or nineteen, she was a really wonderful mother.  She doted on her children, her grandchildren, her nieces and nephews.  During the war with the young officers, young aides-de-camp, she was more or less like a housemother at a fraternity; she looked after these young men...Forever afterword, the young men of those days remembered her as their foster mother.--Patricia Brady
-She married George Washington when they were both 27, and George helped raise her children.
-Her daughter Martha (who also was known as Patsy), had epilepsy and died during a seizure while she was a teenager.
-Her son John (known as Jacky) married and had 4 children.  He died during the Revolutionary War from typhus.  George and Martha raised 2 of his children after his death, Eleanor and George.
George Washington was the indispensable man to the success of the American Revolution, and Martha Washington was the indispensable woman to him. He could bear all those years away from home, creating a national army, because she spent part of every year with him, no matter how awful the conditions in camp might be.
Their mutual love, confidence, and support helped keep him going in the face of every disappointment, setback, and defeat.  Every year she made a home for him, where he could rest and refresh his spirits until it was time to go back in the field another time, for however long it took to win the war.  Out of those eight and a half years he spent in command of thMe army, she was with him for nearly five, more than half the war, in stays ranging from three to ten months.  Martha was truly the secret weapon of the American Revolution.--Patricia Brady
-During the Revolutionary War, George and Martha could not bear to be apart, so Martha always traveled to be with him for several months out of the year.
-During George's two terms as president, Martha was a great example of what a first lady should be like.  Abigail Adams was in awe of her.
She talked about how the experience of her life had taught her that 'our happiness or misery depends upon our disposition and not our circumstances.'  That is a remarkably wise observation, but it's an observation distilled from a life full of tragedy.  She'd lost a husband, she lost all four of her children, she lost countless nieces and nephews, and then she found herself repeatedly uprooted from the life she expected, to follow George either on the battlefield, or on a different kind of battlefield.--Richard Norton Smith
-She died on May 22, 1802 at the age of 70.
