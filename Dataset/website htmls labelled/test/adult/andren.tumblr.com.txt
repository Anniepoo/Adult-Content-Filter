The Ballad of Loving Turtle and Lady Loving TurtleRunnin Bare #298/528After doing some scanning, I realized that there were 2 versions of Runnin Bare cards #298/#528. The first card features the names of both Loving Turtle and Lady Loving Turtle.The second card sees the Loving Turtle with a new handle: The Sexy Single. The third card has both names but must have been sent out shortly after the (seemly acrimonious) demise of the couple. The fourth card is a modified version of the  card, with the eyeball and Leo is single.
