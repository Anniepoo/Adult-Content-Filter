Diary of a Porn Star!
Diary of a porn star
The blog for Angel. British glamour model and pornstar!
This blog is all about what I get up to, if you want to see some of the thing I do then look at Mobile Body, a web and wap based site.

So as I was telling you, my friend Angel asked me to take some photos of her - she told me that she wanted to do some nude photos. But when I started taking the shots I didn't know how far she'd go. Then she got out her pink dildo and started using it. It's funny how some girls just let go when they're in front of the camera. Mind you a couple of glasses of wine helped. After I put the photos on >Voyeurweb I got a good response ... but more surprising was that some other UK amateurs emailed me their photos. One of the amatuers was Morgan who asked me if I'd take some pictures of her - we agreed in advance what we were going to do and I shot some school uniform and bondage sets. In the meantime Angel got back to me and said she fancied doing something out doors. We went to a local woods - it was February so she brought a big fur coat - and found a quiet spot. Except it wasn't that quiet ... every so often we could hear some russling. I thought it was an animal but after about 10 minutes a park warden jumped out of the bushes. I don't think he was too upset about what we were doing, mind you, but he said we had to move on. He thought we were a couple out for a bit of a thrill ... which I suppose we were, in a way. After I put a post in the Voyeurweb forum, Paige got in touch and said she wanted some pictures. Paige was interesting because she was a really nice girl, but quite shy. Kind of odd that she wanted to do it - but shy or not, I think some people find the idea of seeing sexy photos quite a turn on. Paige has probably got the best response of the stuff that I put on >Voyeurweb. A little while later Morgan dropped me a line again to ask me if I'd be interesed in taking some more photos. She mentioned that she'd like to do some cock sucking video. I assumed that she meant with her boyfriend. I'd met him last time and he was a friendly bloke, so I had no problem with it. When I arrived at her house, her boyfriend was there, but both Morgan and her boyfriend had decided that she was going to suck my cock! I was surprised and nervous to say the least. I tried to convince her boyfriend to do it, but
he said that he'd prefer to shoot the video. In the end we agreed that it was better that Morgan and I were alone, so I se the video up on a tripod and off we went. Her boyfriend had gone to work by then! Having your dick sucked on camera is a weird experience. Morgan was great, but I spend most of the time looking at the screen checking that we were still in the shot. The biggest turn-on was when I got home and saw what I'd shot. Not long after that Morgan told a friend of hers to get in touch with me. Tilly's just 19 and wanted me to photograph her with another girl - an Asian friend of her's called Luxi. After my experience with Morgan I thought I'd ask them if they wanted to do a three-some. I was pretty amazed when they liked the idea! Both Tilly and Luxi were fantastic - I could see that they were really into each other. As with Morgan I was pretty nervous about shooting them giving me a blow job - nervous enough that I wasn't sure if I could get an erection! That might sound weird - I mean how many guys are get turned on by the idea of two gorgeous babes sucking your dick - but I think it was a case of performance anxiety. As much as anything else there are practical issues of how to get the right angle to film two girls sucking your cock. Anyway they were both really sweet and I managed to get wood in the end. It's a bit of an odd world 'cos from time to time these nice-looking amateurs just email me sexy pictures of themselves out of the blue. That happened one day with Kelly. She sent me 3 photos of herself in a bikini. She'd only just turned 18 and I could see that she was a great looking girl, but the photos were terrible! I emailed her to thank her (always pays to be polite!) and suggested that we do a session. She was really into the idea but made it clear that she'd only go topless. She also said that she wanted some proper glamour shots, so I suggested she came to my place where I could set up a mini-studio. When she turned up for the shoot she kept telling me how nervous she was, and that she'd never done anything like this before. I spent the first 30 minutes just getting her to relax. I got her to pose just in her t-shirt and jeans and tried different poses - standing, sitting and lying. Once she'd seen the digital photos she started to relax a bit and I she changed into some nice lingere. She was happy to take her bra off and pose topless and pose in a see through thong. I pointed out that she might as well take her knickers off as she was pretty much nude anyway! Kelly had relaxed enough by then, but as she was taking off her underwear she said 'I don't even let my boyfriend see me nude!'. I've not added the photos of gorgeous Kelly yet, but I'll put them on VW shortly. Coming soon ... Strawberry - the most enthusiastic cock sucker I've photographed (her pictures are in the member's area>!

I really don't have time to update this blog anymore, so I've asked my photographer friend, Dave to do some updates. OK, yes I know it seems different now I've handed this over to a bloke, but trust me, his stuff will be well worth reading. He's been taking adult and glamour pictures for a few years now and has some great stories about us models. He's also been in a couple of films - can't wait to hear the stories of a slightly reluctant porn-star!

Thought I'd given up? Well I had, but then I decided it was time to post a few more tales.
So what have I been up to for the last few months. Well I'd given up on modelling for a while.
The trouble is that there are just too many unreliable wankers out there - people booking me for shoots then cancelling at the last minute or worse, not turning up at all!!!
But then, I realise that I had to make a living somehow, and when push comes to shove, porn is probably the easiest way to make a quick penny.
The first thing was that I wanted to make money from my photos - I've got loads of stuff that I did with a friend just waiting for the world to see it. Sadly, thanks to the credit card processors, the web porn business is all but dead. However, the big new thing (and something that I've been working on for a while) is the mobile phone porn.
The latest thing that I've done is a site called Mobile Body ... that's a photo of me on the front there.
The whole thing is based around a new concept for phones, which is a daily update by charging each day by SMS (text message). It's focussed on me and a few other UK porn babes.
Some of the photo's/videos come from my photographer friend - he hired a couple of friends of mine to do a threesome. Kind of interesting I suppose! Of course these things are always unusual to do. He travelled to deepest darkest Wales (that's another country next to England in case you weren't sure) and met up with two models - Luxi and Tilly. I've worked with both of them and they're pretty cool babes.
Now, most guys would get excited by the idea of a threesome ... in fact my friend said that he thought it was going to be great. But life on camera isn't quite like that. Maybe it was the heat of the lights, maybe it was nurves, but he was having real trouble getting his dick hard!
Finally after some coaxing (well, some great cock sucking by my friends) he managed to get wood long enough to get the shoot done.
Actually the results are pretty good ... although I'm only posting them on my mobile site for now, but here are a few samples and a bit of video.

Here I am, back again!!!
You probably thought I'd dissapeared, but I haven't.
That's the trouble with the porn business, we're still so fucking unreliable! (hee hee)
There's not too much news on the modelling front. I did a shoot for Razzle, which if you don't know it, is kind of like the UK's answer to Hussler. They're pretty good to work for as it's regular stuff. Each issue has about 15 or so girls - it's all 'continental' work, showing your pussy, basically.
Now the thing that amazes me about that magazine is that even though they're supposed to be the top publication in Britain for that kind of thing, the quality of the pictures are crap.
The latest shoot I did is really dissapointing. It just doesn't look like me. But that's the trouble with doing that kind of shoot - you don't get any say in which photos are used.
In the meantime, I've been getting my mobile phone sites off the ground. That's been much more interesting.
What I've done is put together various galleries of me and some other models which can be accessed by WAP phone. UK users can access it by sending a 'text trigger' number (mine's go 20304050 to phone number 89080) and paying £1.50 for access.
I'm surprised at how much easier it is to get people to pay their £1.50 than it is to sell a website subscription. Maybe because it's cheap or maybe because people don't mind paying for stuff on their phone (but object to paying for it on the internet). I'm not sure at this stage.
The big downside of this is that you have to get a lot more £1.50's to make money than a web site. The other thing is that you can't have recurring billing - which as any adult webmaster will tell you, is the real money spinner in porn sites.
So at this stage I'm putting all my efforts in the phone sites - if you want to see what I'm doing with them, I've put a page together.
Most of the business is coming from banner ads - that's also weird, cos for adult web sites the hit rate is tiny. I've been imitating the style of the new 3g ads that they have here in the UK. This is an example of one:
Until next time!!!

More about the photographer
I was saying a couple of posts back about my friend the photographer. He was off do a shoot with a model who would only do boy/girl hardcore stuff either with her boyfriend or the photographer.
So off he goes to the shoot, thinking that he'd be taking pictures and doing videos of this model with her boyfriend. Except that when he arrives there the model's boyfriend says that he really doesn't want to be in the shoot. He claimed he was too busy. The girlfriend suggests that John (the photographer) does instead (it was supposed to be a b/g shoot all along). He wasn't too keen either. Apparently she's a really nice looking girl - just 18 actually - but he didn't think he could rise to the occasion.
The point is that these things seem easy enough to do if you're a girl, but if you're a guy, getting a good erection (getting wood, as they say in the porn business) is actually quite difficult. I suppose the thing is that on a porn shoot it's not like 'real sex' - yes, people are shagging each other, sucking dick's for real. However you've got to get the angles right - there's no point in hiding under the bed-clothes ya know. There's so much to worry about it, sex is probably the last thing on your mind! Sorry if I'm shattering any illusions here, but porn is just acting.
Anyway, back to John the photographer. There was a long discussion between the model, her boyfriend and John about which of them was going to get their dick sucked on camera. In the end the boyfriend said that he was off out, and left the model and John to get on with it.
John said the model was really nice about it all and they worked out exactly what they were going to do and she promised there'd be no teeth. He said it went well, in that he managed to keep an erection for long enough (as long as he thought about the right things). Although he reckoned that the chances of getting a cum shot out of it were none at all!
Anyway, John was kind enough to let me use some of the stills from the shoot on my site. So here's a link to them ... the last two are off the video apparently. Of course I'll be thinking of John quite differently now (hee hee).

More on CC processors
I have to rant on about this some more, because it's just doing me in! After one of my credit card processors pulled the plug on me last week, it really left me in the shit!
The trouble with loosing a processor is that it takes forever to get a new one. In the meantime, all the traffic visiting the site is going to waste. I think people make a pretty instant reaction to porn. They see it, they like it, they want it. I just don't think that someone's going to wait around and come back later.
The biggest problem though is that you loose the recurring billings - when people join adult sites, there's usually a recurring subscription. For everyone that joins, about 30% don't leave. So not only do I loose my main earnings, but the rebills go as well.
So what's the answer? Well I think that it's gotta be mobile porn. Now that there are so many phones around with colour screens and video, people will be quite happy to do that.
The other advantage is that the visitor doesn't have to mess about with credit cards and the webmaster doesn't have to deal with the processors.
So now I've set up a WAP site ... this is it (sorry for the shameless plug)
The problem I'm then left with is how to promote it. I don't think the usual search engine thing will work for these sites. I reckon the only way is good ole' fashioned adverts in the newspapers.
The other difficulty is that it's only for UK based users. Apparently the rest of Europe will come on line soon ... but god knows when US phone users can access their porn!

So everyone's asking .... what's the next big thing?
Well it's gotta be porn on mobile phones. Why do I say that? Well I'm rapidly coming to the conclusion that porn on the internet is dead.
A bold statement you might say, given that the web seems full of sites from nude girls, to hardcore sex and not to mention all the weird sex.
And its true that everyone and their dog are getting broadband and adsl connections mostly so that they can surf for their porno faster.
No what I mean by dead, is that for individual models and small time webmaster (that's meeee!) it's just too difficult.
The biggest problem is the credit card processors - they're getting hammered by Visa who are making all kinds of rules up. OK, theres the stuff about model's ages, which is fair enough. But now we're getting all kinds of other nonesense. Must have a note of the ages on every page, can't have nude celebs, can't have topless beaches.
Sometimes Visa just pulls the plug on a CCprocessor for no reason at all. That happened to one of mine last week.

Adult Models are funny people.
A photographer friend of mine, John, was contacted by a model who he'd done work for before. She'd wanted to get some more sets for a site she was building. The deal was that he'd do some photos and video, both would work for free, but in return they could both use the content.
That's a fairly standard deal in this business.
When he'd worked with this model before she was only working with other girls, not guys. Now she says that she do boy/girl photos (sucking and fucking, I suppose) - kind of useful, 'cos if you're building a website like that you need the material.
So John asks her if she can get any guys to work for free (not too difficult really). The model replies that she doesn't get on with male adult models and would prefer not to work with them. She prefers to work with the photographer. Or to put it bluntly, she'd rather fuck the photographer on camera than a model. (She also said that she hoped John wouldn't be offended by the remark!)
I think it's very funny that the model can be so forward like that, especially about asking to shag the photographer. It's even funnier 'cos John is so obviously gay! He said to her that much as he'd like to help out, he really wasn't sure if he could rise to the occasion.

Site Lates
The latest news on the site is that I'm closing it! Well kind of. I'll keep it going but it's time to get some friends involved.
The site has never really taken off, but the latest thing has been a load of grief from the CC processor.
There has been an on going problem with European based people taking credit cards with American processors. They don't trust us. Plus America seems to be getting a moral backlash. They don't like porn and the credit card companies don't want to be associated with it. Publicly at least.
The thing is that porn is what makes the internet go round. It's also what keeps a lot of these CC processing companies in business, so the Credit Card boys are going to loose a shed load of money if they stamp out porn. they've probably realised this, so what they've done instead is to introduce a load of restrictions to make it hard for Adult sites. The requirements go well beyond the law and they're expecting the sites to pay $750 a year for the privalage.
Anyway, that's enough of that. I recently set up a site with me and friends - its more hardcore than my other one, with lots of cocksucking and cum shots. The business is not bad, but as always I could do with more!
That's it for now
