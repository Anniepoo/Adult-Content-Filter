Ashley Rough Smut
Ashley/(Y/N) rough sex, language warning, possible trigger
“Ashley, fuck,” you whimpered as he pounded you mercilessly from behind. You and Ashley had been on and off and you were off now, and in the middle of the most intense break-up sex you’d ever had.
“Louder,” he taunted you, and you screamed. “Fucking whore,” he smacked your ass, and you cried out at the pleasure enhancing pain. His fingers were digging deep into your hips as his cock dug even deeper inside of you, bringing you closer and closer to orgasm as each of his angry strokes hit the spot deep inside you that made your toes curl and your mouth water.
“Fuck, (Y/N), damn whore,” he growled at you. “Tell me I’m better than Andy,” he demanded, grabbing your hair and pulling you up against his chest. “Say it,” he growled, assaulting your necks with his lips, leaving dark love bites.
“Fuck, yes Ash, so much better, FUCK!” you screamed as he threw you back down onto the bed and thrusted into you yet again. “God, you fill me so much better,” you screamed as he smacked you again.
“And you better fucking remember it,” he growled. “Only i know how to treat your pussy.” He reaches around and squeezed your breast hard. “Andy’s a fucking wimp, he can’t fuck you like I can, can he?” He questioned and you moaned, shaking your head as he tormented your poor nipples.
“God, Ash, he could never fuck me this good,” you promised and he growled. He pulled out of you and you whimpered.
“You wanna cum?!” He asked and you nodded, biting your lip and pushing back towards him, archon your back and begging him to finish you.
“Get on your knees, whore,” he said as he started to jack himself off. “Finish it,” he demanded and you eagerly sucked his cock, pleading with his orgasm, coaxing his cum out with your skilled tongue, he was feral and grabbed your head, bobbing it up and down his diamond hard shaft, practically choking you as he forced you to take his cock. You didn’t mind though, you’d done it plenty of times before.
“Fuck, (Y/N),” he groaned and you knew he was getting ready to cum. He pulled you off of him with a soft pop and the next thing you knew his cum was spitting onto your face in streams.
“Fuck, yes,” he groaned as he came and you smiled, opening your mouth to catch as much I’m as you could.
“Fucking whore,” he groaned, “clean it all up,” he commanded you and you gladly collected his warm essence with your tongue and fingers.
“That’s a good whore,” he murmured, with a satirical smile. “Lay back,” he commanded you and you nodded, your back had barely touched the sweat covered sheets when his mouth made contact with your soaked snatch. You cried out as he flicked his tongue across your clit, making the muscles in your abdomen tighten. “Fuck, Ash!” You pleaded for mercy at his death grip on your thighs and the heavenly feeling of his tongue against your most sensitive spot.
“Andy probably didn’t even touch you here, did he?” He questioned and you shook your head.
“He did, but he did horribly, I had to fake an orgasm to get him to stop,” you told him and he chuckled, biting lightly on your clit, making your entire body tense with anticipation.
He chuckled and looked up at you. “(Y/N), baby, you won’t be faking this one,” he chuckled and then went back to your aching core.
“Ash, ash, ash!” You arched your back as your orgasm snuck up on you. “Oh fuck, ASHLEY!” You screamed as you flew over the edge and his face was coated in your juices. The shocks that ran threw you were earth shattering and your toes were digging into the bed as your hands gripped the sheets tightly, your body arching and contorting.
“Andy didn’t make you feel like this, did he?” He asked, and you shook your head, as he licked up the evidence of your orgasm.
“Andy was a mistake, literally a waste I ten minutes,” you told him with a chuckle.
“Ten minutes, really?” He smirked and you nodded.
“Maybe, I was pretty drunk. It may have been less than that,” you laughed, stroking his reddish, mussed hair.
“Wow,” he chuckled, “even drunk I last a little longer than ten ducking minutes, Jesus.”
“Andy was nothing compared to you, Ash. He could never compare,” you smiled.
“I know,” he said cockily and you rolled your eyes.
“If I didn’t like you so much I’d kick you out right now just for being annoying,” you told him and he chuckled.
“But you do like me and my rippling muscles,” he chuckled, flexing for you.
You rolled your eyes and stroked his hair again.
“Whatever you say,” you assured him with a sleepy smile.
“I’m not even doing

Andy Voyeurism Smut
NSFW Andy/(Y/N) masturbation kink
Andy smiled at you and kissed you gently as he pushed you back onto the bed. “Thank you,” he murmured, knowing that this wasn’t going to be easy for you. He’d confessed to you earlier in the week that it was a fantasy of his to watch you masturbate, and you’d agreed to indulge him. After all, he was such a devoted lover, and this wasn’t really a big deal. It wasn’t like you’d be doing anything he didn’t already do to you at some point.
“I hope it’s everything you hoped for,” you told him honestly, wanting to hold up to whatever fantasy he had.
“I’m sure it will be,” he chuckled, kissing your lip and then plopping down into the chair he’d set at the foot of the bed, where he’d have a perfect view of your pussy. “Take your time and do whatever you need to,” he assured you, and you nodded.
You closed your eyes and forced yourself to relax. You heard him light a cigarette and the familiar sound of the lighter and the cigarette catching flam seemed to calm you entirely. You kept your eyes closed and pictured Andy, remembering the ways he would touch you. You were in just one of his torn up band tees and a pair of panties, and his beautiful eyes were just watching you, you could feel it. The smell of smoke permeated the room, he rarely smoked inside. This was a special occasion.
You ran your hands over your stomach lifting your shirt, you pulled it over your breasts and took it off entirely with little difficulty. You spared a glance at Andy who was smiling around his cigarette. He took it out of his mouth, blowing smoke before clapping his hands encouragingly. You blushed and closed your eyes again, running your fingers over your nipples lightly. They were already hardening and you let out a little sigh as you ran your cold fingers in circles over them. You opened your eyes to see Andy watching you intently, light shining in his eyes.
You trailed your hands down to your stomach, then ran them teasingly over your sides, knowing you were teasing Andy just as much as you were teasing yourself.
You hooked your thumbs in you panties and pulled them down slowly, agonizingly, both putting off the inevitable and teasing him. You trailed a hand back up your legs to your wet sex.
“Andy,” you murmured as a finger spread your folds.
“I’m right here, (Y/N),” he said to you, and you nodded and started kneading your clit lightly. You heard him groan and a zipper undo. You slipped a finger over you slick entrance, teasing yourself by pressing inside slightly.
“Mmm,” you hummed, and you heard Andy groan again.
“Beautiful,” he whispered as you removed your finger from your entrance and went back to focusing on your clit, rubbing it in small little circles.
“Spread your legs a little wider, baby, please,” he murmured, and you did as he instructed, playing with your nipples as you flicked your clit. You arched your back as you started to press harder and rub faster on the little bud. You could hear Andy groaning in the background of your mind and you realized he was watching you, really watching you, and probably touching himself as well. You moaned and slipped a digit slowly into your slick entrance, moving your other hand back to your clit as you worked yourself closer to the edge. You opened your eyes and saw Andy had rid himself of his jeans and underwear and was gently stroking the cock you loved so much.
“Andy, baby,” you whispered to him before groaning, your breath coming in pants as you started to near an orgasm.
“Fuck, you’re so sexy, (Y/N),” he groaned and started to stroke himself a little faster.
“Come here,” you pleaded, and he nodded, getting up and taking the hint as you raised your hips. He let you move your own hands and then slipped his own finger inside you. He groaned at the tight wetness.
“I want you, baby girl,” he murmured, and you sighed, nodding.
“Have me, baby, I’m all yours,” you murmured, letting him kiss you as he started to pump his fingers in and out of you.
“God, you’re tight,” he groaned and you stroked his hair lovingly.
“Andy, I want you,” you told him, and he chuckled.
“Then you can have me,” he promised kissing you and slipping inside you.
“Hmm,” you sighed as he waited for you to adjust. “Andy, baby,” you moved your hips a little giving him a silent okay.
He groaned as he started to thrust into you. The sex was quick, both of you worked up too much to worry about being slow or sweet. You were both filled with an insatiable lust. He was hard and determined for the two of you to cum. He slammed into you fast and rough, the sound of skin against skin was erotic. You couldn’t hold in your moans and keens as he pounded you.
“Oh baby, ugh, yes,” you moaned, holding onto him, digging your fingers into his back.
“Fuck, babe, you feel so good,” he told you, kissing your neck and then biting down just hard enough to leave a mark. “Watching you play with yourself was a huge turn on. Were you thinking of me?” He questioned and you nodded as he started to knead your clit.
“Fuck, yes, baby, Andy, god yes!” You screamed as you orgasmed. He groaned and his eyes closed and he released inside of you.
“Fuck, babe,” he panted, kissing you gently, “that was amazing.”
“Yeah,” you said breathily, still breathing hard.
“Thank you, (Y/N) I know how difficult that must’ve been for you,” he murmured, kissing your forehead.
“Anything for you, babe,” you murmured, and kissed his lips softly.
“I love you,” he whispered, kissing you in return.
“I love you too,” you returned, settling against him to sleep.
“You’re everything I ever wanted,” he told you just before you fell asleep, making you smile.

Andy Birthday Smut
NSFW Andy/(Y/N)
“Andy!” you yelled happily, throwing yourself into your boyfriends arms.
“Hey, (Y/N), did you forget I was coming home today?” he asked with a chuckle at your eagerness.
“Nope, I’m just so glad your home!” you said with a giggle reaching up in your tiptoes to kiss his nose. “How was your time with your family?” you asked him with a cheery smile and he grinned back at you.
“It was great, I really wish you would’ve come with,” he said and you shook your head.
“I love you, but you hadn’t seen them in so long, I didn’t want to take any time away from your time with them,” you explained for what felt like the billionth time. You’d practically had to beg him to go see his parents on his own. It meant spending your first Christmas and his birthday apart, but it was for a good cause. You had a surprise for him.
“You didn’t take my call yesterday, or answer my texts,” he pouted and you giggled, kissing his pouting lips.
“I was working,” you explained, and he frowned.
“You work too much,” he told you and you smiled.
“Says the man who works more than I do.” You rolled your eyes at him then smiled at his little grin. “I know I missed your birthday, so I’m going to make it up to you,” you murmured seductively, biting your lip. “Go in the bedroom, I’ll be there in a second. A smile lit up his face and he kissed you before going to the bedroom like you asked. You grinned and went into the kitchen, quickly changing into the new lacy black lingerie that you were sure he love. You grabbed a the little tray you’d loaded with champagne and strawberries as well as a new pack of cigarettes and a prettily wrapped black box with a red bow on it, containing a custom engraved Batman lighter. You smiled at your handiwork and went to the bedroom. You giggled when you walked in to find him already stripped and waiting for you, lounging on the bed with that sexy self-assured smirk he always wore when he knew he was getting what he wanted.
"Hey there,” he said, as though he’d been expecting a friend to walk in. He seemed so casual about it but the less than innocent implications in his expression had you wondering if you were going to be able to go through with your plan.
“Hey, birthday boy,” you smiled, setting the tray down on the night stand. “I got you a couple of presents, which one do you want to unwrap first?” You asked, sitting beside him on the bed and kissing him.
“This one,” he said, taking your waist in his hands and pulling you towards him, kissing you deeply. You moaned a little in surprise, but returned the kiss in kind, running your hands through his hair.
“This one wasn’t an option, but since I missed your birthday I guess I can allow it this one time, but next time pick something on he list, and maybe wait until options have been given to you,” you told him, and he chuckled, kissing your neck.
“You talk to much,” he murmured against your skin, taking a handful of lace and tugging it, trying to get it off of you. You giggled and just ran a hand through his hair idly.
“Don’t make me admit I need help, because I won’t, I’ll rip the fucking thing,” he warned you, getting fed up with his inability to undress you. You laughed and pulled away from him, standing up.
You slipped off your stockings and garter belts first, not looking at him, which you knew drove him crazy. You let them drop to the floor and then turned your back to him to undo the lacing on your front, letting the little baby doll slip enticingly down your shoulders, leaving you in your bra and pantries.
“Think you can handle it from here?” you asked him and he nodded eyes trained on your breasts intently. You giggled and straddled him.
“Well then?” you asked when he didn’t move, and he smirked.
“Well then,” he repeated, reaching around to I clasp your bra.
“Is that a microphone or are you just happy to see me?” you asked, rubbing yourself against his already semi-erect cock.
“Oh believe me, I’m very happy to see you,” he smirked, pushing your hips down on him a little harder, groaning at the friction you made. “I’m not the only one though, those lace panties aren’t hiding anything,” he grinned and slipped his hand between the two of you, palming you. “I can’t wait for my birthday present,” he grinned.
“Mmm, I’m sure you can’t,” you giggled and then leaned over him to grab a strawberry from the tray. “Bite,” you whispered, holding it to his lips. He moved his tongue in a circle around it and then bit it sensually. You giggled and waited for him to swallow before leaning in and licking a drop of juice off the corner of his mouth, kissing down his neck while you played with his hair. You pulled away and finished the strawberry, giggling as you reached your tongue to the side to lick a drop of stray juice off your lips. He groaned and suddenly flipped the two of you over.
“That’s not fair,” he said, bright eyes shining mischievously. “You got to lick mine.”
“Well if it bothers you so much you can lick this,” you said, reaching for another strawberry, turning your neck in the process. His lips found your neck before you could grab another berry an he placed kisses down your throat, licking at it occasionally.
“Don’t mind if I do,” he chuckled at some point, pulling your panties down while he continued to tease you. You knew it was only a matter of time before he stopped attempting to be cute, and you were eager for that time to come.
It came soon enough as he, without warning, slipped his fingers into you. You groaned and bucked your hips, making him smirk. He started to pump you with one hand and with the other he pulled a bullet vibrator from the nightstand, pressing it to your clit. You moaned and withered beneath him, and he chuckled, loving how helpless and pleasure you were.
“Do you want more?” He asked, pumping his fingers as he moved the vibrator over your clit.
“God, yes,” you whimpered, bucking your hips. “Fuck, Andy, please,” you whimpered and he chuckled.
He turned off the vibrator and removed his fingers from you. “Anything you want baby, you did just miss my birthday after all,” he smirked before sliding into you.
“God, Andy,” you whimpered as he waited for you to adjust, “move,” you pleaded, and he smirked as he started at a torturously slow pace.
“Andy,” you begged, needing him to go faster. He liked to torment you.
“What?” He asked, leaning over to kiss your lips gently. “Do you need something?” He asked, and you groaned.
“Faster,” you begged and he chuckled.
“As you wish,” he pressed his lips to your forehead and then thrusted hard and fast into you. You moaned and sighed beneath him, moving your hips to meet his, the sound of your skin slamming against your and the wet sound of your convergence permeates the room.
“Christ,” you groaned when Andy reached down and started to rub at your clit again.
“You humble me, but I’m not the messiah,” he chuckled at his own joke an you groaned because he’d stopped.
“I want to be on top,” you told him and he smirked.
“What, I’m not satisfying you?” He asked and you groaned.
“Motherfucker,” you said, nudging your hips up. He chuckled.
“Actually I’m a girlfriend fucker,” he said matter-of-fact-ly.
“Bastard,” you groaned, clutching his neck and attempting to maneuver yourself on top of him, but he wouldn’t allow it.
“It’s my birthday, let me be on top,” he said, as though you had any other option.
“Andy, just move, please,” you told him and he chuckled.
“As you wish,” he smiled, leaning forward and kissing you again, softly, lovingly.
“I love you,” you told him with a smile as he started to thrust into you, you weren’t far from the edge and his vigorous treatment of your clit sent you over the edge. You screamed your orgasm and his thrusts became sloppy as he to tipped over the edge.
“Fuck,” you sighed as he collapsed on top of you, both of you a sweaty mass.
“I already did, it was wonderful,” he chuckled, kissing your forehead.
“Happy late birthday,” you laughed, reaching for his present. You put it in his hand and he ignored it.
“Sleep,” he said, rolling off of you but keeping you help close.
“Fine,” you smiled, and he laughed, kissing your forehead.
“I loved my present,” he told you and you laughed.
“I’m sure you’ll love the other one more, you’ll be able to use it more than once.” You giggled and he shook his head slightly.
“I’m going to use this one more than once too, don’t worry,” he chuckled and you rolled your eyes.
“Shut up or I won’t let you sleep,” you told him, resting against him.
“Okay,” he said in a sort of tired voice. “I’ll just play with my present again,” he chuckled, running his hand up your leg.
“No,” you told him, smacking his hand.
“Fine,” he groaned, and you smirked.
“I love you,” you giggled.
“I love you too,” he smiled, kissing your temple again and then going silent.
You fell asleep in his arms, wanting to shower, but to content in his arms to move.

Daddy Andy Smut-ish
NSFW Andy/Ashley/(Y/N) Smut, Daddy Kink, Discipline, Threesome, Possible Trigger
~
You bit your lip and forced yourself not to cry out as Daddy Andy’s hand made context with your ass for the third time. You were receiving five spankings as punishment for the time when you’d attempted to discreetly masturbate while on the phone with him while he was on tour. You’d thought you were being clever, but you hadn’t fooled him for a second, and he hadn’t forgotten.
He ran his fingertips lightly over your spine, making you arch your back slightly at his touch, secretly enjoying the pain that was building your anticipation for later that night. He chuckled at your reaction and then another hard smack reigned down on your already sore ass.
“You were a bad girl,” he murmured. It was the first thing he’s said since ordering you to strip and kneel on all fours. His hand ran over your ass down the the already damp area between your thighs. “Tell Daddy why you were a bad girl,” he asked softly, his finger gently rolling over your clit, making it hard for you to stay silent.
“I- I missed Daddy,” you whimpered as he added pressure to the sensitive bead.
“Daddy missed you too, angel,” he laughed in that way that told you he was enjoying watching you squirm. You weren’t allowed to make any noise that wasn’t speech, or he’d punish you. You heard him unzip his pants and struggle slightly to free his cock. You felt the head rub over your entrance and your stomach tensed in anticipation. You were so ready to feel him inside you.
“Tell Daddy you’re sorry for trying to trick him,” he said pressing the head against your entrance, nearly breaching it, but then stopping short and pulling back, rubbing his hard cock teasingly over your ass and thighs.
“I’m sorry Daddy, I just missed you too much,” you whispered, and he chuckled. There was a silence tense with your anticipation of the last hit, and then you felt it, hard and firm, and you cried out, unable to control yourself because the action was so sudden.
He clicked his tongue at you, tsk-ing. “Bad bad girl,” he murmured, patting your back softly, indicating that he wanted you to turn over. You laid on your back and he shook his head.
“Up, baby,” he murmured as he strokes his cock gently, “I want your pretty little lips wrapped around my cock, suck it like the cock slut you are,” he smirked and you obeyed without reluctance, running your tongue around the tip before slowly taking him into your mouth as deep as you could, which wasn’t very deep.
When you started to bob your head he groaned a little bit. He put one hand on the back of your head, moving you at a faster pace and then with the other he traced the tattoo on your shoulder, the one that said his name, subtly reminding you that you were his. You loved every moment of it. You loved his dominance. You loved how he took what he wanted, but most of all you loved how he never pushed you farther than you were willing to go. The combination of the pain on the verge of pleasure and the sheer lust you had for his dominance made you love how wonderful a Daddy he was.
“Get on your back,” he whispered as he pulled your head away from his cock. You did as you were told, gracelessly, but that just made his eyes soften for a moment into the love that existed both inside and outside of the bedroom.
“Knees bent,” he said softly, his low voice resonating in your core and his blue eyes piercing your naked flesh, making you wetter as they ran hungrily up and down your body. You pulled your knees up and spread your legs for him, and he smiled at your freshly groomed pussy.
“Beautiful,” he murmured, kneeling on the bed and bending to kiss your stomach. He looked up at you and smiled evilly. “Don’t cum,” he commanded, and you nodded, breath already caught. This was your favorite of all his games. He’d work you to the edge, over and over until you couldn’t take anymore. It was deliciously frustrating.
He smirked up at you, and his face dipped between your legs. He used his hands to push your legs further apart and ran his tongue teasingly along your slit, toying with your entrance and the bead of your clitoris.
“C-can I make noise?” You stumbled out, holding onto the sheets as you braced yourself for what was coming.
He chuckled and lightly nipped your clit. “No.”
You silently groaned and he smirked. “Be a good girl for Daddy, or he won’t let you cum,” he murmured before going back to his ministrations. You swallowed hard as his fingers sought out your tight hole, coating them one by one in your own juices as his tongue played with your clit. He slipped a single digit inside, and started to slowly pump it. You weren’t as tight as he expected you to be and you could see it in the slightly surprised look that crossed his face when he slipped his finger in. You dreaded him asking why. You had been more than a little bit bad earlier that afternoon.
“You’ve been playing here, bad girl,” he chuckled, moving his finger a little faster as he bent to lick at your bare tits, bouncing from the force of his finger thrusting inside you.
“Did you think of Daddy, and tell the truth,” he murmured, pushing another finger into your hole and speeding up. You swallowed hard. This wouldn’t be good
“N-no,” you told him, knowing lying made punishments worse. You had been thinking of Daddy, but by the time you came you were thinking of Ashley.
“Who did you think of, baby girl?” He asked, his fingers taking on an angry pace and you couldn’t help the moan that escaped your lips. His two fingers immediately stilled within you.
“Answer,” he commanded, his voice angry.
“A-Ashley,” you admitted and he growled.
He went to his discarded jacket, and pulled his phone out of his pocket. He unlocked it and showed you as he dialed Ashley’s number.
“Yo?” Ashley said and your stomach tightened uncomfortably as Andy smirked at you.
“Hey, Ash, baby girl needs a little something more today, would you mind coming by and helping me sate my little whore?” Andy asked, and you swallowed hard, hoping Ashley would say no. You weren’t so lucky. Ashley chuckled, switching from nice fun loving Ashley to Daddy Ash.
“No problem, I’ll be right over, don’t make her cum before I get there, will yeah?” He asked and Andy chuckled.
“I was planning on it.”
“Great, see you soon, princess,” Ashley said shortly before hanging up.
Andy smirked at you and when he saw the slight fear that was always in your eyes when he occasionally brought Ashley into the bedroom he frowned.
“Do you remember his safe words?” he questioned, and you nodded.
“Remind me,” he said, knowing he was just getting you ready to use them. You always had to.
“B-black,” you whispered, “gray, white.”
“Good girl,” he kissed your forehead.
“Daddy,” you said softly, afraid to meet his eyes, “No gags, please. Last time I- I was trying to use the safe word, and-”
“Shh,” he murmured, kissing your lips gently. “No gags, I promise.”
“Thank you,” you replied, and he smiled.
“I’m sorry we pushed you too far, my love,” he kissed your lips again, tenderly.
“Why were you thinking of Ash?” He asked curiously, knowing that you didn’t usually fantasize about other men.
“It was an accident,” you told him, and he smiled.
“And where was Daddy while you had this little accident?” he asked, still smiling slightly.
“Watching,” you told him, “Daddy was in the corner, watching with his blue eyes on fire. You were angry, but not bad angry,” you tried to explain, and he chuckled.
“What’s ‘good’ angry?” he questioned and you bit your lip.
“You- you were jacking yourself off slowly, and kept telling me that once Ash was done with me you were going to fuck me so hard I couldn’t walk,” you shuddered at the memory.
He chuckled, “Ash fucks harder than I do, I’m a much gentler Daddy,” he said, and started moving his fingers towards your entrance.
“But- not this time,” you told him as he slipped two fingers inside you and started preparing you, knowing Ashley wouldn’t. “He-he was gentle this time, but Daddy-” you shuddered.
“Was daddy rough with you?” he asked, and you nodded.
“I like when Daddy’s rough,” you told him, and he chuckled.
“I’ll remember that, kitten,” he whispered and then started to pump his fingers faster. You groaned, and his hand came down across your thigh.
“No noise,” he reminded you, and you nodded, biting your lip and forcing yourself to be silent and he worked you up. He used his other hand to start working your clit and and soon you couldn’t keep still. You were withering beneath his touch and every time you failed to keep silent he pulled his hand away from your clit only to bring it back down hard enough to sting.
“Daddy, I’m close,” you tried to warn him, and he shook his head at you, eyes practically glittering as he watched you begin to come undone.
“Don’t you dare, Ash would be furious,” he reminded you, but he didn’t slow his face.
“Andy, please,” you whimpered and he chuckled.
“Andy’s not here right now,” he murmured, moving his fingers even faster, “it’s just Daddy.”
“DADDY!” You screamed as you came on his fingers. He laughed as you panted and moaned and he continued to move his fingers as you rode out your high.
“Didn’t I say to wait for me, princess?” You heard Ash call from the door, and Andy chuckled.
“He did say to wait, and just think, if you’d have held out a few more seconds you would’ve been in the clear,” Andy murmured, still moving his fingers slowly inside you as he ran the hand that had been stroking your clit over your leg and stomach. “You were so close.”
“But not close enough,” Ash laughed in that scary way he laughed.
Ash approaches the bed, and slipped his shirt off throwing it to the side. He tousled his hair and you remembered why you were so attracted to him.
“Hey, Ash, come with me for a second,” Andy said, point towards the door, and Ash looked at you hungrily and grudgingly obliged.
You just laid in bed, knowing that when they came back whatever scheme they were coming up with now would be initiated. You just started at the ceiling and tried to hear them, but they were talking too softly to be audible.
When they finally came back into the room you had long since decided to close your eyes and just wait patiently.
“What an angel,” Ash said, sitting next to you on the bed. You looked up at his smiling brown eyes curiously, and he just leaned in to kiss you. Your eyes went wide as you sought out Andy’s. He was standing to the side, obviously not happy, you started to push Ash away, but Andy shook his head. You didn’t know how to feel about this. You’d kisses Ash before, but it was never sweet and gentle. Ash was the kind of guy who went straight to the action. He teased you with his lips, and you wanted to enjoy it, but it felt strange to be so intimate and gentle with anyone but Andy. He was your Daddy, he took care of you. Sure he disciplined you, but it was never bad, and he never did it for no reason. Ash was Andy’s polar opposite. He’d push whether you liked it or not, and unless you said the safe word he’d keep pushing. Ash wasn’t the type to just subtly kiss and rile a girl up. What was going on?
You looked at Andy, who was still glaring off to the side, your eyes uncertain, and his face softened momentarily. He smiled reassuringly at you and then moved so he was in the corner, still able to see everything, but not in your direct line of sight.
Oh god. Had he… told him?
“Princess,” Ashley murmured, pulling away, but leaving you with a soft peck on the lips. “Is something wrong?” Ash asked, and you looked over at Andy, he knew you knew, and was teasing you.
“N-no,” you said, watching Andy grab his package palming himself.
“Don’t look at him,” he said softly, “focus on me, on us,” he kissed down your throat to your collarbone, running his tongue over it teasingly before kissing down to your chest. He kissed each of your nipples, gently sucking on them instead of biting like he was prone to.
“(Y/N),” he sighed against your wet nipples, making them form little peaks. “Princess, tonight is about you,” he said sensually into your ear, taking your ear lobe between his teeth and tugging on it lightly, the moving his lips to just below your ear, teasing the sensitive skin.
“Stop looking at me,” Andy said as your eyes watched him pull his cock out and give it a few light strokes.
You licked your lips before looking away, up at Andy’s intense blue eyes. He was loving how you couldn’t focus on Ashley, even though he was definitely vying for your attention.
“Daddy, I can help,” you offered and he chuckled.
“Next time you look at me I’m going to double your punishment from earlier, understood?” He asked and you nodded.
You turned your head back towards Ashley, who was moving his hand none-too-discreetly down your body to his favorite part of you. His finger gently probed your wet heat before slipping into you gently, curling and looking for your special spot. You groaned, and he chuckled.
“When did you say she could make noise?” Ashley asked Andy, who chuckled huskily.
“I didn’t,” he replied, and Ashley smirked.
“Don’t be bad, princess, I don’t like to punish you,” he murmured, bringing his free hand across your thigh, hard, reminding you he wasn’t usually this gentle. “But you like to be punished, don’t you?” He questioned with a smirk. You almost didn’t nod, but that would be lying, so you did.
“That’s what I figured,” he chuckled, bringing his hand across your thigh again.
“Ash,” Andy warned, and you tried to look at him, to thank your Daddy for looking out for you, but suddenly your head was whipped in Ashley’s direction as he suddenly thrusted himself into you without warning, causing you to cry out in pain.
“Ashley,” Andy growled, and you looked over at him. This wasn’t Andy being play possessive, this was Andy honestly beginning to get angry.
Ashley brought his hand down across your tit, and you looked at Andy, panicked.
“Ashley!” Andy yelled, storming forward and gripping Ashley around the neck. “Pull out, and get out.”
Ash looked strained and angry, but said nothing, knowing that Andy when he was furious wasn’t worth doing. Ashley pulled himself out, and spit on you. You saw Andy’s eyes blaze, and he growled, gripping Ashley’s neck tight, choking him.
“Get out of my house. We’ll talk about this later,” Andy growled. Ashley left, a glare on his face, not even bothering to pick up his shirt, and you felt the tears well in your eyes as Andy glared angrily after him.
“A-Andy?” You whimpered, and he shook himself out of his daze.
“I’m sorry, baby girl,” he whispered, and you nodded.
“Come here,” he said, pulling his pants back into place and beckoning you into his arms. You cried against his chest and he murmured soothingly to you.
“I’ll never invite him into our bedroom again, he promised he’d behave. Obviously the bastard can’t be trusted with my baby girl.” He kissed your forehead and held you close to him. He was always there to comfort you, and you were grateful for that.

Andy Smut
He was seated deep inside of you and you moaned as his fingers dug into your hips, assisting you in violently bouncing on his thick hard cock.
“Oh shit, Andy, fuck!” You screamed as she started to near your edge, not for the first time that night.
“That’s it, scream for me baby, ugh!” he groaned as he too neared his pinnacle.
“Oh, Andy!” You were sure his hands were the only thing keeping you from slumping over as your walls tightened around him. He cried out and you knew he had just filled the condom.
“Fuck, (Y/N)!” he groaned as he came. You whimpered, exhausted, and he pulled you against his chest, as the two of you can down from your highs.
“I love you,” he murmured, pressing his lips to your sweaty forehead.
“I love you too,” you murmured, still panting as a smile crept across your face. You’d never get over what a wonderful lover and boyfriend he was.
