I can never believe that MRAs are just as bad as feminists when they do not have a male equivalent to FEMEN
you should listen to the honeybadgers on youtube.  theyre actually really cool and talk about not only mra stuff but gamer gate and other nerdy stuff
For me MGTOW is the MRA equivalent.
MGTOW is just super retarded to me.
nah.  they pretty much just dont want anything to do with women…. that’s their right.  the most radical ones just say mean things about women lol.  i dont think you can compare that with FEMEN
So, I have a feeling I’m going to regret asking this,  but what is this FEMEN thing?
just a lovely bunch of women who dindo nuttin wrong and are trying to get their life back together.

rechargeables asked:
Also I understand the whole "history didn't just happen in Europe and America" like ok that's obvious but think about it: PoC and other oppressed people in majorly white places are going to focus on the issues within their own nations and whatnot. It's not that they're ignoring other nations problems and other races problems, it's that they're targeted by a local form of oppression, so naturally that's the oppression they're inclined to resist
anti-sjw-groudon answered:
First of all, its not poc.
Stop using that stupid term as if white wasnt a color.
As if white was a race. And as if all races except white ppl are the same.
Second,
im hispanic and im not opressed. You guys rlly stretched the crap out of that word.
I live in america. In the south.
And for the most part i dont get treated any differently for it. My mom, a hispanic woman with a thick ass accent, (or as u ppl would say, “WOC”) has been allowed in alot of work places with no diploma Bc shes a hard worker
And shes never whined about no “opression”. Ive showed her the crap you sjws talk aboyt and she thinks its stupid.
She gets rewarded with the oportunities and pay that she works for.
She gets what she earns.
If youre white, then by your own sjw logic, u need to stop talking for all of us.
If youre not, then u need to start talking for yourself.
All black and hispanic ppl dont buy this opression shit. And all black people dont have the same expetiences as latinos. So grouping us together as “PoC” is at best, insulting.

The reason we don’t include white people, is because, no, white actually isn’t a color. And we don’t include white people because we white people aren’t oppressed because of our race (there are plenty of other reasons why we would be ie: transphobia, homophobia, etc). And I’m actually really pleased that you aren’t blatantly subject racial discrimination and oppression wherever you live, and I’m also really happy that your mother is getting the opportunities she deserves for her hard work. But that doesn’t mean it’s not a problem for others. And yes, I’m an asian american girl who’s never had to face racism, but I live in a majorly white community and I’ve seen my really close friends be insulted to their faces and online with slurs and so much shit like that. Even if I’m not hispanic or black or anyone else, I can’t sit here and just let it happen. I’m not just going to say, “Hey, that’s mean don’t do that,” I’d much rather call them out on being racists. I would never say anything that my friends haven’t already said, because they’re the ones subject to it and I would hate to misinterpret their arguments. Please know that I really didn’t mean to insult you. And actually you explaining your whole opinion of the term “person of color” is actually opening my eyes and I’m now realizing it’s racist and that literally has never occurred to me, so thanks for that. I’m being 100% honest, I didn’t mean to insult you, and I definitely didn’t mean to group hispanics together with black and other races. I meant as someone who isn’t white, you have your own problems to deal with, as do blacks, and asians, and others in their own respective communities.
WARNING, VERY LONG RESPONSE. I STARTED TYPING AND…JSUT KIDNA KEPT GOING…SORRY.-by “we” i hope youre talking about SJWs and not about racial minorities.-white is as much a color as black is.  with that being said, if u wanna get technical, most “white people” arent actually white.  theyre more of light peach/olive color with shades of red and pink….thats if u wanna get technical.-we hispanic people arent either.  and even if we were, excluding white people and doing the exact same crap they use to do to racial minorities doesnt solve anything. it only ensures that IF anything comes out of this, it will spark a new conflict in the future. you dont fight fire with fire.  this is why wars tend to cause the next war.-there are alot of things that are problems to others that are not problems to me, or you. that doesnt mean anything.  everyone has their individual problems.  that doesnt mean there is a huge phenomenon of oppression happening in the world.  if the 1st world was actively opressing minorities, we would all feel it. not just the people who surround themselves with this negative crap.  racist jokes arent opression.  some individuals being predjudice towards you isnt opression.  you will never be able to control individual thoughts.  racism, in an individual level, will never go away. just like sexism, murder, rape etc.  but our society is not riddled with it.-what? why did you keep saying “we” when referring to white people if youre an Asian girl?-sorry it happened to your friends. but like i said, individuals will never be controlled.  i was made fun of for my accent (mainily by a black kid) when i was in 6th grade.  doesnt mean i was oppressed.  doesnt mean we live in an oppressive society.  it means that kid was an ass.  not just that, but you cant look at slurs and racism remarks so shallow. same with sexist stuff.  if someone doesnt like me and they call me a beaner to get to me, chances are, theyre not racist.  they’re just trying to pick off something that will sting.  so if youre asian, theyre gonna pick on you being asian.  if youre a woman, they’re gonna pick on you for being a woman etc.  the remarks are racist, the people? most likely not.  most likely those people have asian friends themselves and they were just trying to get to her in a way that will hurt.  assholes? yes.  evil white oppressors? no.-of course you would say something, theyre your friend. and thats nice of you. and it IS racist. but THEY most likely ARENT.  (KUDOS ON BEING A GOOD FRIEND THO. not alot of friends will stick themselves in an awkward spot like that)-meh, dont worry about it.  wasnt really insulting. like….i know when ppl say “POC” theyre not literally trying to erase all races.  its just a really anoying term bc it alianates white people. i dont agree with the method of treating the “oppressors” (note, quotation marks) the same way we dont wanna be treated. weather SJWs wanna admit it or not, that’s racist.  shutting someone up, disregarding their arguments, looking down at them, assuming negative things of them simply for their race.  thats the definition of racist,  SJWs cant come up with their made up definition of “institutionalized power” and act like their definition is the right one.  you guys need to take more notes from people in history who ACTUALLY made a positive difference and realize they didnt use hate. even if the opression was real, even if the intentions were good,  the environment SJWs set when making arguments make it really easy for someone whos angry to use the conversation to spread hate.  and hate spreads like wildfire.  at this point, most wont realize it, but all they’re doing is pretty much venting at the expense of white people. bc getting your frustration out and blaming other people feels good.  having a common enemy feels good. it makes people feel like they’re part of something.  and humans tend to like that feeling.  which is why movements always need to watch for the spark that can cause a wildfire.  unfortunately, there are no more trees left in any SJWs movement.  end fat shaming turned into false information about fat not being unhealthy and shaming skinny people.  movements for minorities turned into angry mobs targeting white people. awareness for mental disorders turned into attention seeking kids making up disorders and self diagnosing and saying that people without disabilities opress them and saying that there is nothing wrong with having mental disorders. and if they dont wanna get cured then its a-ok. the lgbtlmnopqrz++ movement went from people accepting gay and trnas people to the belieff that gender means nothing and that EVERYTHING is socially constructed and to the construction of ridiculous sexualities and genders.  to the points where REAL trans people are now reviled bc of the transtrenders. feminism turned into an angry mob of people mad about absolutely everything and reading to much into everything a man does to come up with a reason why its oppression.  its all really quite sad because it all came from a good thing.  but good things tend to have very strong potentials to become really REALLY bad things.  especially when they change reality to prove their ideaologies. instead of changing their ideologies based on the facts.youre all running movements that are suppose to protect certain demographics, yet dont even question why so many people within that demographic hate you guys. and whats worse? alot of you treat people IN that demographic HORRIBLY when you realize they dont agree with you (not pointing my fingers at you.  its just…about….every other sjw ive seen and talked to on here.)anyways, im sorry this got so long. i hope you read it all and i really hope you take somehting in.  even if i dont change your mind about everything i just hope youll open your mind to what im saying.  its easy to fall into these kind of movements and not see how much damage they cause.  they make u feel like youre part of something, they give u a sense of being justified to insult people and they give you a sense of comunity.  i may call them stupid sometimes, but its honestly out of anger and frustration.   i dont blame people for falling into it and i don’t think they’re stupid..   but i hope someone with an open enough mind will atleast think about the things i just said.if anything, atleast take this bit in.  if youre gonna continue to believe we need all these movements bc of some oppression that hlf of us seem to be blind to, atleast try to be the one who makes a change in your movements and makes it less hateful. racism is racism. sexism is sexism no matter what.  and you guys treat white people like garbage.  “they did it first” is very childish and makes for very unproductive results.P.S:  thank you for being polite.  but i really ate that the politeness started about the time u realized im not white.  treat everyone with that kind of respect.  if your movements treated everyone like that, they would be easier to tolerate.
Preach it.

except cis men can’t experience sexism
sexism and gender-based prejudice are different things bye
there’s a word for gender-based predjudice but i can’t remember it???its kinda like racism but….idk?….genderism…?Man this is so hard…
Sure, sexism is common towards women, but it takes a brain for someone who believes in equality to know that it can happen to both genders. As to most feminists, they don’t believe in equality and they want women superiority, so most of them don’t even believe sexism can happen towards males.

anti-sjw-groudon:proudgayconservative:doggyspew:proudgayconservative:One of my followers made this gifset, but then confided in me that they weren’t prepared to post it themselves for various reasons and asked if I would.
How could I say no?
Related news article. Fuck this. Talk about taken things out of context. He was referring specifically to the spread of ISIS in the ME region alone.ISIS is all the same group and they are clearly not contained at all, so fuck off.When ppl in a country of freedom, Where freedom of speech is one of our basic rights, is scared to post a gif set on yumblr, u know somethings wrong.
Its time we all start talking honestly about everything going on and stop walking on egg shells.
Bc our enemies sure as hell have no limits to what theyll doNgl, the word “contained” brings to mind communism…Reagan must be rolling in his grave right now.
U ppl rlly need to start writting ur tags on ur actual post lol. I hate it when ppl put inportant points in tags

The news: Christians are getting offended at the new Starbucks cups.
Christians: Actually, we don't really care. One guy made a big deal but really we're okay.
People: Oh my God you guys! Christians are getting butthurt over Starbucks cups!
Christians: No, actually we aren't.
People: Look at how overly-sensitive they are! Haha, so funny!
Christians: We really aren't. In fact, my pastor/priest just came out and said that there's nothing wrong with them, and that if you do have a problem with them, you need to get your priorities straight.
People: LOOK AT THE BUTTHURT CHRISTIANS!
Christians: We're not butthurt though. We couldn't care less.
People: WE GOTTA MAKE FUN OF THESE CHRISTIANS OVERREACTING!
Christians: Okay, but how many actual Christians have you talked to about this? Did you actually meet a Christian who had a problem with the cups?
People: ...
People: You're so weak for getting worked up over disposable cups!
Christians: I see this is going nowhere. I'm going to get a latte.

i have seen a few people saying stuff like “why is bethesda shipping FO4 if its still so glitchy” on glitch videos
fuck you guys bethesda glitches are the best part of the game; what good is skyrim if my horse doesn’t clip halfway through the ground, ragdoll, then shoot 90 degrees into the air spinning wildly
i pay for broken video games because i like to give developers the message that QA doesn’t matter
One thing I loved about games on N64, Playstation, and the like: if you shipped a game like Bethesda’s been doing, that game would NOT SELL.
Fuck this whole ‘lol they mod it demselves’ shit.
back in those days, writers for gaming magazines would actually deduct points off a score for glitchy messes

"Progressive" tumblr rn:
Me: Based on history and its actions, Islam is a violent ideology (which is true)
Tumblr: Not all Muslims! Islamophobia! You can't blame an entire people for the actions of a few! (Which is true also - but Islam is an ideology, not individual people. Being critical of Islam is NOT "phobic".)
Me: Didn't you just say all whites are responsible for slavery and racism?
Tumblr: That's different! Stfu!

Women voted 75 years before feminists always tell us they were allowed to
feminismisahatemovement:
A new document has surfaced which shows British women, of all
classes, voting in 1843, some 75 years before they received the
parliamentary franchise in 1918. History professor, Sarah Richardson,
explains what this discovery means and how it was possible:
Occasionally, just occasionally, you
encounter a document that radically changes your view of the past. This
happened to me very recently. The source was just a few scraps of
parchment in a box of solicitors’ papers in Lichfield. But, at a stroke,
it provided me with tangible proof that Victorian women were not only
eligible to vote, but actually exercised that right, some 75 years
before they received the parliamentary franchise in 1918.
The document in question was a poll book for the election to the local
office of Assistant Overseer of the Poor, in the parish of St Chad’s,
Lichfield in 1843. I was tipped off about its existence by a friend, Philip Salmon of the History of Parliament.
It was a schedule of voters, their addresses, the rates they paid and
how they voted. But as I looked down the list of names, some immediately
jumped off the page: Elizabeth Shorthouse, Hannah Holiman, Phoebe
Skelton, Ann Mallett… In all, there were thirty women playing an active
role in the election. Although I knew that in theory women retained the
right to vote for some local officials in the nineteenth century, I had
never seen any evidence of them doing so in practice. This lack of
evidence had led me, and many other historians, to assume that voting
was entirely a male prerogative before the twentieth century.
The record was compiled because the solicitors were the agents for the
Conservative party in Lichfield. The town was a highly marginal
constituency in this period, so the party clearly wanted to keep tabs on
the political temperature between parliamentary elections. The
solicitor would have compiled the poll book from the ballot papers
returned by the voters.
In the
period before the secret ballot, everyone was entitled to know how
people voted. It was unusual to have an election for an Assistant
Overseer. This was a powerful post responsible for collecting poor rates
and deciding how they were allocated. But the overseers were usually
appointed to avoid the expense of an election. All heads of households,
paying rates were entitled to vote. This was a very wide franchise, and
one that included single and widowed women.
A polling document from 1843 which clearly shows women’s names among those who voted
My assumption was that the women would be of
genteel status. But as I checked their names against the 1841 census
return, I was surprised to see the diversity of the group of voters.
There were a few women of independent means, owning property and land.
There were also women, probably widows, who had inherited their
husbands’ businesses. So, for example, the wealthiest female elector on
the roll was Grace Brown, a butcher, who managed a large household
including several servants.
Due to the high rates that she paid,
Grace was entitled to four votes in the election, which she cast in
favour of the Conservative candidate. But I was amazed to see many women
on the list who were far lower down the social scale including the
laundress, Caroline Edge, the servant, Sarah Payne and even paupers,
including Sarah Batkin of Stowe Street.
The poll book is all
that remains of an unremarkable local parish election in a comfortable
Midlands market town in the mid nineteenth century. Yet, it has prompted
a need to re-write the history books by providing the first substantial
proof that women were able to vote long before they received the
parliamentary or municipal franchise.
Sarah
Richardson is an Associate Professor in History at the University of
Warwick and author of The Political Worlds of Women: Gender and Politics
in Nineteenth Century Britain.

Obama On ISIS: I'm Not Interested In 'America Winning'
Throughout Monday’s press conference, Obama insisted that his strategy for defeating ISIS was working and did not need to change. On Friday, just hours before the deadly Paris attacks, the president insisted in a television interview with ABC News that his administration had “contained” ISIS. Obama’s tone during Monday’s press conference alternated between defensive and disinterested. The two-term Democratic president repeatedly insisted that his strategy was working and scoffed at demands to change his plan to confront and defeat ISIS. “What I’m not interested in doing is posing or pursuing some notion of American leadership or America winning or whatever other slogans they come up with that has no relationship to what is actually going to work to protect the American people and to protect the people in the region who are getting killed and to protect our allies and people like France,” Obama said. “I’m too busy for that.”
