GrapeSeek - The world's oldest grape growing and wine industry portal
Welcome to GrapeSeek!
After 15 years we discontinued our directory in 2015.
About GrapeSeek
GrapeSeek was founded almost one year after Yahoo as a directory of grape growing and winemaking resources.
Our banner network received a whopping 50,000 page views per month and helped sites such as WineSearcher.com and Robin Garr's WineLoversPage to become extremely popular.
As a result of the death of some of our founders we decided to terminate GrapeSeek, Inc. but to keep our directory and grape growing information and photos online as a free resource for grape growers and winemaking enthusiasts.
We also host the GrowWine listserver for the late Larry Paterson (LittleFatWino).
