I'm a 30 year old guy from London UK and I love filthy sex. Some of this is mine, most isn't, but if you're a woman and like anything here send me a message, we should definitely talk. Even though I was into watching this kind of shit when I was 14, I...

Anonymous asked: So Im interested in doing this with my bf and I know he wants it ~really~ messy. I look forward to the overcoming my fear of being judged and inhibitions part of it. I am concerned with the possibility of getting sick from the bacteria and whatnot from sucking shit off his cock. Is that a thing? Can it cause you to be sick? What can you do to lessen the chances if so?
In which case your boyfriend is a very lucky bloke.That is a huge part of it. The closeness you get from overcoming your inhibitions with a partner… Surprisingly indescribable.As for health concerns… The way I understand it, providing you’re in a monogamous relationship (the longer the better obviously) the risks are minimal. If you are only cleaning your own shit off of his cock straight from your ass then you don’t really have anything to worry about. Try not to ingest shit that’s been out of your (or anyone else’s) ass for a long period of time, (like sucking his shit smeared dick the next day after playing etc.) as that can increase the chance of harmful bacteria.That said I have never been overly cautious when filth playing with partners, and (so far) have never had any issues. The same with any kind of sex, just know that your partner is clean and healthy, and use a bit of common sense.Most importantly of all however… Take lots of pictures and be sure to share them with us all. Have fun! ;)
