The Perfect Explanation of Privilege – In One Powerful Punchline
“The Pencilsword” is a comic strip by Toby Morris, an illustrator from New Zealand. His most recent comic, “On a Plate” hits hard at the heart of the issues of concerning wealth and privilege.
How many times have you heard the “I’ve never been handed anything on a platter” argument in regard to social security and other social benefits?
Toby wrecks this argument by showing how two children can grow up, be loved and supported, and yet still have two very different outcomes.
Make sure to follow all the way to the end for the powerful punchline. This comic is an increasingly sad reality for far too many of this nation’s children and families.

Abe Offers Apology, Compensation to South Korean `Comfort Women'
thisisnotjapan:
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe made a landmark apology to South Korean “comfort women” coerced into Japanese military brothels before and during World War II, with his government agreeing to provide 1 billion yen ($8.3 million) to a fund for compensating victims.
The governments of Japan and South Korea agreed that this would be a final “irreversible” solution to an issue that has dogged bilateral ties for decades. Abe’s message was delivered by Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida at a press conference in Seoul after a meeting with South Korean counterpart Yun Byung Se.
“Prime Minister Abe expresses anew his most sincere apologies and remorse to all the women who underwent immeasurable and painful experiences and suffered incurable physical and psychological wounds as comfort women,” Kishida said. “The issue of comfort women, with an involvement of the Japanese military authorities at that time, was a grave affront to the honor and dignity of large numbers of women, and the government of Japan is painfully aware of responsibilities from this perspective.”
Hopefully this means official recognition and apologies will be made to all the countries harmed, further action will be taken to avoid repeating history, and it will shut up the deniers.

Limit(less) Recruiting LGBTQ Africans in Europe for Photography Project
Hey everyone, my name is Mikael Owunna and I am the queer Nigerian-Swedish American photographer behind Limit(less)- a documentary photography project on the fashion and style of LGBTQ African immigrants. I have been shooting for several months and the project has generated significant press, including features in PBS, OkayAfrica and ThisisAfrica to date.
Official Website: http://www.limitlessafricans.com
So far, I have shot LGBTQ Africans in the US and Trinidad with additional shoots scheduled in Canada in 2016. I am looking to expand the project to Europe in 2016 as well, and am looking to find 1st and 2nd generation LGBTQ African immigrants (north African & sub saharan) to shoot there. I am specifically looking into the UK, France, Belgium, Netherlands, Germany and Sweden but am open to other countries as well if there are opportunities there as well.
Contact to Participate!
If you are interested in participating or know people who may be good points of contact to find participants in Europe, please feel free to reach out to me via Tumblr messenger or via email at limitlessafricans [at] gmail [dot] com. Also signal boost if you can to help get the word out. Any and all help is greatly appreciated as we continue to grow and expand Limit(less) across the LGBTQ African diaspora!

Its been NINE YEARS and i still dont think anyone knows exactly why teen titans was cancelled
Same reason Young Justice and Green Lantern The Animated Series were canceled: Girls liked it. Bruce Timm finally up an’ said it out loud in an interview a while back when he was asked why in the hell GL:TAS had been canceled when it was doing so well on every front; DC’s animation department has institutionally decided that feee-males don’t/can’t/shouldn’t like superheroes, so even if a show is drawing in great viewership numbers and has great toy sales, once they find out that it’s popular with women and girls, they pull the plug on it. Cartoon Network loved Teen Titans— two million viewers for new episodes will do that— and wanted a Season Six, and the production staff was already in the planning stages for it; they were going to have a big arc about Terra and why she was Living Normal, and do a lot more with the extended Titans team members.
This is so fucked up.
To elaborate on this point a bit, the reason this happens is that modern television merchandising aims for total market segregation.
In a nutshell, it’s much more efficient to sell things to people if you can divide them up into tightly defined subcategories that have no interests in common; that way, you never risk accidentally competing with yourself.
This is why children’s toys (and toy sales channels) are actually much more strongly gendered these days than they were forty, thirty, even twenty years ago: one of the basic market segregation splits they’ve decided to use is “boys versus girls”.
Ever wonder why you see Avengers t-shirts that leave Black Widow out of the group shot, or Guardians of the Galaxy action figure lines with no Gamora? That’s market segregation in action.
The upshot is that shows with crossover appeal can actually be cancelled for being too popular with girls; they’re viewed as “stealing” the female market from the specifically girl-targeted media that rightfully “owns” it.
This is the sort of thing folks are talking about when they say gender roles are socially constructed, by the way. The gender split in media merchandising? It’s not just artificial, it’s deliberately imposed as a top-down marketing strategy. When folks try to justify it by saying “this is the ways it’s always been” or “this is just what the market wants”, they’re lying through their teeth - this is, in fact, the merchandisers dictating to the market what it wants in order to sell stuff more efficiently.
(Interestingly, the reverse isn’t always true: if a specifically girl-targeted show unexpectedly becomes popular with boys, sometimes rather than being cancelled, its merchandising will shift to court the male collector’s market. TV execs are so sexist, even their sexism is sexist.)
I’M REBLOGGING THIS TWICE BECAUSE I’M SO ANGRY

Star Wars Merch’s Sexism Problem: #WheresRey Highlights Dearth in Female Toys

“As disappointing as it was to see Rey left out of the Target six-pack of The Force Awakens figures, it came as an even bigger shock when fans discovered Hasbro’s popular Star Wars: The Force Awakens Battle Action Millennium Falcon set  comes with a light-up Millennium Falcon, a BB-8, a Finn, a Chewbacca…and no Rey. [Hey, she’s only the PILOT - PF]
“Command the Millennium Falcon and strike against the formidable power of the First Order,” reads the Hasbro product description, accompanied by the image of a young boy playing with the set. “Imagine its amazing stealth as it dodges asteroids and blasts enemies. Its movie-accurate decoration helps capture the excitement of the latest saga.”
The omission of Rey from the Millennium Falcon—the ship that she flies in several key Force Awakens scenes—drew sharp criticism from fans. It reminded them too well of how Star Wars studio Disney similarly treated Scarlett Johansson’s Black Widow this year in its male-centric rollout of Avengers toys. Despite playing a crucial role in the Avengers team of superheroes, Black Widow was included in only a fraction of Disney and Marvel’s official merchandising.
More problematically, like Rey, Black Widow was rewritten out of her out of her own scene in Age of Ultron products depicting her motorcycle-flying sequence, replaced by Captain America and Iron Man. Toy partner Hasbro did the same to Gamora, the lone female hero of Guardians of the Galaxy, who could only be found on a handful of officially licensed items despite the fact that 44 percent of the Marvel ensemble’s opening weekend audience were female.
“It’s frustrating and stuff, and it bums me out,” added Guardians director James Gunn of the Gamora toy snafu. “I had a big conversation about this yesterday with one of my producers at Marvel about trying to make sure, especially, that Gamora is represented more in [merchandise] and all the Guardians toys.”
But the difference between Age of Ultron, Guardians of the Galaxy, and The Force Awakens is that in the Star Wars sequel Rey isn’t just one member of an ensemble of heroes: She’s literally the lead character.”

HEY HASBRO!!!
IM SO FUCKING MAD
This is why my son has his own Monster High and Rapunzel stuff. If “boy toy” lines keep neglecting female characters, I will keep giving him mine.
I went to Target today and their entire Star Wars aisle was newly stocked after Christmas- and there literally was not ONE. REY. TOY. IN THE ENTIRE AISLE. Not even Rey’s PICTURE on a toy. NOT. ONE.
I have stopped buying any merch that neglects female characters and I think we should all start taking photos of stuff we almost bought and send them to stores and distributors OR tag them via social media explaining why.

This is a humble request to all those who come across this post, PLEASE REBLOG IT to bring awareness. My dad was traveling from New York to Long Beach and the passenger seated next to my dad filmed and uploaded a video of him sleeping. He titled the video, “Would You Feel Safe Flying With Bin Laden. Many Sikhs are mistake for Muslims due to the similar appearance. But Sikhs and Muslims are two entirely different and independent religions. No one Sikh, Christian,Muslim, Hindu, Jew, etc. should ever be targeted in such a belittling manner. It is NOT okay to target an individual based on appearance. Guru Nanak Dev Ji preached love and equality to all of mankind. As Sikhs, it is our duty to uphold these values and to support those who have been wronged. Please repost this to all social media sites to bring awareness to the local community about who we are and to create a safe environment for all individuals regardless of caste, creed, and religion. Also please report this video to YouTube to have it removed. Thank you so much and with all of our combined effort we will be able to move mountains and create a loving and safe environment for all individuals.
