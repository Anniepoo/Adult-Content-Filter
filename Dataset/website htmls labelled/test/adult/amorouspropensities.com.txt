Thoughts and other things I like. No more in depth stories. I'm saving those for a book.

TMI Tuesday
Courtesy of TMI Tuesday Blog www.tmituesdayblog.wordpress.com:
A bunch of celebrity sex tapes have been made public through fair means or foul. Have you seen any of these?
Pamela Anderson and Bret Michaels
Paris Hilton and Rick Solomon
Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee
Kim Kardashian and Ray-J
Kendra Wilkinson and Justin Frye
All of these. They're boring as hell and proof that just because you own a Ferrari doesn't mean you know how to drive it.
Today’s TMI Tuesday topic is sex photography and video.
1. Did you ever pose for pictures in sexual situations, or take pictures of a lover? yes.
2. Did you keep these pictures private between yourselves, or did others see them? Always private.
3. Did any of them ever get out in public with embarrassing results? No.
4. Were you ever videotaped having sex? Yes.
5. If so, was the tape ever made public? No.
6. Were you ever photographed or taped without your knowledge? Not yet.

Due to Blogger not allowing certain things, I've decided to get my own web site. It'll be ebonypanther.com. It'll be live in a few days, I think (somewhere around September 1). However, since a lot of people still check out this blog, I'm going to keep posting on this blog. The only thing is when I do post on here, I'll put a quick description of the post with a link to my web site where you can see the entire post.
