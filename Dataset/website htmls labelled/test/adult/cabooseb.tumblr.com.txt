How do you make the eyes of the models “pop”?
How do you make the eyes of the models “pop”?
Here’s a quick tutorial on how to improve eyes in Photoshop.
1. Create new layer2. Reduce the hardness of the brush and paint with black over the eyes like this:  3. Now change the layers blending mode to ‘Soft Light’ and reduce the opacity to 30%.4. Use the eraser tool to remove the black from the actual eye ball. Now it should look like this (I’ve increased the opacity so the change is clear):5. Use the sharpen tool on the pupil of the eyes (make sure you’re on the base layer for this part).6. And we’re done!
Here’s a shitty gif so you can see the difference:I’d highly recommend to do this to all your images as the eyes are one of the emotive aspects of a models face.Note: I’m going to be doing more tutorials in the future, so stay tuned for more!
