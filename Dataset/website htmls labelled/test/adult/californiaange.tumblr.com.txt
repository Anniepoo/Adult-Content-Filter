NSFW, Not suitable for under 18. I just reblog stuff that turns me on, when I can find it, that is. Skinny guys, nerdy guys, furry guys, guys in glasses, guys with nice lips, nice long fingers or nice long legs, guys masturbating, men in bondage, guys with hands tied or chained above their heads or behind their backs, a lot of fem dom, a little male dom, some spanking, some edging, and SO many blindfolds- a fetish that I had no idea I had until tumblr. Also, the occasional pegging and pretty dress. :)

masturbatorsanctum
greg748 asked:
How come when I have sex with a partner, whether it's penetration or not, I have a strong desire to masturbate within the hour, regardless of how strong the orgasm was? I've talked to others who've experienced the same thing. Sometimes that second orgasm is bigger. Just curious.
masturbatorsanctum answered:
There are 2 reasons :One of the strengths of duo-sex is the interaction between the partners. When making love, there is an exchange of caring, a gift of pleasure. Healthy duo-sex goes further than just the genitalia : it is as much a cognitive and an emotional encounter as it is a physical one. And even physically, things go way further when making love, as not only the genitals are involved but the rest of the body also : the caresses, the cuddles, the kisses, the visuals, the sounds, the words… All this adds up and results in an event that can be a formidable sensual experience like no other.Yet, as oddly as it may seem, because of the multilevel and multimedia interactions during partnered-sex, your genital experience may end up being diminished. For one because you are flooded with “distracting” stimuli (sounds, sights, smells, bodily sensations outside the genital zone). But also because you are focussed on pleasing your partner : good sex, after all, is to be found in both the giving and the receiving. Hence the apparent paradox : good sex with a partner will generally end up being fulfilling at many levels, but not always as much as you’d expect on a purely genital level.As a result, while it appears to make sense that sex is what should provide the ultimate feeling of satisfaction, often genital satisfaction isn’t achieved as much as we’d like because of the complexity of the encounter. Hence the fact that you may feel the need to masturbate afterwards, to bring your genital satisfaction on the same level as your psychological satisfaction.But, you say, I’ve had a strong orgasm ! Yes, you did. But the orgasm is not a genital phenomenon : it happens in the brain. It is obviously the result of genital stimulation, there’s no question about that, but it is also influenced and enhanced by other stimuli (visual, tactile, olfactive) as well as your state of mind and thoughts, in the context of your lovemaking. All these have an additive effect in bringing your brain in a state of superlative receptiveness to sexual pleasure. So when your orgasm is finally triggered, your orgasmic experience can be earth-shattering despite the fact that genital stimulation may not have been optimal.There is another reason too that explains that you have an urge to jerk off after some good duo-sex. Think about it : if you found the event arousing as it happened, you are very likely to still find it arousing later, as you recall the moment. Hence your desire to masturbate. In this context, feeling the need to masturbate after good sex is a demonstration that your encounter was great. Your recollections have the same effect as watching (good) porn : they turn you on, and you soon feel the urge to act on the resulting arousal. Of course, there’s always the possibility that one may feel frustrated and dissatisfied, and thus masturbate to compensate for the horror that just happened. But that is rather an obvious reason and it doesn’t fit with your question. I’m just mentioning it in case a reader wondered.In the context of your question, where satisfying partnered-sex happened, feeling the desire to masturbate afterwards is a result of your persisting psychological well-being, possibly compounded with the fact that your penis may not have had all the stimulation it would have liked, thus you rectifying the situation so that everything becomes equally perfect… All things considered, it’s all good.
I’m a woman who has this experience a lot after sex. Posting response as public service to others who have felt this way too. Thanks :)
