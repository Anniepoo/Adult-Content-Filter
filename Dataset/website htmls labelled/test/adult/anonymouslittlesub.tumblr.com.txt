18+ ONLY
Taken. 23. This blog is for me to write and
express about my life and being a submissive and little. bdsm and DD/lg, that kind of stuff. NSFW.
Goodbye </3
This blog is done for now. I called him Daddy the other day, and he didn’t even respond to it. He seemed awkward about it too.Every time we have the “do you still like this?” conversation he responds, “it depends on my mood.” But it seems like the mood is never. He won’t give me a straight yes or no answer, and I’m just sad. I’m tired of trying to hold onto DD/lg, and hoping he’ll be Daddy again.  I want to be little. I wanted to be cared for by my Daddy. We used to have so much fun that way, but it feels over….and I can’t wait for him anymore. So I’m going to try to forget about it, and move on. I won’t be on this blog again unless something changes. It’ll be better for my mental health. We’re still together.. and I do love him and he loves me. It’s just obvious he doesn’t want to be my Daddy. If you want to keep in touch with me I still use my email: somethinganony@gmail.comThank you followers for reading and being there for me. I’ll miss you.
