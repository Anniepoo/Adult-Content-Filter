The line is drawn, the curse is cast ...Another year gone, another year to comeMore downs than ups, i have to say, but i'm feeling surprisingly positive given the periodThe fag-ash coloured
whippet of gloom
has yet to snaffle at my dainty dancing heels this holiday season.I'm pretty much resigned to quitting my job (i could rightly cite constructive dismissal !)But, never the less, have had a few interviews in the last quarter.The biggest sticking points have been money'We" couldn't possibly afford to pay youAnd ...Age !!!Foly huckin tishI've become a 'senior'The big four 'oh' is a tappin' at the frosted window of snuggliness and i'm being toldthat i'm*ahem*too o.l.d for the job

like raii-aiin on yer wedding dayI was having a bit of a (very) guarded chit-chat with Fluffy as to how i'd been in contact with an ancient client of ours, when one of our training managers popped his head around the door to say helloAs an offside, i just kind of mentioned to him that company 'X' was more than likely to be 'back on the books' as we say, and that he should be/would be/ought to be pretty much into being associated with our thang ...'That's just soo ironic, when i first came to France they were just pulling out' came his replyEhh Quoi ? Kesispass ?It transpires, that me be being willingly, concsiously unaware of what's going on, had just discovered that the guy has called it quits - he's going back home to blighty !!WuckmeFackwards and stone the crowsWe've just lost someone with a wealth of knowledge and experienceA huge blow to all of usand Fluffycould'ntgivea flyingkfuwhat an absolute arseholeLibellés : Mid week

Ahhh am a maaaaaaan of constant sorrow ...Boy, am i in a spot of botherFluffy, in a pique of unusual managerness (or spite)decided that he'd send me a mailto 'highten my awareness and bring my attention to ...'bad debts from about three years agoUnfortunately for me,the words 'procedure' and 'non compliance with 'were all used in the same sentanceAaaand, to make things worserbeing that Fluffy is still in ass covering manager modeHe included all of WorldCorp in copy ...Now, i'm not that stoopidand ok, it's not cool to, y'know, 'oops',lose 2K€ for you companyover a five year periodBut it is part and parcel of the job,it's one of the risks that you do have to faceand it will happenWhatever :i had a visit from Fluffy's boss ...Libellés : Start the week

Why...... do we call music notes "do", "ré", "mi" etc ?The notation "do, ré, mi, fa, sol, la, si" was created in the 1th century by an italian monk and was inspired by latin religious chanting :Ut queant laxisResonare fibrisMira gestorumFamuli tuorum,Solve pollutiLabii reatum,Sancte Ioannes The "ut", difficult to sing, was remplaced by "do" in the 17th centuryLibellés : why

... better start swimmin' or you'll sink like a stone ...What with the lights going on at 21h51 precisely, i've become increasingly aware, that after what had felt like an arctic winter, the days are at last becoming longerThe plants and herbs have been succesfully re-potted and right now, i'm thinking of buying some tomato plants from the local agricultural market ... we'll seeAs for Fluffy, Marge, the StickInsect, The Whale aaaand introducing *Judicata* i'm done with them allUpon the insistance of Fluffy for us all to devote a maximum of our 'free time' to prospect for new clients, i've had to go up before 'The Comission' to argue the fact that hunting for new clients is a pretty aimless affair if we can't at least use Gogol (as we say here) to check out company websitesA longtime ago, ever since our trainee, Fabio, decided that our home pages would open up on bestialitydotcom (no joke !) Worldcorp decided that we were all a bunch of slimy reprobates and filthy pornophiles - internet connection was therefore verbotten for all and sundryAs from this morning, i've been happily surfing company websites, during worktime, scrutinising job offers ..Hey !!Don't throw bricks and stones - i work in profesionnal training service company, i need to know what potential clients might need :)Libellés : Start the week

Pourquoi ...
...dit-on que mettre le pain à l'envers porte malheur ?Au Moyen Âge, le jour des exécutions publiques, le boulanger réservait un pain pour le bourreau.Il posait ce pain à l'envers pour être sûr de ne pas le vendre à un autre.Tout le monde savait que ce pain était celui du bourreau, et personne n'y touchait.Voilaaaaa !!!Merci Balaj :@)Libellés : why
