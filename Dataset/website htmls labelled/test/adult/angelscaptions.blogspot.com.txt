Absence
I know I've been away for a while.  I've had a lot going on, a lot to deal with recently.  More importantly though is that, on top of my usual busy summer schedule, I have just started a third job.  So now, on top of my regular 40 to 60 hour week, my weekend side jobs and my house work, I am also working as a Financial Consultant.
Needless to say, this tends to leave me with not a lot of time or energy.  I do still try to work on things for here, indulge in fantasy from time to time, but I'm not going to be able to keep any sort of schedule.

Ah yes, summer.  When my attractive cosplaying friends start posting pictures of themselves in bathing suits and revealing costumes, thus reminding me that I know a great many people who are very attractive, share a great many of my interests, passions and humor, and would never Ever have anything to do with me romantically.
Because I'm ugly.

Weekly Comic 5/31/13
I know it's been a while since I've made one of these, but I'm trying to get back into the habit.  With the new role playing game starting to stabilize it is taking less of my time, and I just need one more delivery and I can finish my newest cosplay.  Now if the heat would just break I can be all set, and maybe start making more captions.  This is yet another comic from Loserz

Crime Doesn't Pay
This is another one of those ones that I had a fragment of an idea, but not the whole thing.  It took me longer than I thought it would, but I finally worked out the rest.  I've been in a very Korina Bliss sort of mood recently, too.

Stakes of the Game
So since I've been gone for so long, I'm trying to spend a bit of time making some captions for you all.  I've got several images that have inspired bits of a story, but now I'm trying to fill out the details.  As usual, I'm starting with simpler stories before trying to jump into anything really complex, but hopefully you'll still enjoy them.
This is one of those simpler stories, meant more as a bit of fluff and fun.  Once I saw this set, I knew where I wanted the story to go, I just wasn't sure how to get there.  Hopefully it came out ok.

No, I'm not dead or gone, but between ten hour days in high heat, running my role play and working on my cosplay, I've not had the time or energy to make any new captions.  The good news is that the heat is supposed to break, and I'm hoping to have the last piece of my costume done by this weekend or the next, so I should have time once more.  This is very exciting for me, because I've not made a new costume in about five years now, so I'm really looking forward to having something new.  And it is just in time for the 25th anniversary of Otakon.  So I really have to go all out on this and make it the best I possibly can (which is, admittedly, mediocre compared to what other people do, but I still have to try).
