IT CAN ALWAYS GET NAUGHTIER
I’ve
had a thing for this guy since we were in college, and I knew he was into me
too. We would exchange text messages, and we became relatively close. We would
talk about relationships and even about sex.
Come
graduation, we had to part ways because I was leaving for the province. I
stayed there for a few years, and when I finally returned to Kuala Lumpur, I
rekindled my friendship with my college friend. We got into a serious hookup,
and decided to set our first meeting. We were discreet about it since we both
live in small towns.
We went
for a few drinks on our first date. When I got tipsy after my sixth bottle, I
put my head down on the table and tried to recover. My college friend then
kissed me on the back of my neck. He knew I liked it, so he helped me get up
and we drove to his apartment. When we got to his room, I was lucid enough to
undress while he did the same. We kissed torridly and caressed each other’s
body. He sucked my nipples hard and he was really good at it!
He
moved quick; next thing I knew he was eating me and I was moaning really loud.
I was really tipsy so I let him lead. He knelt on the bed, and put my legs
against his body while I lied down. He was pumping me really hard, and it took
a while before he came.
Our deed went on for hours. He was really sweet because he even cuddled with me
after we had sex. But the naughtiest part of our sexcapade: We’re both in a
relationship.

THE BEACH TOWELS
I woke up this morning giving it a time for myself what
things that I haven't told you yet then suddenly it all came to me. I have
never shared to you my tale of loosing my virginity. Hope you'll find it
interesting and helpful as well.
My boyfriend and I lost our virginity together when we were
both 15. I want to share my story with you.
I never thought when we started going out that I would lose
my virginity to him. We were so young and it never even crossed my mind that I
might fall in love with this guy. But I did, and looking back now, I don't
think either of us really understood the love we had.
We had been going out for 4 months when we started
discussing sex. We talked about our parents’ views,
contraception, what we
would do if I fell pregnant and our own emotions and feelings about sex.
On 'that day', we went to the beach where we used to hang
around a lot. Lying on our beach towels, the discussion turned to sex (yet
again) and we decided then that we were both ready and comfortable enough with
each other to take the next step (we had already been sexually active for
sometime, but somehow actual 'sex' felt different).
We walked back to his house and went to his bedroom where we
had showers and got into his bed where we had been making out for a while when
he said,
"Do you wanna do it now?"
My heart skipped a beat and I started to panic.
"I'm not sure" I replied.
He accepted that, but I started to think 'Why not?'
Everything's perfect, the way you wanted it, so what's the problem?
"Make love to me babe," I whispered, which kind of
surprised him!
"Are you sure?" he said.
"Yep," I replied.
So he got out of bed, told his family we were having a
private conversation and that they were to knock then wait for a reply. He shut
the door and started opening his lamp.
"What are you doing?" I asked
"Condoms, no one's going to look in here!" he
laughed, which made us both relax a bit.
He got one out, got back into bed and started putting it on.
I lay on my back and thought. I wondered whether this was the right moment (I
decided it was), whether I really wanted to do this (I decided I did), and
whether I really was ready (I decided I was as ready as I would ever be). I was
so uptight, I wasn't nervous because I felt so totally comfortable with him but
I was just worried I guess - the way I am with anything when I do it for the
first time.
He finished putting the condom on, rolled over and said,
"Are you sure you're ready?"
I took a deep breath before saying I was.
I kissed him slowly, and then gently maneuvered him on top
of me and we froze in that position for a while, an unspoken gesture of 'this
is our last chance to pull out'. We kissed again, then I reached down and
guided him into me. I remember thinking 'what were they talking about, this
isn't hurting at all', but the split second after that came 'OUCH!' Only the
tip of him had been in me and when the rest followed, I felt myself ripping
apart. This pain must only be rivalled by that of childbirth and I'm not trying
to put anyone of having sex, what you must understand is first time sex is not
painful for everyone but we didn't use lubricant, so that didn't help at all.
But oh, the pain. I have never felt anything this bad and I
hope I never do again. I stopped myself from crying out, but couldn't stop a
little moan escaping my lips. He stopped and asked if I wanted to stop but I
thought I'm going to have to feel this sometime, it may as well be now, so I
told him to keep going.
After about 5 thrusts, the pain stopped and I just felt him
going in and out, in and out. I never felt anything orgasmic during sex, but
the feelings were pleasant and knowing that my body was providing him with
ecstasy was enough to make it good for me. I always enjoyed making love to him,
even though I didn't get any physical pleasure from it myself.
It lasted about 15 minutes and during that time he was on
top, then I was on top, then he was on top again. I always liked being on the
bottom better, I loved feeling his weight on me and I didn't have to do
anything, I could just relax and lie there and think about things.
Sex became my time to think. During those first few
pain-filled moments, I almost transported myself out of my body to just above
the bed so I could deal with the pain. The easiest way to explain it is being
in a state of meditation. My body was taking part in the 'sex bit', but my mind
could become separate and thinking of completely unrelated issues if I needed
it to.
Sooner or later he started to thrust faster and faster and I
felt all his muscles tense up and get tighter and tighter until he suddenly
shuddered violently and pulled himself out. He got the condom off, we put our
underwear on, then lay in each other’s arms exhausted.
What I remember most about it was how much we were shaking
afterwards. Our hands and fingers were shaking like leaves in the wind, like
they do when you are either really really cold, or really really nervous. All
we wanted to do was be alone and take in what had just happened (it all seemed
a bit surreal), but we were thrown back into the real world with a jolt, tea
was ready and could we please come out and have something to eat.
So, that's how my first experience went. I'm sorry if anyone
is offended by the graphic details but I wanted to make you feel as if you had
been through it with me and to understand completely my point of view.
For months afterwards I struggled with my emotions, fought
with myself inside my head about how I felt about myself and my boyfriend now
we had crossed that line. Sometimes I used to hate him, hate myself, hated the
people at school who never tell you enough about how sex really is, hated the
movies and T.V. shows that show you sex as being wonderful and intimate. I was
terribly confused but I survived and it really wasn't as bad as it sounds here
written down. But what I believe now is you don't get enough information in sex
education classes about how it really is and the emotions that come with sex.
My aim now is to become a sex education teacher and teach teenagers the real
bits, the things they do really need to know in order to have a loving,
healthy, sexual experience.
Please don't go away thinking I am angry about how my first
experience was or that I hate sex, because I count myself as lucky to had been
with a guy who loved me and to have lost my virginity in a loving and wonderful
way (even though I mightn't have described it like that). It is something I
will remember and treasure forever.

It’s payback time!
Some guys have a lot of nerve – ex
boyfriends specifically. They inquire if you want to have sex with them on
the
side, while they are already in a relationship with another. An ex that cheated
on me was asking if I wanted to make love to him. I agreed but I told him I’d
have to punish him. He didn’t care what that meant.
So I checked in at some discreet
place and texted him the room number. He was surprised to see my gay friend
there - I said it was a threesome and it was his punishment! I told him that
before he decided, he’d get to touch me first. He drowned his face into my
ample breasts, sucking on them and futilely trying to get most of them into his
mouth. He licked me everywhere until I climaxed. I kept on telling him not to
stop, even if his tongue was already very tired, until I climaxed again. I told
him I wanted more. He fondled me, I came again. I then found myself stroking
his shaft and spitting on it for lubrication, it was so hard and engorged. My
canal was also so wet and I had a very strong urge to shove it in, but I said
he had to be punished first.
He was probably so horny at the
time, too, so he finally agreed. I told him I didn’t want to watch, and that
I’d wait in the room next door. I instructed him to call me when they were
done – to his relief I guess. After some time he called me up and said they were done,
and that my gay friend already left as he showered. I couldn’t stop laughing
after I told him that I already went home, too. He cheated and broke his
promise, and I just did the same – albeit in a different manner. And if he were
ever to bother me, I would let his friends know what had just transpired.

YOU TURN ME ON
Fact: It is harder for women to get in the mood. In
case you haven’t noticed, we tend to need more “warming up” than you men, both
physically and mentally. And so there are some tips from yours truly on how to
turn on a woman.
Tip No. 1 : SKIP
THE GOLDRUSH
A lot of men tend to go straight to the “hot spots” and expect women to get
turned on right away. No, we don’t work that way. Start by gently rubbing her
hair while kissing or rubbing her legs. With this, you will set the mood and
without looking desperate to get laid.
Tip
No. 2 : GET A LITTLE DIRTY
A bit of dirty talk will help. Some guys don’t talk at all, some talk way too
much. You have to find the place in between. Remember, not all compliments are
a turn-on. So mix compliments with dirty talk like: “You look so sexy when you
do [insert something not-so-obvious here].” She won’t know what you’re doing,
but one thing’s for sure: She likes what she’s hearing.
Tip
No. 3 : KISS
HER DEADLY
Don’t forget there are other places you can kiss other than her lips, lest you
appear boring to her. Explore and find which spots she likes being kissed on.
The usual places: her neck, ear, and inner thighs; some even like being kissed
on the eyes and forehead.
Tip
No. 4 : STOP-START
TECHNIQUE
No matter how intense the foreplay is, you’ve got to keep in mind: You are a
human being, not a robot. It’s okay to gradually stop in the middle of foreplay
to tell her how much you love her. Being in touch with a woman’s emotions is
very important.
Tip No. 5 : CUDDLE
UP
Do you hug her after the act, or are you always in a hurry to put your clothes
back on? Do you just turn around and sleep without talking and connecting with
her? Don’t.

About Me
Angela Gonzales
Hi, my name is Angela Gonzales, 18 yrs old from Malaysia. My mother is a Malaysian-Vietnamese while my father is a Spaniard. I’m the kind of person who loves exploring ideas, connecting them and learning new things. I’m an open-minded person. I believe in the equality of MEN and WOMEN. I believe that women can also do what men do and that the bodies of the other sex are messages signaling what we must do; they are glowing signifiers of our own necessities. I believe in using words, not fists. I believe in freedom of expression. I believe in respect. I believe in love. I believe in sex. Yes, SEX. Sex is a part of nature. I go along with nature. My blog “Angela’s Confessions” hopes to make you aware or maybe make you think from a different perspective or in a different direction. All comments are welcome – appreciative, opinionated, and brickbats.
