Glimpse 7 - Roy Stuart
This film would be great to have on in the background for an orgy or sex party, even if it is a party for just two! It lasts for over two hours and amazingly timed well for us watching it with a critical appreciation, whilst having a nice long stew, reaching boiling point and then recovering to the closing scenes.I'm not one for the arty type sex films and as this one opened with a wide angle artistic pan up a staircase, I thought this was going to be dull and pretentious. But it wasn't. Overall, it had beautiful women with little to no make-up, natural hairy bodies, and a beautiful environment. Shot in a stately home in or near Paris it had opulent surroundings that together with the 'quality' of the women made me feel part of it. I felt special and lovely and horny.In the background were music and or powerful feminist literature saying it as it is or perhaps describing the beauty or effectiveness of a woman's cunt. There was no attempt to hide the tripods, the lights or the photographers paraphenalia. At one point when a pair were at it on a rug, the camera panned up to look round at the other people in the room. It was refreshing that there was no attempt to pretend it was anything than what it was. A porno. I understand the Glimpse series of films are a by-product of the photographs being taken by Roy Stuart.This film was a series of scenes, some were like a tableau. A confection of bodies and movement. Some brilliant scenes of women bringing themselves to orgasm that you felt was genuine and beautiful. One amazing scene with a woman slumped in a chair after having frigged herself to ecstasy, then has one of the photographers come over and physically lift her like a stuffed toy and propping her up in the chair. I feel like that sometimes after an orgasm.There was solo female action, women on women and women and men. There is a foursome scene. There seems to be a little fetish for everyone... shoes, tights, peeing, BDSM, kidnap and more. I didn't like the first scene. It started off promising with a willing bondage scene, men fingering and touching the blindfolded woman strapped up but when the wooden clothes pegs were applied to nipples and clit then I am lost. Just not my scene and makes me wince. There were aspects of the kidnap scene I did not like either.I've never experimented with other women and have no desire to, but it does not stop me from enjoying the look of these women's bodies and the thought of touching and kissing and going all the way with them. There is something so beautiful and natural about these women. There were times that the humour of some situations were shown, even if it was just a glimpse of a sideways glance. It is obvious that the female form is loved and adored. The women were rude and up for it but not degraded. I can not say enough, how beautiful I felt as a result of watching this film and have never felt that before from watching a porno! It took a while before I felt horny which was partly due to me wanting to review the film, and then because I actually wanted to watch it but in the end I just couldn't help but get involved with hubby, so we did miss a few of the latter scenes. Hubby was pretty much up for it from the beginning but he doesn't need a film to do it for him. He reckoned he would happily watch the film on his own and get satisfaction from it but I reckon I wouldn't watch it without him. After all, I'd need him to be there to adore me.It is a pricy DVD. Â£55 but is pure quality and for the length of the film is worth every penny.
