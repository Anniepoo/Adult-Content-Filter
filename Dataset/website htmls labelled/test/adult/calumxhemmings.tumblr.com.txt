Okay so I am going to get serious for a minute. I don’t think you all understand what happens when you ghost read fics.
Ghost reading is literally the equivalent going into a store, grabbing all your favourite candy bars off the aisles and then leaving without paying.
Yes, paying. Fic writers are not paid with money. They don’t do it because they know it will pay their rent or enable them to buy food, no they do it because they love it, they love writing and the pairing and to make people happy.
They do it for the love. Feedback is their pay. Show them that love and give feedback. Show them love, give feedback, don’t be a ghost. If you don’t do this, then at some point the fic writers that you love so much will leave. They will leave because they think that you don’t like it, don’t give a damn, that their words are simply not worth it.
It doesn’t have to be a 5 page manifest, as exhilarating as those are. A simple “i love this” or “oh my god” is sufficent. Just show that you were there. Give love and motivate the writer to continue creating worlds you can indulge yourself in. Don’t be a ghost.

sorry to bother you with this question, but did getting your lip ring hurt? like a lot or just a little bit or nothing at all?
i’m not really bothered by needles so it didn’t hurt it just kinda felt weird bc it’s a feeling i’d never experienced before. like if you’re scared of needles, just don’t look at it and you should be fine! but yeah there was no pain and i had a really good piercer and she also did @riotvancalum‘s septum and she had a good experience there too!
