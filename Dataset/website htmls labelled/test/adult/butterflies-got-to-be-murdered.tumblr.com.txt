Kill the butterflies
Haven't you heard? I'm the crazy bitch 'round here.

At the mention of Lily, Becca only casually shrugged and dipped her fork into the cake. She never really met the youngest Potter girl and thinking of her while enjoying the chocolate flavor was not an option. James, though, he was entirely different matter. Two of them may have been departed for quite a long time, and they’ve never really been – together? But she did have kind of feelings for him; ‘kind of’ because it was nothing she ever felt before and if she were to define it, she’d probably have to use one of the restricted words in her vocabulary. “This is actually quite decent. Darn it, I’d even make a decent housewife.” She mumbled against the fork, licking the cold metal between her lips.
“Weeeeeell….” She took a lungful of air, throwing one leg over the other as she pondered over the infinite questions roaming through her head. “Did you swim across the rivers? Or climb the mountains? Rob the banks? Break into the Louvre museum? Impregnate women?” she wiggled her brows, still quite decent at pretending that there weren’t any ulterior motives behind her questions. The conversation could’ve gone without any, though, because she was going to ask what she was really interested in quite bluntly anyway. Her playful personality and tons of obstacles between two of them made it easier for her to be brave around James; she’s got nothing, and therefore there was nothing to lose.
“Did you think of me?” she scraped her teeth along her bottom lip, grinning widely and almost innocently at him. Her grin took a single shade of confused for a second there, though, and she leaned closer to James to inhale his scent. It offered decent distraction from her question, because she suddenly realized how awful would it be to get a negative response and how much she actually cared. Her mind started racing, giving her the attention span of a five years old child. “Were you rolling around in my parchments or something? You have this earthy fragrance and it’s very sexy. Oh and…you gotta tell me everything about dance. Who you went with, what was it like. I like the decorations. Wish I got a chance to dance. That rhymed. Anyway…”

Jet of golden light flew right above Becca’s head, startling her while she was forcing the gigantic heavy doors of Hogwarts open. If her heels were just an inch taller, her hair would doubtlessly end up in flames, and thought alone was enough to piss her off….
Remains of the smoke still clogged Becca’s airways though she fought against them with rhythmic waves of her hand. She couldn’t but frown in disgust, despite the fact that it most certainly wasn’t her first contact with cigarettes. Tilting her head to the right, she pressed her nose into her chocolate curls just to make sure they still held the scent of her milk&honey shampoo. Dividing her attention would give James time to regain his composure too, so she gave herself an extra moment to place her bag on the table and work on undoing her coat buttons. “You should quit while you can. It’d be a pity for another Potter to die young and be used for muggle anti-smoking advertisements. Trust me, your face would not look good on those posters. They make your bones visible, and draw a hole in your throat and…ugh” she threw her hands in the air with the grimace and faked a shudder.
After taking it off, she neatly folded her coat and placed it on one of the chairs by her side. Truthfully, she had no idea how it happened, but she ended up in pair of skinny, black leather jeans and comfy, slim gray sweater instead of a dress. Being forced to always dress to impress, it was nice to have a moment where she could be relaxed and casual. James was never much of a details-guy and he already claimed to find her attractive, so around him she could be nothing more or less but herself. And with the way his eyes ran across her features made her want to be nothing more or less but herself.
“You actually doubted?” her lips shaped into a perfect little offended ‘o’ as she walked herself in front of the sofa, sitting herself right by James. “Feel flattered. I used magic for you. Wait -…” she reached out for the bag, opening it to push her hand in and look for the present she brought him. Within seconds she pulled out a box that was almost as big as her bag, and it certainly wouldn’t fit in there if she didn’t use extension charm. She placed the box in James’s lap and pulled the ribbon, forcing the top to open all by itself. It uncovered the not so perfectly round cake with perfect handwriting though. It said: Congrats for becoming most annoying Potter. “It’s comfort food. If it doesn’t make you feel better, it’ll probably kill you because my baking skills are…” she didn’t even finish the sentence but only forced a dull sounding, short ha-ha laughter. “You’ve got forks and spoons right aside…I hope you don’t mind me digging in cake as you dig into your head and tell me where have you been and what you’ve been doing outside of Hogwarts”

Jet of golden light flew right above Becca’s head, startling her while she was forcing the gigantic heavy doors of Hogwarts open. If her heels were just an inch taller, her hair would doubtlessly end up in flames, and thought alone was enough to piss her off. Though she was used to professing her anger through the countless jinxing spells, she was powerless to the brats running around her for she didn’t carry her wand anymore. Many would call her a pathetic excuse for a witch, a waste of talent, but all she really wanted was a normal life where she and people who she cared for wouldn’t be threatened. Leaving magic school was easy, but finding herself non-magical company turned out to be harder than she thought. People loved her clothing, they loved her parties, but being the obnoxious mouthful bitch didn’t make her very loved among people and to change that she’d have to let go of her pride - which was, uh, not going to happen. Despite her best efforts to deny it, Hogwarts was her home; and if you exclude the smelly hallways and dust mites, it was nice to be back.
Corridor ceilings were paneled with various decorations, some of them in not so complementary colors but it only added to the catastrophic look of the amateur Masquerade ball. She reached out her hand to stroke one of the stars on the end of the ropes, tiny smile creeping upon her lips - too bad she didn’t get a chance to be there. The mere fact that she was mentally still holding onto this place was pathetic enough, and dragging herself around even after graduation would just be downright miserable. She had decent grades, she could’ve applied for some position but the idea of being authority among some of her friends who are still students there repelled her. She might have been a princess model, but a respectful one nonetheless. Tugging onto her thick green coat with one hand and clutching the big yellow bag in other, she straightened her posture and directed herself towards the Gryffindor tower.
Only when she walked into the portrait of Fat Lady did she become aware of her lacking password knowledge. “Ugh, can’t you give me a riddle?” she asked, slightly bouncy on her feet, pretending to be in desperate need of restroom. “No, my dear, I’m afraid not." the Lady responded and she stopped with her overly theatrical act, though her expression was still as dramatic and slightly annoyed at this point. "Fuck. How about you call James out, then?” she batted her lashes in rather cynical manner, earning a glare and cold response of “Not your servant, miss Maliano. You tell me password or you don’t get in”. In all honesty, Rebecca was a second away from taking her heel off and shoving it into Fat Lady’s painted face, but for both of their sake, a 3rd year Gryffindor walked into them having an argument and proudly shared the password. Seeing the ugly women’s face as she flew into the common room with the student - well, it might have been one of the best things in Becca’s life since graduation. The common room was, like she expected, almost empty and people who were in there were mostly strangers to her. Mostly, because there he was, of course sprawled against the comfiest and warmest sofa in the room, concentrated on the swirls of smoke running out of his cigarette. Somehow this sort of royal comfort seemed much more comforting than the one in her mansion, and that was one big, luxurious mansion. Trying to be as quiet as possible in her heels, she sneaked right behind him, peaking her head just above James’s and opening her mouth to catch the smoky silhouette. That, of course, ended up infamously with her almost coughing her lungs out. “Jeez, Potter, what is this shit? Cubans?”

Adam dropped his quill in surprise when Dex stormed into his office, threw his bag down onto the ground, and plopped down in a chair. He was scowling. Adam immediately swelled with concern and opened his mouth to say something, but Dex beat him to it.
“What kind of murder has a longer prison…
“You know…if we had a kid, I bet he would be a lot like James.”
“What?”
“What?”
OH MY GOD THEY TOTALLY WOULD THIS IS YES ASLDJKFASD SCREAMING. WHAT

Don’t waste your tears crying because I’m leaving, dears..

What are you sorry for? Some dumbass Banshee killed her. Shit happens, we go on. I envy them, actually. Girls love sparkly things and bad guys - so it makes sense. I myself prefer tragic endings, actually, so I get that one too. I suppose I’m really destined to be a part of muggle world. No wonder you’re like on crack; your family consist out of artists and they are known to be biggest nutjobs.
Some call it egoism, I call it realism.
Isn’t that what you’re supposed to say when someone dies? I don’t know, I lack some social skills for not caring enough. I don’t love sparkly things and bad guys, I love when a story makes sense, has a decent plot and good writing. I never tried crack, so I wouldn’t know if I agree with you, but yes, we’re complete nutjobs.
I don’t find death as something you should mourn over, but get stronger after, or something like that. It’s natural process. Not very good with words. I don’t like stories that much, in general. I don’t daydream - just have ambitions and hunt after them in real life. That’s what I like; real life. And maybe one Disney cartoon or two. Nutjobs are awesome.

Haha, that’s a good one. You know what’s the word to call my mom? Dead. She’s been dead for years now, quite literally. Anyway, that sounds like this Ally McBeal episode where this one guy falls for this chick - you know, the one that played Dr. Cuddy in Dr. House - but he later finds out that she has a penis. Then he dumps her, and she returns later to ask him for a favor - he’s a lawyer and same sex marriage is not allowed, so she asks him to fight to give her one, with this man who accepts her that way. But they realize they’re still in love, and he gives a speech how she’s as much of a woman as every other…and yeah, I missed couple of episodes there. That’s the first thing I’m gonna update myself on when I return among muggles. By the way, you got interesting family story.
Assume? I take no doubt for an answer. I’m brilliant!
I’m sorry. My mum sucks but she’s still my mum and I will be upset when she dies. It’s impressive the amount of drama muggles can think of, my creativity and imagination won’t even reach that level. Like authors thinking about sparkling vampires, where the hell did she take that idea from? It’s ridiculous and peculiar. Also an author that kills every single one of his characters - what’s the point on making characters if you’re going to kill them? Even House is full of drama. I just really love things muggles create. Interesting? It’s a good word. Also, my grandpa is a drag queen, my grandma takes care of the family business and my mum is an actress with no talent but good contacts that are always getting her in plays and movies and stuff. My older brother is a musician, my older sister writes poetry and my younger brother has been to jail so many times my father is tired of bailing him out. I should write a book.
I absolutely adore your lack of modesty.

You know, just tell them what I usually tell to mine “You’re only going to have one Rebecca Maliano, so you might as well give everything to her.” Just switch the name, of course. Parents are weak on their babies, and we are, somehow in their crazy minds, forever babies. Thank you - I expected judgement, but this is really nice.
All means justify the end. Well of course. It’s very important for a successful business woman to be dressed well; Devil wears Para, right? You’ll be my walking sponsor and I will always have you in my home as if you were Queen of Great Britain. Come around at any time.
This could work. Well, crazy is the perfect way to calling my mum, I do that often. Judgement? Coming from a girl whose father got a divorce so he could marry a woman twenty years younger that happened to be a guy - and still her father didn’t ask for another divorce? Not something likely to happen.
Exactly. Hm, that’s true. So I expect you to be my personal stylist, as I assume you have an excellent taste - we have a deal then.
