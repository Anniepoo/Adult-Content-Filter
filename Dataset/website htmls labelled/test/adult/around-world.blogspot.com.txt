It shows how video games develop different skills in children. Technology has introduced many games on different subjects like literacy games, science games, geography games, logic games, history games etc. This infographic is a torch barrier towards the facts and statistics about the positive and negative aspects of playing games in the classroom. The statistic also shows how much people spent on video games and how it helps in improving educational skills. Many schools use video games in order to teach different topics as learning the fundamentals, role-playing history, designing & developing and social interaction.The most crucial and important things which one can develop through these games are creativity, teamwork, independent learning, multitasking etc. These are the basic skills which one should acquire for batter living.

Courtney Stodden Signs Deal For Reality Show With Merv Griffin Entertainment
Is the world ready for a reality show staring teen bride Courtney Stodde? We better get ready because 17-year-old Stodden just inked a deal with Merv Griffin Entertainment to produce her new reality show, reports RadarOnline. The blonde bride who made headlines when she married 51-year-old actor Doug Hutchinson in June, told the website, "We are so excited to be working with Roy Bank, a great professional in this business. We are proud that we were able to find the perfect producer for our reality show an are thrilled to be working with this prestigious production company."Ever since news of the couple's marriage broke, the two have been defending their love for one another. With Stodden's obvious obsession with fame, it surprised no one when the couple began talking about developing a reality show last month. Hutchinson told Australia's "The Morning Show," that they had been "seduced by a lot of producers wanting to do a reality TV show," and they were currently negotiating with a prominent producer. Stodden weighed in proclaiming that "It's going to be a reality show like no other." ﻿
