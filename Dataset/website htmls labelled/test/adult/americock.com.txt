How
Does the Design and Fullfillment Process
Work?
"I've
been around
hundreds
of graphic
designers,
marketing
agencies,
and creative
departments
and NOT
ONE can
hold a candle
to AG Advertising
Services.
Aaron
is one of
the rare
few designers
that actually
'gets' direct
marketing
and will
enhance
your campaigns
and improve
their response
rather than
set his
own agenda.
I send ALL
of my graphic
design work
to him and
wouldn't
consider
using anyone
else. He's
fast, reliable,
professional
and his
fees are
beyond reasonable.
For what
I get for
the money,
I feel guilty
that I'm
not paying
more! Bottom
line, you
are nuts
to use anyone
else."
