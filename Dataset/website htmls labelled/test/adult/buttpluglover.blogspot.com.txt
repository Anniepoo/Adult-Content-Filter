All About the Buttplug Lifestyle
All About the Buttplug Lifestyle
At some point buttplugging moves from sexual fetish to a lifestyle all its own.
Here you will find not only entries on my own plugging, but tips and tricks gathered from others about plugging, anal health, and the like.
If you're here, its because you're curious or are one of us -- you are not alone.
While this Blog conforms in every way to the TOS, this site is NOT for minors, as my discussions and any supporting images will be rather frank.
Minors, go away.

Hello again; and introducing -- Boosty!
Hi.
It's me.  I'm back.
I was a long time gone; my apologies to my followers.  I wouldn't be surprised if you'd thought I'd died or something.  Well, I almost did.  And recovering from that incident has taken a very, very long time.  Only recently have I been able to start being my old self again, feeling the love, letting my asshole feel the love...you get the picture.
Lately, I've been plugging almost exclusively with this little bad boy:
This is the Boosty, made by the Fun Factory.  I got him at Babeland.  I think this is one of the most intriguing plugs in recent years.  It's made of excellent quality silicone, so cleanup and sterilization is easy, the base is super comfortable (yes, that's really a t-shape), and once you can get your anus to open up for the first knob (which is sometimes difficult) then the rest goes in with a nice sensation.  You can wear it with it pointing toward your prostate or g-spot or away.  All's good.
This plug is so comfortable that I forget I'm wearing it.  I can pass gas around it fairly easily, I sleep with it in, and can bicycle and even jog while wearing it.  There's no danger of it dropping out and because the base is so tucked up in between your cheeks, no danger of it being discovered; unless you choose to wear tights or LuLuLemon yoga pants and bend over.  In that case, you're on your own. But even skinny jeans don't reveal the Boosty's base.
There are some other toys with equally high-quality silicone by Fun Factory and Lelo that I want to try.  That will have to wait 'til after the tax refund comes in though...toys are expensive!  That said, Boosty is $34, so while it is more expensive and better quality than the plugs your interstate truck-stop sex shop carries (you know what I'm talking about), it's nowhere near the cost of some of the really good toys out there, especially ones by Lelo.  Shit, there are hundreds of plugs out there that are cheaply made out of bad materials and sold for more than the Boosty.  Those would be rip-offs.  Do yourself a favor and save up a bit for quality toys.  They last longer and treat your ass better.  Stay away from cheap shit.
One last word before I go.  If you don't already have a "cleaner" - a buddy that will remove your porn collection and toys from your house before your family finds them - then GET ONE.  Make it a mutual pact.  Agree on parameters; i.e. when to take action, where house keys are to be kept; erase a hard drive versus removing it and storing it offsite.  Dumping toys in the trash versus storing them at a friend's house; that kind of thing.  Take it from me: the system works!

I'm still around
I haven't been blogging because I'm in a phase of my life right now where I can't plug often.  Doesn't mean I don't want to, though.
I really want this guy:

Hm... I wonder what the size of this bottle of cologne is? (Rochas Man eau de toilette)
Motorcycle exhaust plugs.  The long one is "small" and the short one is "large".  About 62mm diameter.  Almost 2 1/2 inches.

Back to longer periods of plugging
Long walk tonight with the fat dilator in my asshole.
I put the dilator in yesterday shortly after getting home from the gym, say about 7 pm.
Slept with it in - also tried sleeping with the long thick locking cock plug in, but eventually had to take that out.
Wore the dilator all day today, even while working outside taking down Xmas shit.
Finally went to the grocery; get home; they've forgotten to bag some of what I bought, so I had to walk all the way back.
Not that I minded much, with the exquisite feeling of a nice thick nub of plastic in my rectum.
Will try sleeping longer with the locking cock plug - I think I'd overdone it on the urethral stretching last night, so the tip of my urethra was too sensitive.

Sounding
9/10 French urethral sound. Compared to this, the long lockable penis plug is cake.

About Me
Buttpluglover
I'm a 30-something who happens to consider a buttplug as daily wear.
I don't think its any more freaky than piercings or tampons and I think they're a great deal safer!
I am just one of hundreds, maybe thousands, of people who wear buttplugs regularly --
not for sexual gratification only, but because they make me feel good.
I aspire to a lifestyle of wearing buttplugs 24/7/365.
While this isn't actually practical, I gradually move closer and closer to that goal.
At present, I spend almost all my time at home with a plug in my ass, and sleep every night plugged.
I often wear a buttplug when running errands or shopping and always when going to the movies.
One thing you can be certain of, reader, is that when I post to this blog, I have a buttplug wedged firmly between my cheeks, making my life a little happier.
Don't hesitate to email if you have questions.
