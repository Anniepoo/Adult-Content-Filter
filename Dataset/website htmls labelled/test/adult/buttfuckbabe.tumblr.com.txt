Things I’ll never tire of:
• pads being called “feminine napkins”
• shaving commercials for women where their legs are completely hairless before the razor even touches them
• paper towel commercials where the father bursts through the door with his son, tracking mud everywhere and breaking something, and the mother smiles fondly and cleans by herself
• kids’ protein shake commercials where the six year old refuses to eat his dinner and the mother smiles fondly and?? replaces his dinner?? with a drink??
• shoe commercials where a bunch of women are screaming hysterically and thus making me associate that company with agonizing shrieks
• cake toppers where the bride is dragging the groom because nothing says love and devotion like hatred and regret. these people are going into marriage expecting and even enjoying the idea that they’re not happy.
• bumper stickers that insult the person behind you because for some reason you really want to file all that paperwork when some inevitable idiot rear ends you out of spite
• when teachers divide girls and boys during class discussion, generalizing their opinions by gender, so that they basically discourage anyone from entering the conversation with the goal of understanding each other. now you have spoken for people you never asked the opinion of, as well as made sure that guys feel it’s okay to dismiss the perspective of women and vice versa. education = ignorance after all
• diet Dr. Pepper for men

Reminder that when you hear about law enforcement in your area “cracking down” on “sex trafficking” they’ve probably just arrested a bunch of voluntary sex workers and their roomates/partners/drivers which in turn forced trafficking victims and their abusers further underground.But y’know- statist violence against marginalized groups solves everything, right? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

The only time I wanna hear “not all men” is when it’s followed by “have dicks”

your life is worth living even if you’re “not doing anything”
your life is worth living even if you are “letting life pass you by”
your life is worth living even if you stay in bed all day every day watching netflix
you don’t have to be big, beloved, important, beautiful, wealthy or famous
there is dignity in just being
it is ok to be
you merely have to be

book-caps:
You are now 18, standing on the precipice,trembling before your own greatness.who say you are too young and delicate to make anything happen for yourself. They don’t see the part of you that smolders.Don’t let their doubting drown out the sound
of your own heartbeat.
Your bravery builds beyond you. You are needed
by all the little girls still living in secret,
writing oceans made of monsters and
throwing like lightening.
You are stronger than the world has ever believed you to be.
The world laid out before you to set on fire.
All you have to do
is burn.This is your call to leap.There will always being those You are the first drop of a
hurricane.You
don’t need to grow up to find greatness.―  Clementine von Radics
