For centuries mankind has tried to treat diseases using a variety of vegetable and animal substances of natural origin. With the advent of new technologies and production of Canadian pharmaceutical drugs on these substances was almost forgotten.
Moreover, because of its artificial origin they contributed to the violation of the natural activity of the body and led to the emergence of a variety of harmful consequences, one of which is allergic. In addition, various biologically active substances had virtually ceased to be absorbed from the diet, which led to the development of immuno - and vitamindeal. Humanity has solved this problem with medication - natural biologically active substances, whose main task is the enrichment of the human diet, making up for the deficiency of vitamins and other beneficial nutrients. Widespread dissemination and promotion of dietary supplements has served as the marketing sales, however, due to their great variety and the initial absence of rigorous pharmacological control medications have become the subject of speculation by some manufacturers.
On the forum you will be able to get recommendations on the use of vitamins and nutritional supplements, and get involved in discussions of the effectiveness of biologically active additives to share their opinions and experiences.
On the Internet is more than ten large drugstore chains, many of which entice buyers a statement about the lowest prices on drugs. To position itself as a "national", "cheap" drugstore very profitable, because believing these claims, people will buy here in the hope of saving. But how honest with us these pharmacies? Maybe their discounts is just a ploy to lure unsuspecting buyers? After all, logically, cannot each pharmacy to be "the cheapest": if a lot of them, there must be "expensive"! So, some of them clearly disingenuous. Therefore, we decided to conduct a mini-experiment and, not trusting the advertising slogans, check the prices on the popular drugs at different pharmacies. And this amounted to an arbitrary list which included the popular drugs that are in demand from customers.
We acted as would any local resident, if he needed to be treated. Just generally, medicines are needed urgently and there is no time to run from the pharmacy to the pharmacy in search of cheap, go to the next and hope that there are fair prices.
Another story - as we collected these rates. In the form of a man, intently studying showcase, pharmacists suspicious. And if even to get a notebook and start to write, questions cannot be avoided. So we had to act almost espionage methods and sneak to fix prices in the mobile phone, so as not to cause suspicion. Our efforts were crowned with dramatic results: those pharmacies that are most actively position themselves as "folk", offer the cheapest rates.
With the results of our monitoring of prices you can get more details in the table - look, draw conclusions. And now, before you believe the advertising, just go around a few nearby pharmacy and see, how much is there that you need the drug.
