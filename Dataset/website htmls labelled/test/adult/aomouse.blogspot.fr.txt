I am still about, just a bit quiet
Sorry I have not been around here much. When I got back from feeling
sorry for myself it seemed easier to concentrate on posting my captiosn
for people on Rachel’s Haven, so if you are interested you will find plenty there.

You Want Me To Wear That!
I just completed this caption and thought it was innocent enough to post up here.

You Might Get Lucky
Tom was pretty sure that Kelly had known exactly what she was getting him into. For his bet with Billy Tom had to sneak into the girl’s house and remove a bra and panties. When he had admitted what he was going to do he was surprised that Kelly wanted to help.
She gave him the sex outfit to dress up in then, when he grabbed the bra and panties from the laundry he could slip them on under what he got in wearing and walk out. At least that was the theory.
All went well until the dolled up Tom was about to leave and found himself trapped. A whole group of girls were heading out clubbing and Tom found himself unable to get out of it. A smirking Kelly said “Come on Tammy, get with the programme. You never know, with any luck you might get lucky”

The Picture Of Dora Gray
Well, I saw there was a version of The Picture og Dorian Gray comin on tv and thought it might work as a captioning subject.

Having watched this year’s Dr Who Christmas special, which I have been
anticipating for so long (and wasn’t disappointed with), it made me want
to make a new Dr Who caption. Which I decided to base around the fob
watch idea used in the David Tennant episodes “The Family of Blood” and
“Utopia”. Well of course, without a companion to watch over The Doctor it could happen.

The Cup That Cheers
As I haven't been creating images for a while I though I might at least post some of my less explicit captions here to re-kndle the site.

Sorry for the hiatus
Ever since my PC gave up the ghost and I started using the laptop instead I haven't found using  DAZ Studio to make the images for here as much fun. Added to that I have found Fuskator.com as a source for photos to caption.
The result is the break in postings. I don't kow when the inspiration might return, but if you look at my Anne Oni Mouse sTumbles Tumblr blog to see what I have been up to.

About the images used here
Most of the pictures that I use here are ones that I have created using DAZ Studio. I do this to avoid the possible copyright problems of using pictures grabbed online. It also allows me to create the poses I want, taking into account that I am a very limited artist.These images were created by me for my
own amusement. If you happen to want to use them please ask. It is a
bit rude to distribute or otherwise use someone else's work without
their permission or at least acknowledging that it is their work.
