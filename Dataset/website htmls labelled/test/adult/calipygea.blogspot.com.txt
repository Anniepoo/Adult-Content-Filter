Spanking and D/S Erotic.

Sexuality, openness & the web’What strange animals we humans are. What makes us so diverse and conflicted when it comes to sexual openness? If there is one thing that the internet is rapidly exposing, it is that there is an incredible duality in the lives of so many.Years ago when I was feeling very insecure about the rightness of my desires as a submissive, a very wise man told me that there was really no such thing as normal, that when it comes to love and intimacy, what works well between two people is all there is, there’s no external benchmark. What you must use to measure is only the lightness your heart feels when you're cozy and feel that all is well with your life. If you can go there together with spanking don’t waste time with worry about normal. I know he really meant healthy, since normal is a more statistical reference, but hey, he was dead on.The spanking, DD, and D/s lifestyle community(ies) have a lot to learn from the gay and lesbian community. They have courageously blazed the trail when it comes to garnering individual and community at large acceptance of sexual identity as a relevant, even essential aspect of personal truth. No they haven’t been completely victorious in winning total acceptance, but they have carved out many secure plateaus and steps in the process. They are courageously active when it comes to personal and group advocacy in the public domain. In my peer group of managers and directors at work there are a number of gays/lesbians. The question of their sex life is a non-issue and is not there at all when it comes to accountability and performance in their roles. They bring their significant other’s to company events, and that’s that. I know that I would not be living in as much fear of being outed if I were gay instead of being a submissive erotic writer and artist.For the most part we (spanko’s, DD & D/s lifestylers) have been quite cowardly when it comes to living out of the closet and advocating for legitimacy and acceptance. I’ve read and given voice to laments about the way we are perceived/misperceived by the world at large. Yet my now not so anonymous internet existence has been the only real venue I have ever spoken out in. Unlike my gay & lesbian peers, I have not come out of my closet to the world at large in any venue but my blog, instead I’ve cowered, using the anonymity of the internet and the comparative safety of subject matter groups and communities to make like minded friends and contacts and fulfill my need for kinship. All the while I’ve lived in fear that I would be exposed to ‘vanilla’s’ in my real life.I experienced one of those light bulb moments the other day. I discovered that for some time, completely unknown to me several members of my peer group and a few subordinates knew about my blog, and read it. There were apparently some questions raised, but for the most part they were answered and put away. I know how they discovered me. I’d found server footprints in my counter and panicked that I was being watched so I went to someone I thought I could trust. Without specifics I told him that some one was accessing my sexblog via a company server and that they had used something very unique as a search term to find me. It turned out not to be a USP from my employer, but a PC of an employee in a whole other city that happened to route through the same main server as us; someone using company time & resources to browse sexblogs. Yikes! But not someone hunting down employees with sexblogs. Well, apparently this person used what I shared & found me on line. After telling me that “any one who found my site was going to very much like what they found,” and admitting he’d found it, he promised me it was a secret & offered that he also had a site he wouldn’t want work to know about. That was where things stood until this past Monday, when the HR director disclosed to me that my blog, sexual interests and fictional life was well known to many people including herself.For so long, more than a year, they just let me be – never said a word, never wrote me off. Why? I’m probably not ever going to know, one because I don’t think I could get in anyone’s face and ask them such a personal question, two because I think each person has their own private sexual identity that warned them not to throw stones, three because they offered me a silent trust and respect that disregarded sexuality and even my lonely fictional reality on line as relevant given my life & value at work.For the most part I think the DD & D/s community has been able to hide behind statistics and secrete themselves behind the pseudo accepted mostly sniggered about BDSM sexual element. Yet we dare whine that the vanilla world doesn’t get us and doesn’t see us as separate and unique from that catch all world.You know what, it’s all irrelevant. As the internet expands and more and more of us discover what’s out here, and more and more of us break out and realize that we owe our personal growth to the exploration of our needs, interests and yes even desires, and more and more of us are seduced by what we find and dare trust in the perceived anonymity of the web; this whole issue will shift.The Gay & Lesbian community has courageously laid the groundwork when it comes to ownership of sexual identity. As a submissive spanko, I believe that hiding from my truth, despising and fearing myself, has contributed to some very toxic choices. Nothing past can be taken back, only owned and placed in a go forward desired to improve action plan.Here it is, my action plan:Be meOwn liesSeek honestyRethink reactions to hurtful digsDon’t react from pain or defense.

“Luscious.”Her mind wandered back over the sound of the word, the way it drooled from his lips, the way it matched the sinewy undulations of his fingers across her flesh; the workings of his hands, were a sensual brutality. A magical seduction that changed her from softly obedient woman draped prone across his thighs, to a puddle of boneless submissive poured into complete compliance right where she belonged.“Don’t take off any more weight,” the sharp spank that came with his out of the blue command broke her brief revery.“But I have 28 pounds since the baby that still has to go,” she complained, suddenly self conscious of the dimpled orange peelly cellulite he was massaging and squeezing and ogling.“I like you just like this. Your ass is perfect. Your ass is plump and luscious and your belly feels nice, warm and soft next to me when you lay like this. This is how women should be. Round and healthy, soft, with curves a man can stroke and squeeze.“Only if you close your eyes when you do that then,” she grimaced because her mate was again vigorously kneading, squeezing and pressing the corpulent flesh of her bare backside. Clearly the activity had some appeal for him because she could feel his warm once soft cock thicken and poke against her belly, and then as it hardened and grew in length, he shifted her so that it could slip up to a more comfortable place between her waist and his abdomen.“Close my eyes? When I spank your deserving needy backside? Now THAT! Is a brat thing to say.”“Ah Owe!” she complained, when he abandoned the massage in favor of more percussive play.“YES! THAT’s! THE! GEN–ER–AL! Isn’t it?” he teased her after smacking so hard by slowing down and patting in a way that made her whole bottom jiggle.“Aw! Honey don’t! That’s embarrassing me!” she cringed and buried her face in the pillow she kidnapped from behind his back.“What? You’d rather have this?” he laughed and changed gears again, this time delivering five solid upswinging cuffs. These had the effect of lifting soft flesh from her thighs to compress with that of her bottom and then resettle with a concussive gelatinous wobble.“No! mmmmmwwwwoooooooo!” she shook her head no and pressed her face farther into the pillow.He grinned and let up on the tease. Nothing he could tell her about how well he loved her body could carry as much weight as how he showed her. The tease was fun, but could go too far. Pregnancy hormones had not yet left the scene and looking the way she wanted to look was too important to her for a part of her self image that had nothing to do with his sexual desire.“You have one of the very best asses ever crafted by nature,” he left off the teasing and proceeded with the spanking he’d been looking forward to administering all weekend.Well spanked, her bottom burning, dewy ‘almost’ tears glistening on her eyelashes, she climbed up to straddle and settle in his lap, kissing him with her “thank you” and then rested against him, soft, pliant and his. He’s let his vixen cum while being spanked. Having allowed it, he now felt he should wait out the few moments while she reveled, before he put her to work. It wasn’t a long wait. His vixen was a slut, and she felt his rock hard cock pulse between their bellies. In seconds she was teasing it, pressing and stroking with the muscles of her lower abdomen, and then she lifted and stroked him with her whole front.“Don’t tease b***h,” he chuckled through clenched teeth.“No?” she purred. “What will you do to me if I do?”“Do you want to find out?” he growled.“Hummm hmmmmm.” she nodded, stretching up, shifting, taking him in her hand, and then easing back, pressing his thick cock inside her before settling back down fully in his lap.”Geezus!” he hissed.The best way to start a gal on top ride is the have her man grip one breast in one hand and her worst spanked ass in the other. She guided those dominant hands to their requisite places and began to grind and circle and stroke his cock at a comfortably sensual cadence. Squeezing the muscles of her pelvic floor and varying her rhythm from time to time seemed to be an effect cue for him to switch hands so that both of her breast were properly massaged, soaking both of their stomachs with milk, even after he’d enjoyed his fill of her sweet nectar.Far too soon yet on the brink of desperation, both felt the inevitable tug to crest the roller coaster.“Fuck me!” their voices were as one.She pressed her pussy down hard and ground and stroked for all she was worth. He pressed up inside her circling and grinding his glans hard against her firm inner parts. Now and then withdrawal and long thrusts were in order if only so that breath and rhythm could be restored, but it was the vigorous and even brutal deep contact that clawed the edge closer until both exploded up and off it.The real coupling followed the *fuckling.*“Your body is luscious and perfect,” he whispered as he drifted into comfortable sleep.“What will you do to me?” she sighed and tumbled into dreams where her luscious body fell victim to so many sensual tortures.They’d reached resolution, though neither had nor for the moment needed a single tangible answer from the other. When it works it works, when it’s great, for the vast majority of us the possibilities always have time and will give us more changes. When the moment is good, keep it and revel in it the future does not belong in the reverie of now. When it’s right and all the work is done … trust building, love security, health what could be from dreams & shared fantasies will find their way out almost invisibly; just through an accumulation of ‘right now’s’ that stacked up and became WOW!I love fuckling thoug don’t you? That cozy after fucking when deepest thoughts dribble out in the warm glow and yet memory only ever catches it when it matters.
