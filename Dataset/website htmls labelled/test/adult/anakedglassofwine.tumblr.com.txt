Look at my adorable socks! I really only wanted to take a photo for that reason.

A bright and joyful Christmas to all!
And here‚Äôs hoping you have something adorable under your tree. Or in front of your very little tree. Or posed next to a really sweet orange velour chair. Or near a naked couch since the slipcover is in the washing machine.
You know, really whatever makes your season bright.

I was reminded that it is the season of giving and I have been withholding cute photos. Apologies to Santa, Elf on the Shelf, Mensch on a Bench, etc.
So remember my super cute tree from last year? Yeah I determined that it is a LOT of work to procure, transport, and install a tree that is taller than myself on my own. And the minor detail regarding the
pup absolutely eyeing me like, ‚ÄòDingbat, Frank Lloyd Wright built AROUND the tree. You don‚Äôt bring a dead one into an already-built house.‚Äô
This year I remembered that I had an artificial tree somewhere in the rafters of the garage. What I did not remember was that it was a midget tree.
Does it look larger if I kneel in front of it?

What are we doing?
Raking leaves!
How are we doing it?
NOT in our underwear!
I mean, it‚Äôs probably just never a good idea to do yard work in underwear. WHAT IF THE POSSUM RETURNS FOR VENGEANCE?!

Don‚Äôt chase people. Be an example. Attract them. Work hard and be yourself. The people who belong in your life will come find you. Just do your thing.

Questione di naso :) üê∂‚ù§Ô∏è
Because I absolutely love my dog. Even if last night he dragged a dead possum through the house. Multiple times. And then I realized it and made him leave it in the yard. Upon investigating, I discovered the possum was in fact NOT dead. And that I do not own a shovel. So I freaked out and called my dad. Who proceeded to laugh at me and make suggestions like throwing said possum into my neighbor‚Äôs yard. Which is a bit redneck, but I may have done it except for the lack of shovel.Grown-ass female does not mean equipped to handle partially dead furry things.

It‚Äôs been awhile, eh?
So today I started Christmas shopping. I love giving carefully chosen gifts, so I bought books for a few people. I treasure wandering through a bookstore and trying to find the right match. Books are intimate, don‚Äôt you think? Seeking what inspires a friend to curl up and shut the world out? Or perhaps understanding that someone is slogging through a rough patch and needs a laugh or inspiration.
Know what tickles their neurons and you know the core of a person.

Some random but never pointless thoughts:
I apparently am attacking myself in my sleep. I keep finding new scratches and dings.
This is proof I don‚Äôt only own Lululemon pants. Except I don‚Äôt really like these tights.
Saturday work is for the flipping birds.
I had a woman say to me this week, ‚ÄòMen want to be needed. I‚Äôm not very good at playing 'in distress.‚Äô Guess that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm single.‚Äô Having experienced this, I was able to nod in agreement while commiserating in the ridiculousness.
Intelligence is hot. Way hotter than back wings. But I see no reason to have to choose.
