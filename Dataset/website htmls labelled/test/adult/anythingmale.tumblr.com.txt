Hmmmm….
My friend JB over at Cocks and Asses Only  http://cocksandassesonly.blogspot.com has been sending me up the wall this week, and I think it’s a conspiracy to curcumvent my steadiness.  He’s been posting butts, beach sex, and fuck pix - all my very weaknesses.
Since we have to head back for the night I will get none of what he posted other than the closeness of my husband and pine for a time when we can - well, git nekkid and have some fun.  In the meantime enjoy today’s pic.  It’s something that I want to enjoy one day - just G and I.

KILL THE BITCH
Kill Her, kill her, killllllll her.  She serves no purpose for mankind.  Same with that Bachmann bitch and her husband.
Yes, Boys and Girls.  Let us pray.  Let us pray that the gayness that’s within our hearts be lifted from us and for God to restore us to the path of true righteousness.  In the name of Jay-sus.
And while we’re at it let’s call in the Priest and exorcise our demons.  Next we can wrap ourselves in blankets and rebirth ourselves whole again.  In the meantime we can all:
Ooooh Fatherrrrrr, oh yes, yes, fuck me Father for I have sinned.  Mmm, that’s it ohhh, harder, I’ve really, really sinned….oh yesssssss…….

“Straight” My Ass.
Ok boys and girls.  For those of you that have been following this Blog for the last year or so, you know that I’m basically a horn dog.  I exacerbate my husband all the time.  I’m either groping and fondling him or I’m ogling all the guy candy that I happen upon.  IF NOT doing that I’m thinking about sex all the time.  Hey, you know, your typical male.
There isn’t a lot of things I won’t (haven’t) explore(d), sexually, - BUT, but with enough beer in me, you can pretty well bet that whatever limits and exclusions I may have had will be completely gone.  (Just don’t remind me in the morning.)
I also have to admit that I can be completely naive at times when it comes to gay and being gay.  I only been out some nine years.  I am, though, curious enough and a fast learner.  I also have a list of fantasies that I would like to start working on.
Now G and I have had our share of 3-some’s in the past; guys we have felt comfortable at all levels to do that.  It’s a great time, especially if you make an evening of it.  G and I have gotten relatively right kinky on occasions.
G gets hit on all the time.  I don’t mind.  There have been a few guys that have not listened to G and have repeatedly harassed him for sexual favors (always “straight” guys that have had more than their share of ETOH - imagine that) and I have gotten into their face and told them to back off.  I don’t like doing that but NO means no.  I have no problem punching someone’s lights out.
Lately though, however, things have changed wherein we are both being hit on, as a couple, by sober “straight” guys, which is kewl, I think.  These are guys that know G and I and have somehow managed to climb over homophobia and have become just curious enough to explore.  This does not surprise me.  Ever see the amount of straight and married guys looking for sex with another guy on the DL- especially Craigslist?
A few posts back I related such a guy, Glen, and what we all wound up doing.  Have known another guy for a few months and he wants all of us now to have a night of merry mischief making.  Fuck YEAH!  Bring it on.  I’m game, especially if G is involved.  Git-R-Done!  (He’s also younger and quite a cutie.)
Departing from the Straight, for the moment, a single guy walked up to us and started a conversation late last week.  Eh, after a half hour or so the inevitable question was raised on each side and we’re all gay, except he’s into Drag.  Hmm.  (This is where my naivete comes REALLY into play. Gulp.  WT?)  Greg has done Drag before in the past, before he and I met - I have not.  Dunno, it’s just something I can’t see me doing.  I enjoy a good Drag show but beyond that, no thanks.  Just me.
I’ve always said that I am the most straightest gay guy you could know.  I am not a sissy nor am I limp-wristed, ‘n if you give me a 4-wheel drive pickup and point me to the nearest muddy field, I’m going to have one fucking hell of a good time.
So I’m thinking, hmmm, three in the last week - offers that is.  Where has all of this been?  Dayum.  Yet, I’m cautious.  These guys are single, rather than married (whose sexual health is pretty much certain) and…well…I won’t turn down any offer but it will be of the safe-sex variety for sure.
Will there be more offers?  Dunno.  Will the offers that have been extended be consumated?  Who knows.  Damn sure will let you guys know, one way or another.
Straight?  Yeah, sure buddy.  LOL

Redheads On Parade
I never knew how absolutely taken I am with redheads until I met G, the redheaded joy (and sometimes bain) of my life.  Now I’m completely smittened.
Since we spend a lot of time downtown at The Square, I never knew that there were quite a number of redheaded guys - corporate guys - walking around.  OMFG?  The greater percentage of are at least cute if not down right hot.
So, I’m thinking (well actually fantacizing) what it would be like to be in an orgy with all redheads.  Dicks, bushes, and asses all for me to, eh, ur, um, violate as I see fit.  Hmmmmmmm…..
