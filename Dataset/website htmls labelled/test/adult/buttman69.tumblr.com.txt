Emotional Food Choices
lifestylesolutions4u:
Many individuals suffer from the various eating problems, but among these eating issues there is one that really stands out and that is emotional eating. For most individuals emotional eating is the leading cause of irregular weight gain as you end up compensating for your anguish by constantly snacking. On occasion, emotional eating is fine, but indulging too often and the individual soon discovers distressing weight gain. It is all too simple to say ‘just cut back on your protein intake’ but usually this weight gain is from excess fats and sugar that is normally found in fast foods, and not from protein sources at all.
To evaluate whether you are prone to emotional eating, you will need to write down your state of mind prior to indulging in fast-food. Document whether you were feeling depressed, upset, or tired, etc. Just writing a few words about how you felt at the time of binging can make a world of difference when it comes to analysing your eating behaviours. Once you analyse your emotions in regards to your hunger levels and how often you participate in snacking, you may be able to find a pattern which you can use to steer your behaviour to a different direction. Maybe you discover that you eat more when you are depressed even if you do not feel that hungry at the time. Or perhaps you will find that you encourage happy days with food to make you feel even better.
The ultimate goal of documenting any eating disorder is to be able to track your dietary patterns to determine what needs to be changed for the purpose of getting healthy and losing weight. Numerous health articles will advise of the importance of focussing your attention on physical exercise to reduce the pounds, but if you are participating in unhealthy eating behaviours, then exercising will not be enough. Use your food diary to determine what triggers this unhealthy eating. While the focus of your food diary should be based on what you consume and how much you consume, you should also take the time to document your state of mind, how often you eat, and where you have your meals. While these important facts may seem worthless at first, they can provide you with a number of interesting observations about what you are required to change if you ever hope to stop this detrimental habitual behaviour and manage your weight.
