A Season of Fear
I met Adam in Buffalo, a city he came to at the age of ten as
a refugee from Iraq. I can’t tell you a lot about him. We only spoke for about
fifteen minutes, and I wasn’t looking for a pithy feel-good story.I was just looking for directions. He helped me, and then we
talked about sports and I asked him about his life, and he asked about mine. He
seemed like a normal twenty one year old attending community college.When I asked about coming to the US without any English, he smiled and said, “I
just had to work harder you know, to learn English. I wasn’t going to be embarrassed
and fail school.” When I pointed out his name didn’t sound very Iraqi, he looked puzzled, “I am
an American, and my name is Adam. What came before is gone. I am here now. This
is the country that took me in, that gave me a home.”Maybe he is more complicated than that. Maybe he has bad intentions. All of us
are complicated, and a lot of us have bad intentions.My mother’s ancestors seemingly all had bad intentions. They came from
Scotland, and if the records from the Isle of Mull are to be believed, they
were thieves and Scotland was happy to see them leave.My father came to the US from Germany escaping certain
death, because of his religion. My grandfather loved the US although the two
iron crosses he earned in WWI meant he once had very bad intentions. Maybe Adam wasn’t being honest with me. Maybe he, like some
suspect of the Syrians now fleeing a civil war, doesn’t want a better life and
won’t ever love the US. Maybe he has outsmarted the immigration procedure and
is harboring bad intentions. Maybe he is using the chaos and death in the Middle
East to come here and spread more chaos and death.I doubt it. It is a risk I am willing to take, on him and those now leaving
Syria. It is a risk we as a country have been taking for a long time. It is a
risk we have taken for pretty much everyone in this country.It is a bet that the things we claim about the US, you know
the freedom, safety and opportunity thing, is stronger than any bad intentions
lurking in a few angry people. It is a bet that that the give me your tired, poor, angry, ugly, blah blah
blah, isn’t just words on a statue, but something bigger: A believe that people
are intrinsically good, and that we are bigger than the fears and confusion of
the moment.That is a bet worth taking.

Power, consent, and representation
(Screen shot taken from Michael Kamber’s webpage)I was included in a Bronx
Documentary Center (BDC) show, Altered Images, on ethics in photography. The
reasons stated are many (you can view them below on this tumblr) but the gist was that for four
years I, a rich white man from Brooklyn, have been taking pictures of poor drug
addicts in Bronx (and sometimes helping them, both financially and personally),
raising issues of power, consent, and representation.I am, however, not alone. All photography is steeped in those
issues. Take the curator of the Bronx Documentary Center show, Michael Kamber, for example. He spent much of his career working for the New York Times as a conflict photographer. He photographed
wars in Africa, and the Iraqi war working out of their Baghdad bureau. The New York Times is one of largest and most influential media
companies in the U.S. It openly and aggressively (and some say fraudulently) supported
the U.S. invasion of Iraq. It is a company owned by a wealthy white male from
the U.S.  Although it does not
matter to me at all, the ownership is Jewish, something that certainly
matters too much of the local population in the Middle East and Africa.  That is a fairly large power difference
and one rife with the issue of representation that exists regardless of how
careful Mr. Kamber or the New York Times is.
The BDC has pointed out, in a negative way, that those who view my work are “largely
suburban and European supporters.” Ditto for the readers of the New York
Times, certainly relative to those in Africa and the Middle East.Mr. Kamber never monetarily helped his subjects although the
Baghdad office certainly hired drivers, guards, scouts, etc.  Still Mr. Kamber sells his pictures
online, including that of a Liberian child soldier (pictured above), a photo
dripping with issues of consent, representation and power. That is a difference
I have clearly stated that I am comfortable with. I would rather help my
subjects than make money from them.Mr. Kamber’s work, and mine, and any artist who deals with issues
of poverty, violence, addiction, or war, is going to face, and should face, serious
questions concerning the way they work. Some do it better than others. Teju
Cole expressed succinctly what I feel is the salient point for those artists (or
journalists).“Does your work on the
Other convey that conflict emerges from political processes, or does it ascribe
it to atavistic impulses?”The BDC used four pictures of mine, the only ones I have
involving nudity (out of over 1,000 photos from four years). They were
presented stripped of context, removed from the larger project they are part of,
removed from essays, and the words attached ignored.
Stripped of the words and the context, it is easy to view the nudity atavistically.
Viewed in context, they are attempts to show how our society and culture, our
political process, mostly driven by rich white men, but really all men, have stripped
many poor women of agency, leaving them to be viewed
as objects. The stark nudity in the four pictures were visceral exclamation
points to larger
essays on a political process. It is a process that most of us, very much including
the Bronx, is guilty of upholding.
Similarly, Mr. Kamber’s photos, given the context of full reporting, show how
soldiers and those in a war zone are often stripped of their agency and used and
abused by a political process, one that the New York Times and its readers are
partly responsible for. The BDC, by only addressing issues with work on the Other by
highlighting my photos, missed a wonderful opportunity to talk about the
broader issue of power, consent, and representation in photography. They missed
a chance to show how every photographer must grapple with these tough issues, and how most, even those with the best intentions, fail at some level.  I certainly hope they eventually get
there.———-
Many of the ideas in this essay are the product of a post, and the discussions following, on the very thoughtful blog, Duckrabbit

Response to Bronx Documentary Center
Thanks for the notification of a piece of my work being included in your Altered Images exhibition. While I would have appreciated more time to consider, I am nonetheless happy to grant permission of the inclusion and display of my work in this exhibition and am willing to supply my images in whatever format is most feasible on your short timeline (though fine art prints are preferred).
Note this is not because I agree with your assessment of my work, but rather because I find the dialog around the nature of formal documentary photography very interesting, considering that we now live in an era where to not document one’s life and share it with the public via social media is seen as the exception rather than the rule.
I think it’s deeply important to understand that at no point have any of the images I’ve taken been produced on commission by The Guardian or any news outlet that you would hold to the ethical standards of journalistic integrity you reference. My photographs of sex workers, addicts, and the homeless of Hunts Point, Bronx, started, continued, and remains a personal project driven by my own curiosity and fueled by carefully developed relationships with my subjects all of whom I’ve spoken to in depth so I can try to understand what they are going through. What I’ve learned is that largely they are caught in a cycle of poverty, violence, discrimination, and misunderstanding perpetuated by greater society.
My only hesitation towards permitting the display of my images in your exhibition is the clearly negative undertone of the context in which you’ve placed them. You have failed to account for how my subjects feel about the images I’ve taken of them. Their poses are very much their own, and I am insulted by your implication that I manipulate them into what you say are degrading positions. When desperation has driven a person to stand on a corner with her tits out in the hopes of sucking a dick for money – for whatever purpose that money is intended – I think you’d agree that her standards have been changed.
It might be hard to understand, but more often than not the women in my pictures are proud of what they are showing me.
This is something I have discussed extensively, and written about in my essay “Why I am showing a sex workers breasts.” I am curious how would you compare these intentions to, for instance, Philip-Lorca diCorcia’s Hustlers series?
I cannot speak of all the other works included in your show, but the ones discussed in public are all cases of a lack of honesty and transparency by the artist. They are attempts to deceive through misinformation or deception. I have always been clear and transparent about my intentions, methods, and lack of complete objectivity. I insert myself in the process and document my attempts to help my subjects. My lack of objectivity is intentional and integral to my work. I can do this because it is a personal project where my relationships to my subject is more important than getting paid for taking pictures.
Finally, your implication that those I work with are unable to understand their role and to give consent displays a fundamental, and demeaning, misunderstanding of addicts, and addiction. It falls into the common media narrative and trope that addicts are helpless, dumb, stupid, infantile, lazy, etc.
Four years working with street addicts has taught me nothing could be farther from the truth. Addicts are as smart as any group I have worked with. They are people with a nasty disease in a nasty situation.
The goal of my project is to remind people of that. Hopefully the Bronx Documentary Center will learn that from a display, however small and brief, of a section of my work.

OOOOH, I am not liked… By a museum.An email I received from the head of the Bronx Documentary Center. ChrisApologies for the late email, we are putting together a show on short notice and just finalizing the lineup. On Saturday we will open up our Altered Images exhibition, which examines posed, faked or manipulated documentary photography. A number of people had suggested we include your work of substance abusers and sex workers.  We have reviewed your work.  You qualify on a number of levels and will be included.You admit to paying your subjects, which violates one of the most closely held tenets of documentary photography. Paying to photograph any person, particularly one dependent upon drugs, and even driving them to buy drugs, as you say you have done, is a clear breach of ethics and standards.I see that you say claim, in interviews, an exemption from journalistic and documentary standards by saying you are not a journalist.  Yet you publish your photos in the Guardian, one of the world’s most prestigious media outlets.  Ethical guidelines apply.A key guideline of the National Press Photographers Assn reads: “Treat all subjects with respect and dignity. Give special consideration to vulnerable subjects.”Your photos of sex workers, some addicted to drugs, some with mental health issues and/or severely emotionally abused, exposing their breasts or bent naked over a bed, are a breach of this standard.  The fact that you also publish these photos on Flickr, to be gawked at by thousands, raises further ethical issues too numerous to address here. Briefly, people who are paid by you, under the influence of drugs or mentally impaired (and in many cases have little understanding of The Guardian or Flickr), clearly do not have the ability to give informed consent to their photos being used as you have done. We will include a caption under your photo outlining these ethical breaches.  If you so choose, you can send us up to two paragraphs in response and we will give it equal weight next to our caption.I’m ccing our lawyer, Don Dunn, in case you have any legal issues you choose to raise.For some context, here is a piece I wrote about one of the supporters of Center: Addicts are people too.Here is the series my series on addiction: Faces of Addiction

Another day
She was tiny, less than five feet tall and under a hundred pounds. She was also new. Nobody had ever seen her before. She was working the wrong corner, too close to the police station. Nobody was going to pick her up there. Not this early, not when the kids are still walking to school. She had to be new. She approached my car, “You got a smoke?” Her voice was also tiny, almost a whisper.“I came to Hunts Point this morning. I am from over the river. A regular told me to come here, that it is better, but I don’t know. I been out since four and I haven’t gotten anything, not even a smoke.”She looked around as she spoke, twisting and playing with her hair, biting her lip.“You sure you don’t want to party? Maybe you can spare fifty cents?”I offered to buy her McDonalds. She got in the car, “You not a cop are you? You sure? If you take out your dick or touch my boob, then I know you ain’t a cop.”
I explained she was just going to have to trust me. She smiled, looking me in the eyes for the first time “Ok. But only because I am hungry.”She cleaned up in the bathroom before ordering from the dollar menu and then cleaned away the ketchup stains left from someone else. “I don’t understand people who can eat at a dirty table.”She sat quietly, looking down, trying not to eat too quickly. After ten minutes she put her head down and cried. “I relapsed two years ago. That’s when I started doing the street work. Until then I didn’t do anything like that, no matter how bad. I hate what I am doing, every time I suck a dick I lose a little of myself. It is humiliating.”“I grew up in Brooklyn. My mother had me when she was 17. She died of AIDS. So did my father. I was passed around to relatives before they put me in the foster system. I started using drugs after my baby died, when I was 21.
My other two kids, I don’t know where they are. One is all grown up, 19.
I haven’t seen them since they were in diapers.”“Now I got no real home. I got a few places I can stay, but mostly I just sleep when I can. I have a friend, M. He is an old date, he lets me stay over at his place, but I have to have sex with him. He wants to be my pimp, but no one will ever pimp me.”I gave her twenty dollars for her time, for allowing me to photograph her. “Can you drive me over the river? My dealer is there.”On the ride over she called him, “Face. It is M. I need one dog two candies.”She waited for a police car to pass before getting out and disappearing into one of the projects, “It will be only five minutes.” Forty-five minutes later she returned frustrated. “This woman was there, her name is Sister, and she been trying to compromise my relationship with Face, tells him that I owe her money. So I only got two candies. Don’t worry, the police won’t find it. I got it stashed in my pussy. They don’t check there.”She wanted to smoke, but didn’t have a stem so she walked the ten blocks to M’s apartment, but he was gone.
She sat down on a stoop. “I can go to C’s, he is only a few blocks away. He got his own place because of his disability. He is nice, doesn’t grab me. Sometimes we do some stuff, but mostly he just likes to watch.”C lives in a ground floor studio, his building lost in the maze of projects. His knees stopped working fifteen years ago, from arthritis. He was sitting in his walker, bible on his lap, watching TV. She went into the bathroom to get the drugs. He handed her a pipe and she smoked on his bed, before asking, “You want to see?”She smoked the second hit before removing her pants. She quietly showed her body, only covering her stomach and chest, while he sat in his walker, his eyes switching between her and the TV, the bible now placed on a table.Before dressing she lifted her blouse, to show her stomach.
“I don’t like it so I usually keep it covered, but it is the only reminder I have of my kids.”More on addiction here: Faces of addiction

Black Belt
The black belt is string of very poor counties weaving through the center of Alabama and Mississippi, counties with some of the highest concentration of African-Americans. It is where cotton once grew, where slaves worked plantations.The veneer has changed, a new layer of franchises, frontage roads, and casinos, but the core is still not far from that plantation past. Labor is disposable and of little value: Jobs are scarce, hard, and dehumanizing. The poverty is open, exposed and made more painful by isolation: Trailers abutting county roads and odd clusters of low income ranch houses. The wealth is gated and garish, the result of a dual desire for attention and safety. A faux colonial mansion on a denuded hill.Threading throughout the landscape are churches. Church
after church after church.
Some are tinySome are notThey stand alone in a field of mudOr occupy the edges of larger townsThey are fashioned from anythingEven an old Pizza HutThey advertise in truncated messages: A biblical twitterSome preach less tolerance than othersThe spaces between the churches, between the old buildings, between the trailers are filled with flags.The message is clearIn a place so poor, with the highest percentage of
African-Americans, with a history of racial intolerance, with so many so disenfranchised, why are there so many
churches? When the physical world has given so little, has been so unjust, is
seen as uncaring, the spiritual world is all the more appealing

Christmas Eve
Three years ago, on Christmas Eve, I met Vanessa. She was standing on a street corner in Hunts Point selling herself to get more drugs. She was wearing flip-flops and a light jacket, despite it being below freezing. I couldn’t understand why someone would spend Christmas Eve this way. I didn’t know the details of heroin then, of how it turns the pupils into pinpoints and how it turns people numb to circumstances. I did see the pain.
Three years later I understand being numb to circumstance is a reason to use heroin. I understand holidays can be especially painful. Christmas is everywhere, a uniform and loud celebration of family, of remembering, and of having things. It is an awful time to have no family, to have bad memories, and to have nothing.
Christmas, as the nuns taught me, is also about hope that appears in the most modest of places, in the most unassuming manner, and in the most unexpected ways.
I have not seen much hope in Hunts Point. I have seen a lot of pain and met a lot of people seeking to be numb.
I don’t know where Vanessa is. She hasn’t been seen in the Bronx for over two years. That isn’t uncommon. Addiction devours people, smuggling them away to prisons, facilities, and cemeteries. I hope that she isn’t spending this Christmas Eve standing on a corner selling herself.
Others are though. In the Bronx, in Buffalo, in Los Angeles, in El Paso, in Memphis, in every city, on corners, under highway bridges, in empty houses, in empty lots, there are people who have nothing, who are filled with drugs trying to numb memories and forget what tomorrow is.

Scared
“I am tired of sleeping on trains, tired of hustling for a few dollars out here. I am scared, tired of Rikers, sick of running from police. Rehab, detox, all of them are the same, I don’t got anyone to go with, I don’t trust anyone there. I can’t do it without someone to do it with me.”
“I will go home, we do it after Christmas, drive to Oklahoma. My momma has a room for me. I got plenty of people, but they all doing things, got things, have families, and kids, and people who love them. I got nothing to offer them. What am I gonna be? A social security check that everyone wants. I got nothing else. Nothing. They all got people. I got nothing. I will be a drag on all of them.”
“I am scared. You hear? Scared.”
