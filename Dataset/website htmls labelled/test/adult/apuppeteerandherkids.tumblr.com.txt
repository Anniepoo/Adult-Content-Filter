Mechant walked over Jackie blushing. He was not much smaller than he use to he and also had a his hair cut. “Hey Jackie i was wondering. Would yo like to read with book with me?”
-
Mechant jumped up as well. His air waved around and he smiled at his sister. “Thank you Sarah.” He chuckled and turned to Jackie. “Do you want to read first?”  He asked silver eyes question her.
“Hmmmm…nah I think you should go first. Since, you know, you picked out the book and stuff.” Jackie shrugged with a smile. “I mean, if you want.”
He crossed his legs and took the book. From his pocket he brought out a pair of glasses and began to read. IT was an interesting book about a boy travel to discover what his life meant through space.

-s?”
He pointed down the hall. “Yeah in there. I don’t think she would mind.” He walked to the door and knocked gently.
His sister opened it smiling and let them him. “Hey Jackie and little bro.”
Cult growled. “I’m still older than you.”
Jacqueline walked into Sarah’s room saying in a loud voice “Hey Sarah! We were wonderingif you knew where there was a couch in the house so we can read this book on it.” Jackie handed the book to Sarah. “Wanna read it with us?”
Sarah thought for a moment. “Sorry love i have training with Fluff today but i do know where one is. If you’ll be kind enough to follow me.” Sarah walked out and the led the children to a couch. “You two can sit here and read.” She smiled.
Jackie grabbed Mechant’s hand and followed after Sarah before shouting out “Awesome!” And jumping onto the couch. She turned to Sarah “Thanks Sarah. We would’ve probably gotten lost on our own.”
Mechant jumped up as well. His air waved around and he smiled at his sister. “Thank you Sarah.” He chuckled and turned to Jackie. “Do you want to read first?”  He asked silver eyes question her.

Cult laughed nervously. “You’re just as likely to get lost with me right now. I kinda lost my way being smaller and stuff. I can’t rely on right and i don’t trust my since of memory.” He began walking trying to remember his way.
“Oh. Well maybe we can ask your sister, Sarah. I’m sure she’d know where a couch is and she might even want to join us in reading this book.” She looked around “Do you knoe where her room is?”

He thought for a moment. “We can go sit in my bed? Or huh the garden. Maybe a couch. I don’t know.” Huh there goes his decision making skills. Time to start making up those again. “Do any of those sound good?”
“Yes! To the couch!” Jackie through a hand in the air in declaration before asking “Can you lead the way though? We’ll probably get lost if I am the leader.” She giggled.
Cult laughed nervously. “You’re just as likely to get lost with me right now. I kinda lost my way being smaller and stuff. I can’t rely on right and i don’t trust my since of memory.” He began walking trying to remember his way.

Jackie smiled at Mechant before saying “Yeah sure. It beats being bored and alone. What’s the title of it?” Jackie took the book into her hands and look at the cover before opening it and flipping through it’s pages quickly.
“A journey through cursed space. It’s basically a teen novel i found. My sister said i should start reading these again.” He smiled. “Thank you. Where would you like to read?”
Jackie thought for a moment before saying “Considering I haven’t heard about this series yet, I think we should start reading from the beginning.” She stopped flipping through the pages and turned to the front of the book before saying “We should sit for this.”
He thought for a moment. “We can go sit in my bed? Or huh the garden. Maybe a couch. I don’t know.” Huh there goes his decision making skills. Time to start making up those again. “Do any of those sound good?”
