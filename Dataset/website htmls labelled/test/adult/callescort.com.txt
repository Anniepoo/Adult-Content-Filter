Call Emily - Diary of a Phone Sex Girl
I work as a phone sex operator in Atlanta as a way to pay for my school.
This is my story in this odd but lucrative business.

Goodbye my Lovers
I quit this job a few months ago, but out of curiosity I visited it again today.
I was surprised to see that so many people found my days as a phone sex girl interesting.
The fact now is that I'm getting laid a lot more now in real life and by a great guy.
I didn't hook up with any of my callers.
I met a great guy while on vacation in key west florida and moved in with him a few weeks later in his key west apartment.
He is a web designer and computer geek that just happens to have a great body and a wonderful sense of humor.
I'm happy and loving life.
Wish me luck. Em

NO FREE SEX FOR YOU !!!
I don't know what it is with callers wanting a "freebie" when they call?
I don't do this because I get off on it, not really.
I have to make a living and I'm sure not going to give away the fantasy for free.
Phone sex is not a need, it is only a want.
Wants can wait until you have the money.
For goodness sake - charge it on your credit card like everyone else!

I'm Back
I'm back now. Sorry for the delay. I do this sex phone job thing to pay my way through school. The issue now is that school is taking way too much of my time. I'm still managing to get in a few simulated blow jobs a week and ass fuckings, but I am so beat by the end of the night I just want to lay on my bed and veg out to Letterman. My time is being taken up by this super asshole professor that for whatever reason believes that his class is the most important thing to exist in the history of higher education. I was thinking that if I could get him on the phone maybe I could blackmail him for a good grade.For now I'm so tired that I am tempted to tell my next caller that I have a headache.

I'm Coming to Town - Let's Hook Up
It doesn't take long to get regulars. I lost my first set of regulars when I switched companies, but I have a new set already. Sometimes they get very attached.Recent call situation: “Hey, I’m coming to town and figured we could hook up.” I respond with, “yeah, maybe.”. You see, I don’t want him to stop calling because he drops big money on me a couple of times a week. The hope is that he just wants to do a phone fantasy about us meeting up in a hotel. Something with me showing up in a red plaid school girl skirt and a white button up top that is tied tight just below my breast. But I know that he is really wanting to hook up and marry me or something.He responds with, "Hell yeah. Let me get your address. I'll be there this weekend."This is where I start to break character. "Uh, I'm uh busy this weekend. I'm sorry... baby.""Ok, then I'll come next weekend. I got to see you and be with you. Don't you think we have something special?" He responds.Anyway, I try to wiggle my way out of this, but it doesn't go well when I finally have to tell him that there is no chance of us ever meeting in real life."YOU FUCKING BITCH!! YOU ARE SO FUCKING LUCKY I CAN'T FIND YOU. YOU FUCKING WHORE!!!! I'LL KILL YOU YOU YOU FUCKING WHORE!!!"Now, it becomes clear why he doesn't have a real girlfriend and has to call me twice a week.The reallly fucked up part is he called back later and apologized.

Auditory
Guys get turned on by sound and much as site.
At least that is what I have come to believe.
They love to hear me make sucking sounds and the sound of slapping.
I know they say that men are all about site, but I have learned that sound works pretty well too.
When I finally get laid again I am going to bring in my new skills and send that rocket to the moon.
Speaking of getting laid I really need to.
I have been rubbing myself a lot recently and using my little bunny a good bit too.
It is so mad to do this without an outlet.

Did I Just Say that Outloud?
I talk dirty, real dirty, several hours a night.
I am a huge slut on the phone.
I talk to young guys, old guys, couples, and the occasional woman.
I let them do my in back, finish on my face, lick me, and whatever else their fantasy wants.
I am a phone slut, and that is ok.
It is only fantasy and in real life I can't remember the last time I was laid and I have never done much of anything that I talk about to clients on the phone.
It is pretend.
The problem is that I talk so nasty so much that I am getting to a point where I am having to catch myself from doing it in public or with friends.
I was out with some friends the other night and and had to catch myself several times.
This was after a few drinks of course, but still. Update on working from home:
It is great working from home.
There is no crazy drive to work and I can actually wear anything I want.
I went to VS the other day and bought some sexy stuff to wear while I talk on the phone.
I think it really makes me sound sexier since I feel sexy.
I also have my little rabbit with me to turn on when a client wants that.
I have not actually used it while talking to a client, but I will soon.

Working From Home
I'm finally set up to work from home.
I login to an account on my computer when I want to work, and then I wait for calls to be routed to my home phone.
It is a pretty sweet deal.
I didn't even give a notice to Dan - not that he deserved it.
Last night I started taking calls.
I'm not sure what ads they are using to drive calls to me, but I think they must have something to do with young girls that want to have sex with older guys.
Most of my calls last night were guys that were over fifty (how do I know this? Because they kept telling me) that wanted to talk dirty.
I will give the older guys one thing.
They do know what they want.
When I talk to younger guys that have probably never been laid they are quiet and I have to lead the conversation.
That is not the case with the older guys.
They call and in less than a minute I'm on my knees blowing them (not really, but you know what I mean).
