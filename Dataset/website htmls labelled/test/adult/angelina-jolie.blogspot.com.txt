Angelina Jolie - blog dedicated to this amazing woman.
Sunday, February 08, 2004
O, I forgot one thing, a blog on a celeb would not be complete without some bio info so here it is:
Angelina Jolie was born in Los Angeles, California, June 4, 1975. This impressive, accomplished star actress is 5' 7" with a majestic body. Angelina Jolie is the daughter of Academy Award winner Jon Voight and French actress Marcheline Bertrand, who divorced when she was very young. Since becoming an actress, she uses her middle name, Jolie, as her last name. She uses her middle name because she wanted to become famous on her own merit.
Angelina lived in Palisades, New York, with her mother and brother James until she was ten, when they relocated to Los Angeles. At sixteen, Angelina moved across the street from her mother and immersed herself in theatre. She trained and performed at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, and studied under Jan Tarrant in New York, and Silvana Gallardo in L.A..
Angelina worked as a professional model in London, New York and Los Angeles. She has also appeared in music videos for artists such as Meat Loaf. Angelina gave up acting and moved to New York City, where she registered at NYU's film school. Acting however, was in her blood, and she returned to Hollywood just a year later.
Angelina made a huge impact on fans and critics with her compelling performance in "Girl, Interrupted", which went on to nab her an Oscar. As if her fan base wasn't large enough, Angelina's popularity skyrocketed when she donned shorts, guns and a ponytail to play Lara Croft in "Tomb Raider", based on the mega-popular PlayStation game of the same title.
While a part of the Met Theater in Los Angeles, Angelina worked alongside Holly Hunter, Ed Harris and Amy Madigan. Playing a hybrid creature, she landed her commercial picture debut in the 1993 "Cyborg II: Glass Shadows". She received some critical attention for her role in "Hackers" (1993), and also received the attention of the film's star, Jonny Lee Miller. Romance blossomed and the two married in March1996, only to divorce in February 1999. Other film credits include "Without Evidence", "Mojave Moon", "Love Is All There Is", her Globe-winning roles in "George Wallace and Gia", and "Pushing Tin", which co-stars John Cusack. Angelina married Billy Bob Thornton on May 5th, 2000.
Angelina collects daggers, has the Japanese symbol for death tattooed on her right shoulder and stays in shape by lifting weights, playing basketball and sky-diving. Angelina has seven tattoos on her body. "I dropped my pants in a tattoo parlor in Amsterdam," recounts Jolie. "I woke up in a waterbed with this funky-looking dragon with a blue tongue on my hip." One tattoo in particular, is the Japanese word for Death. "It's a reminder that we could die tomorrow, so live today. It was a positive reminder to be free."

Ok, before we move too far along I'm sure some of you came here looking for naughty pics of celebrities and stuff.
So let's get that out of the way.
Here's a link to one I found that has a nice front page design and looks pretty interesting.
Anyways, be WARNED you must be 21 years of age to view this type of material.
I've registered this blog with a lot of Internet filttering services so you can avoid this type of stuff if you don't like it.
I feel it a newsworthy link pertaining to celebrities as it shows our obsession with it, enough so that someone felt the need to make a nude celeb site!
OI VEY like we need anymore nudity on the internet!

Angelina Jolie is an amazing woman.
This blog is dedicated to reporting on her and news about her.
At first I thought she was just a hottie with big lips and a big ____ that married some old freaky guy.
But after watching an interview with her I was amazed at the depth of her personality and that she appeared to be such a Genuinely nice person.
Someone that you'd actually enjoy hanging out with and having a few drinks...which I find to be quite the opposite with most Hollywood people as they appear to come off as pretentious and stuck on themselves, which of course appears to be a hazzard of the trade ;)
Anyways, stick around this blog will be fun for all.
