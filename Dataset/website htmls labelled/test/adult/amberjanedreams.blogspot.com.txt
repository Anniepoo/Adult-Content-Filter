Saved by the Jews
It's the end of the world.
Anarchy has ensued, and no governing factions are in operation any longer.
Everyone who has money, or means, has left this busy city that I am in, and the streets are now crawling with the scum that are left.
Drug dealers, lunatics, addicts, and huge, agressive men that have stayed to do some serious damage to anyone around.
It's chaos outside, people are beating each other up, looting stores.
I try to grab a bunch of stuff out of a store to trade with people down the line, but I don't have a bag, and keep dropping things on the street.
The wind is terrifying, whipping newspapers and garbage into the air.
I have run down an alley with Ja. and crammed ourselves through an impossibly small trap door/grate type opening in a wall to crawl down into the basement of a building for shelter.
There is dark red, stained carpet on the ground, and the room is littered with crumpled up paper and old clothes.
Everyone down there is Jewish, and I realize that we are in a safe room of some kind just for Jewish people.
I am thankful that I no longer have blonde hair for some reason, and feel guilty for thinking about stereotypes, or assuming that they would turn on me if I was aryan.
We can hear screams and crazy noises from the street even from our hideout.
For some reason, I decide to leave.
I get cornered by these two men against a wall, and they taunt me, shoving me and leering into my face.
I manage to escape, and run back down the alley that I came up from.
I get back in the safe room.
It's a crazy, disjointed dream.
At one point, I am giving two men handjobs in this bathtub - they've threatened to kill me, and it's all I can think of to keep them occupied, and make them somehow feel SOMETHING for me so that they don't crush me with their huge fists.
I am crying, but still trying to maintain a happy face, like I want to be there.
At another point, I am in a van with Am. and Al.
We want to go and hide out in this library, but for some reason, won't be allowed in if Al. is with us.
Am is getting mad at him for not having the necessary skills.
We're driving down South Fraser.

Making out in the movietheatre
I am at the movies with Drew, an old friend who recently came to visit me (in real life) after 13 years of not seeing him.
He's undoubtably good-looking, and in the dream, the air is literally humming with crazed sexual tension.
We're sitting side by side in the dark, and sooner than later, he leans over and we start kissing like crazy.
He climbs over on top of me, and we are seriously making out.
Sh. is sitting in front of me with his mother.
He points to my engagement ring, shakes his head, and asks what exactly I think that I'm doing.
I snarkily say, "And who are YOU to be imposing any kind of moral judgement on me?"
He annoyingly laughs, and saunters off.
I wake up with the taste of his tongue in my mouth, horny as hell.

Baby Hedgehogs
Some construction/renovation on my house/neighbourhood is goin' on, and it's night time.
Amidst the rubble, I see a weird little nest, and some pink squirmy animals crawling around.
One comes towards me, but seems nervous.
I look, and see that it's a nest of pink baby hedgehods, with brand new quills.
I am trying to find someone to get them moved, but am worried that if anyone touches them, that the mom will have nothing to do with them anymore.
They're crawling all around, and I'm so scared that someone is going to step on them, or hurt them inadvertantly.

Belly Faces
I am in a huge discount store.
It's kinda like Sears, but different... more like Walmart... budget.
I am checking out some stuff, and see Julie, a friend I haven't seen in years, and wasn't on good terms with when we last saw each other.
She is very pregnant, and I can't help but look at her belly.
She pulls up her shirt, and lo and behold, her baby's face is protruding from the top of her stomach... not only that, but it's eyes are open, and you can see them. There's a face coming out of the top of her stomach, big blue eyes open & blinking at me.
It's the strangest thing, and I wonder if this is some new step in evolution.
We talk for a little while, and it's extremely awkward.
I take an elevator down to the first floor, an entire wall is missing, and it's kinda scary, trying not to fall off the edge.Later, I break into her house, and read her diary about our meeting.
She has a lot of wrought iron furniture, and her place is small with bad brown carpet.
There is a lot of white out in the book, and she says that she is worried that her butt was "too comfy looking"
Not sure what that means.And odd dream overall.

Man in the Oven
I'm in a kitchen in an apartment, presumably mine.
The lino is dingy, as are the walls, but the appliances are bright, shiny and new looking.
I have a man in my oven - I'm not sure why he's there, but I do know that nobody is supposed to know that he's there.
It's an uncomfortable fit for him - his limbs are all at odd angles, and his head looks like it might break off his body.
I try to close the oven door, and it just won't happen, I push against it, and finally, something gives so that it will close.
He makes some noise, and I worry, someone is going to find out that he's in there.
Someone else is with me - they're the one who put him in there in the first place.
He's got a knife, and opens the oven door, telling the man inside that he'd better be quiet... I say, "Don't you think you should just do it?
Are you going to slit his throat?"
I am horrified, but am so worried about us getting caught that I just want him to get it over with.Now, I'm in a huge, empty room.
Sh is there, sitting on the floor, and a bunch of other people are coming over.
I'm so upset, wanting them to leave, as the man in the oven has been in there for a couple of weeks, and I need to keep it a secret.
Now, the oven is outside, on a rooftop, in the very corner, and I'm sitting near it.
I'm trying to get everyone to go home, but more people just keep coming out onto the roof.
Someone is walking their dog near it, and I'm so scared, the dog is sniffing around, and looks like it knows what's up.
I know that the body is all decomposing, and that I need to get rid of it.
I'm not responsible for the death, but I do know that this person IS in my oven, has been for quite a long time, and the fact that I haven't called it in to anyone makes me look pretty damned guilty.
I think about ways to get rid of his body - cutting off a limb, and then flushing little bits of flesh down the toilet one piece at a time... I worry about a piece getting stuck, and meat piling up behind it, imagine it rotting in the sewer pipes, and people finding out about it.
He's too big for me to move by myself, and I feel nauseous at the thought of removing bits at a time.
I think about leaving, just walking away, but it's my rooftop, and someone is bound to peek in that oven at some point.A woman with red hair approaches me.
She's a cop, and it makes me extremely nervous to have her standing anywhere near the oven.
She goes to stand with her partner, and they ask me if we can take a little walk.
What am I going to do?
I start walking away from the oven, and look over my shoulder, giving it a too long glance before I realize that they're probably watching me.
They look back at the oven, and now, there's more than one person walking their dogs, and all the dogs are starting to sniff at the appliance.
Other dogs on the rooftops of other buildings are starting to bay & bark, getting all worked up at the smell of the man in the oven.
I'm so scared.
There's a close up of a german shepherd standing up against a wall, his head peeking over the top, sniffing and sniffing with his nose.I wake up.
What the fuck kind of dream IS that?

Tour Bussin' 'Rents
Driving through a field in a big tour bus type camper.
I'm with my parents, and we're driving through a field - we have an hour to get to our flight, so we're a little rushed.
I have two towels with me.
One is dingy white, the other is royal blue with some crazy pattern on it.
I'm clutching them to me, and they're all damp.
There's this weird crack in the wall in the bus that's big enough for me to see the ground.
My towels keep almost falling through it, and I keep trying to fit them through the crack so they'll hang & dry.
They both fall through, and I'm all upset, asking everyone to stop the bus.
My dad & I get out to go & get the towels, both of which have been run over by the bus.
We're in a big meadow, and the grass is all dewey, fog is coating everything, and there's a ramshackle fence cutting through it with saggy wire. I'm in someone's house.
It's very 70's neglected, with green shag rug in the basement, and wood panels everywhere.
Her mom is getting drunk, very drunk - she's supposed to be sober, a recovering alcoholic, but she's got these big biker type guys down there with her, and she's slamming back hard liquor.
She's partying it up, dancing on top of the coffee table, shaking her ass, which is encased in too light leopard print pants.
She has big hair, big crunchy smoker eighties-mom hair.
She keeps running at us screaming, and when we get scared, she just laughs & laughs.
She starts breaking shit, and we wonder if we should call the cops or not.

Fish Tanks and Harleys
I'm in a huge parking lot, riding a ramshackle old bicycle.
I'm trying to get to this massive thrift store on the other side of the lot.
This very skinny, kind of sexy rough looking girl is driving a Harley.
It' s like, a chopper, or something, all drawn out & chrome & black.
Her jacket has tassles, and she looks so tough.
It makes me want a motorcycle somethin' fierce, and I frantically ride my very uncool bike to keep up with her.
She parks, and we both head into the thrift store.
Her legs are so thin, and I idly think about taking up drugs to get skinny again, but decide that glamour cannot come from anything so vile.
I nose my way in with my bike.
My mission is to get a fish tank. I have been in this store before - it has all kinds of weird fish that you can buy... but there's also a thrift store making an appearance in this dream.
It's rather disconcerting when places that you have been in your dreams months ago are still there - it fucks with your idea of reality, big time.
The water is murky, and they have a huge variety of large goldfish.
I realize that I'm looking in the new arrivals section of the thrift store after thinking how disorganized everything is.
I find a book with my mum's nice writing inside of it, and realize that some of this stuff is my parents' cast offs... this particular book is a Jewish cookbook, lowfat, light, something like that.
It's falling apart a little bit, and has that old seventies look to it, hand drawn details on the front cover.
I pick up a tea pot that is kind of nice, but remind myself that I'm looking for a fishtank.
I peek around the corner to see if maybe there's a section in the thrift store that is dedicated to fishtanks.
There are beds everywhere, including this ridiculous one that has wide sides on the outside of that mattress.
It's got kind of a staircase effect to the sides, so that you can rest a drink, or a lamp next to you on the bed, but at the bottom of the bed, the sides are low so you can get in and out easily.
It kind of looks like a massive armchair - it's dark brown, and although it's very tacky, I can see that it would be great with a little adjusting to the style and the colour.
I realize that I've forgotten my purse around the corner, so I go back to get it.
