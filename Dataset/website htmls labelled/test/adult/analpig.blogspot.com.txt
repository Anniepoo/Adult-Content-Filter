Plugable® Power 2015 3-Port 36W Review
Are you looking for Plugable® Power 2015 3-Port 36W USB Fast Smart Charger Car and Truck Cup Holder for Apple iPhone and iPad, Samsung Galaxy, Google Nexus, Motorola Droid, HTC One, Sony Xperia, Nokia Lumina, Dell Venue, and more. (AC Wall Outlet Powered)?Plugable® Power 2015 3-Port 36W FeaturesThe Plugable Power Cup USB smart charger was designed to fit nearly any car or truck's drink cup holder and be powered off of any standard 12V automotive accessory socket (cigarette lighter). Charges up to 3 devices at the same time, perfect for vehicles that don't have a built in USB charger or when the whole family needs to charge on a road trip!The smart charging cup can provide a powerful 36 watts of power across its 3 USB ports for rapid charging of your mobile devices. It also has a small storage compartment for tucking in loose charging cables or holding small cell phones (like an iPhone 4), eye glasses, pens/pencils, loose coins, E-Cigarettes, etc. 5FT power cable included.Charges almost all Apple, Android, and Windows Mobile devices including, but not limited to the iPad Mini/2/3, iPad Air/2, iPad Retina, Apple iPhone 6/6 Plus/5s/5c/5/4s (and older), all 30pin iPods and Touch, Samsung Galaxy S/Note/Tab, Google Nexus 4/5/6/7/9/10, Moto G/X/Droid/Turbo, HTC One M8/M9, Sony Xperia Z2/Z3, Amazon Kindle Fire/HD/HDX, Nokia Lumina, Nook, Blackberry, Sony PSP/Vita, Nintendo DS/3DS, and more.Small Windows tablets such as the Dell Venue 8 Pro, Lenovo Miix 2 8", HP Stream 7, Nextbook 8, Toshiba Encore Mini, Toshiba Encore 8, Acer Iconia W4, ASUS Transformer T100TA, ASUS VivoTab 8, and more are supported.Three dedicated smart charging ports that automatically select the best charging mechanism for the device (Apple 1A, 2.1A, 2.4A, Samsung 2.4A, Android, BC 1.2). Can supply up to 36W (7.2A) total among all 3 ports for rapid device charging.Plugable® Power 2015 3-Port 36W DescriptionUSB has become more than a way of connecting devices to a computer with plug-and-play ease and also performance. It has also become this method of choice to power and also charge a huge range of portable power supply-powered devices like cell phones, tablets, USB power supply packs, handheld game consoles, e-readers, e-cigarettes, cameras, smart watches, fitness trackers, bicycle lights, and also many more.Unfortunately, USB charging is not well standardized and also in this car on this go most people require to get an expensive dedicated vehicle charger for each of their mobile devices. Often just one device could be charged at a time due to not enough 12V accessory sockets and also keeping separate chargers for each device could clutter up this car interior. The USB-C3C could help solve these frustrations by offering three dedicated USB smart charging ports in one compact drinking cup sized package to tuck away cleanly and also securely in this car cup holder.3 Smart Charging PortsThree 2.4A smart charging ports which will be capable of automatically selecting this best charging method for this device attached for several additional charger types, such as USB-IF Battery Charging Standard (BC 1.2), and also special signals for Apple 1A, 2.1A, 2.4A and also Samsung 2.4A chargers. Up to 36W (7.2A) total power to share between all 3 ports. Enough power to charge three iPads at this same time.Using the smart charging ports, we've seen which devices like this Google Nexus 7 tablet and also could charge at nearly double this universal charging port speed. For detailed charging information on known compatible devices, see our USB-C3C product page on plugable.com
