Late/Partial Payments: If your payment comes back as non-sufficient funds then we are allowed to only charge a $15 fee by the applicable laws of the State of California.
Non-payment:  We will take legal action if there is no intent to pay.  Additional fees such as court fees and other related court costs will be applied.
