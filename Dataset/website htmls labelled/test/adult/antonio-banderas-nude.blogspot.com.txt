Antonio brings his favourite girls to Malaga
Antonio brings his favourite girls to Malaga: "Movie heart-throb Antonio Banderas has been treating his family to a very Spanish holiday. The hunky actor took his wife Melanie Griffith and their little girl Stella to his home town of Malaga just as the annual Holy Week celebrations got underway.
The A-list family were pictured as they watched the traditional Palm Sunday processions pass below their window. And Antonio, who was snapped pointing out details of the display to his eight-year-old daughter, seemed to be relishing the opportunity to share a little of his heritage with his two favourite girls.
Every spring towns and cities throughout Spain explode in vibrant celebration as the country marks Easter Week. Ornately decorated floats bearing statues of the Virgin Mary or Jesus are carried through the streets while sombre religious songs are sung by local performers. "

Mexican actor avoids Oscars due to Banderas' song
Mexican actor avoids Oscars due to Banderas' song: "Mexican actor Gael Garcia Bernal refused to attend the 77th Academy Awards - because Antonio Banderas replaced singer Jorge Drexler to perform at the ceremony.
The 'Motorcycle Diaries' star was horrified when he learned that Uruguay's Drexler wouldn't be able to perform his own 'Al Otro Lado Del Rio' on the show 'for commercial reasons', and was replaced by Banderas and Carlos Santana, reported the Internet Media Database.
Bernal, who was thrilled when Drexler scooped an Oscar for the song and made a point of singing some of the song instead of making a speech, said: 'At the time his song is being honoured, all a sudden, that's the moment he does not exist?
'It was impossible for me to be there as part of the film. I didn't want to pretend the song was not part of it; that would have been like an act of murder in the family.' "

'Shrek's' Puss in Boots Gets Second Life, with Antonio Banderas
Zap2it.com MOVIES | MOVIE NEWS | STORY: "He's orange, feline, CG-animated and returning in 2008.
No, it's not a sequel to the 'Garfield' movie, but 'Puss in Boots,' a 'Shrek 2' spin-off starring the swashbuckling scene-stealer himself.
The DreamWorks project has hired 'American Pie 2' scribe David H. Steinberg to pen the screenplay about the other 'annoying talking animal' that elicited more laughs than the leading ogres in 'Shrek 2,' report news sources.
Antonio Banderas will once again lend his voice to the popular character for the project, which may be released straight to DVD or theatrically.
Before coughing up hairballs, Banderas will first star in the action sequel 'Legend of Zorro' this November. He's also attached to star in 'Take the Lead,' about a real-life pro dancer who creates a new dance style combining ballroom and hip-hop dancing styles."
