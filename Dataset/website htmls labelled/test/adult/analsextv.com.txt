The Dangers and Long Term Effects of Anal Sex
There’s a common saying: “If something makes you happy it’s either immoral, illegal or gets you fat”. In this case, let me add - “has a certain health risk” - to the list.
Anal sex is a very pleasurable experience for both partners if they know what they’re doing. It also comes with a set of possible health hazards. Some are more likely to happen, while others are very unlikely. I will try to separate the most common myths from reality. Also, I’ll tell you about some real risks anal sex carries if practiced without caution. Follow these simple guidelines and you should be safe to enjoy years of anal with your partner.
Many couples practicing anal sex wonder if it has long term effects.
Contrary to popular belief anal sex does not ‘loosen up’ your anus, or produce problems with bowel movement control. Of course, it depends what you mean by anal sex; I don’t guarantee that fisting, footing, or object insertions are safe but penis penetration with proper lubrication, protection and care can be as safe as vaginal sex.
If you follow these 6 simple rules, you should have nothing to worry about:
Be gentle and move slowly at first
Use plenty of lube.
Use a condom.
Avoid spermicides, they can cause skin irritation and are useless as you can’t get pregnant from anal sex.
Never go “ass to pussy”, “ass to mouth” or anywhere else without changing the condom and/or washing your penis.
Stop immediately if there is severe pain or blood.
Why you should lube up and go gently
Your woman’s anus has no natural lubricants. Excess friction caused by forceful anal sex or lack of lubrication can lead to mechanical injuries. Tissue inside the rectum is fragile and when injured, it enables pathogens to enter the body. That’s why you need to stop if your girl complains feels intense pain; it is a definite sign that you’re doing something wrong. Don’t copy what you see in ‘anal destruction’ porn.
Quick tip: Don’t confuse INTENSE PAIN with feeling ‘a bit uncomfortable’. The latter is normal for couples just getting into anal. Just like it probably hurt your girl ‘a bit’ when she popped her cherry, it’s probably going to be similar to her anal cherry.
Why you should use protection
Anal sex is the easiest way to transmit STDs. The main function of the rectum is to absorb fluids that were not absorbed by the digestive tract. Combine that with possible micro tears caused by friction from unprotected anal and you get a heaven for STD transmission.
If you trust and know your partner very well, than it MIGHT be ok to do go without condom assuming you are both 100% healthy (STD wise) and clean (just took a bath). In case you’ve just met and started dating, or you are unsure about his/her sexual past – using a condom is mandatory.
STDs that can be transmitted during anal sex are the same as in normal sex, but carry a higher infection risk. The most common ones are:
Chlamydia
E. coli
Gonorrhea
Hepatitis A, B and C
Herpes
HIV
HPV
Mycoplasma Genitalium
Pubic lice
Syphilis
Ureaplasma Urealyticum
If you or your partner think or feel that you might have any of these, please go to your doctor, as you probably have bigger problems than anal sex. None of these are fun to have and can be a real pain to get rid of. Some diseases like HIV or Hepatitis can lead to death so take the condom warning seriously.
Other than STDs, the anal cavity is filled with bacteria that naturally live inside of it. Insert your penis without protection and you face a risk of these bacteria spreading to your urinary tract and causing an UTI (urinary tract infection).
Why you should not practice ‘ass to mouth’
Leave porn stunts to porn stars in movies. The amount of disinfection, STD tests, douching and numbing an average porn star’s ass goes through before attempting ‘anal destruction’, ‘ass to pussy’, or ‘ass to mouth’ is enough to take all the fun and sexyness out of it for your girlfriend.
Quick tip: If you really want to try ass to mouth, here’s the safe way to do it: have anal with a condom, then take off the condom and stick your penis wherever you want, 100% risk free.
Why you should not worry about anal cancer
Anal sex itself has not been proven to increase the risk of any sort of colorectal (anal) cancer.
On the other hand some forms of human papillomavirus (HPV) have shown to increase the risk of cancer. Again, beware of STDs and get regular checkups.
Why you should not worry about the long term effects of anal sex
If something hurts, stop or change the way you’re doing it. The only way that anal can cause a long term effect on bowel movements is if you repeat the same injury over and over, or insert an object that’s too big in your/your partner’s anus. Avoid doing those and your girl will be ok long term.
Also, you might find that there are numerous pain numbing creams and anesthetics specifically designed for anal sex. I would avoid using them. Pain is there for a good reason - to signal to your (your girl’s body) that something’s wrong.
To sum up, cancer and losing control over bowel movement due to practicing anal are very uncommon. STD-s, infections and minor injuries aren’t, so watch out for those. Just follow the simple steps I covered: be gentle, lube up, use protection and stop if it hurts – and you and your girl won’t have anything to worry about.

Top 9 Anal Sex Positions to Try With Your Girlfriend
You are probably familiar with the most common sex positions. Watching porn, combined with a bit of real world experimenting should be enough to get the hang of almost any position.
When it comes to anal sex though, it’s not that simple. The positions used for anal that you see in porn movies usually don’t work as well in real life. Porn stars who ‘take it up the ass hard’ undergo anal douching with antibacterial soap, get themselves anaesthetized and apply loads of lubricants before the director even yells “ACTION!” Also, porn stars usually have much more experience with sex (anal or vaginal) than your average couple.
Anal is typically the riskiest form of sex. The receiver has a high probability of contracting an STD or getting injured. This is mostly due to lack of natural lubrication. Other than that, the ass wasn’t really designed by nature for sex. It’s us guys who love sticking stuff inside it.
No worries. I’ll give you 3 positions for total beginners which you can enjoy without worrying about hurting your girl. Later on, as both of you get more comfortable with anal sex, you can try out the more advanced methods.
Beginner Level
1. Missionary
Lie on top of your woman and face her directly. Missionary is the best position for beginners because it allows the woman to fully relax (which is very important for having anal sex). You’ll be facing her directly and will be able to tell if she’s uncomfortable at any point by her facial expressions. This will make initial penetration much easier and that first experience much more pleasurable.
Quick tip: Have her lie on her back with a pillow under her pelvis, with her legs facing slightly upwards. Enter at an angle that is most comfortable for both of you. The pillow is there for easier access. If it’s your first time having anal sex, be sure to read this guide on how to prepare your girl for anal before you proceed.
2. Knees on Chest
This is a variation of the missionary position. Lie down on a bed or on the floor. Any comfortable flat surface will do. Have your woman raise her legs up over your shoulders and hold onto your arms. Keep your hands on the surface for support and let her guide your penis into position.  Again, a pillow below her pelvis can help.
Quick tip: This position, like Missionary, will help your girl relax her muscles and it will provide much more skin to skin contact between you and her - making anal even more pleasurable. Try this position if you want a more intimate, romantic experience.
3. Sideways
Anal with the man on top and woman lying on her side is another easy one for beginners. The skewed point of entry will create a totally different sensation than previous positions. It’s also great for men because access from the side will be much easier if you don’t happen to be gifted with a 7’’+ member. The position is quite simple; have your girl lie on her side while you approach her from the rear.
Quick tip: Use more lube than usual and have her stick her legs together. The tightness of her backdoor and resulting friction will overwhelm your senses.
Medium Level
Once you’ve mastered the beginner positions, you can try medium and then expert level. The following are aimed at maximizing yours and your partner’s pleasure, while still not being too physically demanding to try for anal newbies. I’ll put them in order from easiest to hardest.
4. Anal Love Seat
Lie down on your back and tell her to get on top of you. Have your woman lean forward as much as she can, facing your feet. Your legs should surround hers. The fact that she’s leaning forward will ensure a good penetration angle and you’ll get an excellent view of your target - your girl’s sexy ass.
The thing that turns guys on the most with Anal Love Seat is definitely the clear view of your woman’s butt. Make it even better for her by massaging her ass, hips and lower body while she’s ‘working it’.
Quick tip: Penetrate her slowly (at first) and let her control the pace of sex. Resist the temptation to take things into your own hands and pound her to death. If you’re worried about cumming prematurely, Anal Love Seat is the right choice, as guys tend to last a bit longer with this position.
Next, I’ll give you the perfect position for an anal quickie.
5. Flying Doggy-Style
It’s similar to standard doggy style, but with a fun twist. Get behind your girl and have her on all fours, with her ass up and face flat on the bed. What separates regular and flying doggy-style is the fact that you’re standing for the flying version. Spread her cheeks, lube up generously and enter slowly. Penetrate your girl downwards for the best experience.
Quick tip: I guarantee that you’ll love this position. It’s great if you want to cum quick as the intense sensation and total control will drive you crazy with lust. Just make sure your girl isn’t left unsatisfied by your swiftness.
6. Anal Joyride
If you’re feeling lazy, let her have the Anal Joyride. Just lean back with your arms, the wall, or a pillow supporting you and tell her to climb on top of you. She will be in total control. All you need to do is help her guide your soldier inside. Once she starts riding, she’ll never want to stop.
Quick tip:  You might think that Joyride would be great for beginners because the woman can control the depth and speed of the penetration. That’s true but she’s also very likely to involuntarily tense up and tighten her anus making penetration harder. If she tenses up, don’t panic or try to force it inside her. Stop for a minute, finger and massage her ass to get her to relax, and then resume slowly.
Expert Level
By the time you get to expert level, you should be sure that you both love anal sex and have had it at least 10 times. Now you’re ready to try the expert positions. Caution though, a clumsy move can cause your partner considerable pain.
7. Cocoon
Cocoon allows the deepest penetration of all positions. Have your woman sit on the edge of the bed, kitchen counter or table, whatever you prefer. Stand up while facing her and help her prop her legs up on your shoulders, one leg at a time. Now enter her and hold her around the lower back area.
Quick tip: She needs to be a bit flexible for this position. If you and your girlfriend aren’t sure that she’ll be able to cocoon herself up - maybe it’s time to think about signing up for a yoga class.
8. Doggy-Style
This is probably the first thing that comes to mind when you think of anal sex. Man kneeling behind and the woman on all fours. It’s the most common position among people who practice anal, but not necessarily the most comfortable. She might not be able to relax totally and your angle of penetration will typically be slightly upwards, possibly making sex difficult.
Quick tip: If she seems uncomfortable, switch to flying doggy style.
9. Wheelbarrow - The Mount Everest of Anal Sex Positions
Approach her from behind while both of you are standing facing a bed or a chair. Have her bend over and rest her arms on it for support. Lift one of her legs up and hold it next to your hip to expose her behind. Enter and enjoy!
Quick tip: This is can be a physically demanding position. If both of you have the physical strength, stamina and experience to enjoy this position, congratulations, you’ve earned the title of Anal Sex Pros.
I’m looking to improve this list. Comment below if you’ve got any more interesting positions to recommend to others. I’d love to hear about them. If it’s a good one, I’ll promote it to the top list :)

From foreplay to anal with your girl in 10 easy steps
There is a widespread belief that anal sex hurts and that it’s an uncomfortable experience for women, which is just not right. If your girl has tried it and said it hurts, then probably one of you is doing something wrong. Anal sex, with the right skill set is pleasurable for both men and women. For men - because anal is much tighter and ‘dirty’ then ‘regular’ sex everybody else does. For women – because her anus has even more nerve endings than her vagina and provides a completely different sensation from vaginal sex.
Here are 10 steps that you (both men and women) should follow for an unforgettable night of anal:
1. Girls, clean up
You are devoting attention to a part of your body from which some really nasty stuff comes out. Take a long, relaxing bath before even meeting him. Also, shaving or waxing hair around your anus will actually make you relax, because you won’t get self conscious about how your anus looks, and your guy will get much more ‘up close and personal’ with it.
2. Foreplay is your friend
Romance and foreplay never get old. Start your special night like two lovers who have just met. Kissing, cuddling or even a glass of wine shared in the nude with the lights dimmed will get both of you hot and ready to explore even the deepest parts of each other’s bodies.
3. Buy a water or silicon based lubricant
When having anal, you can never overdo it with lube. Use water or silicon based lubricants; they work well with all types of condoms. Both have their pros and cons.
Water based lubricants are much easier to clean up (their main ingredient is water, so they are washed off easily with more water and some soap) but they don’t last as long and need to be reapplied more often. Also, keep in mind that water based lubricants contain glycerin which can promote infections in women with sensitive skin - so clean up thoroughly after you finish.
Silicon based lubricants are much more greasy and they last longer, but the hard part is washing them off. A good thing is that you can use them in water. Sounds fun, huh?
There is a third type: oil based lubricants, but I advise you to avoid them because they can damage condoms very easily.
4. Start with your finger
Lube up one finger and insert it into her ass. Don’t move it around too much until a girl is comfortable with it. Then start moving it in and out and around, gently penetrating and stretching her anus.
5. Missionary is best for beginners
Choose your position, doggy style may look like the most logical but it isn’t that good for beginners. Missionary (guy on top) is the best position for beginners because it allows the woman to totally relax her anus and enjoy herself.
6. Enter slowly
The girl should pull her butt cheeks apart a bit. Start slowly inserting just the tip of your penis. It’s normal for her to feel some discomfort or slight pain, but that’s only the first one or two times. If it starts hurting more stop and educate yourself some more before continuing.
7. Go deeper
After inserting the tip of the penis, continue to penetrate her deeper with caution. Take your time until she gets used to the new sensation. It can take anything from 30 seconds to 5 minutes for a woman to relax.
8. You did it! Enjoy yourself
Gradually build momentum, vary the speed, angle and depth to achieve maximum pleasure for the both of you.
9. Don’t forget the rest of her body
Stimulate other parts of her body, that will make her more relaxed and it will be more thrilling for both of you. Reach around and focus on her clit for a few minutes. Pull her hair. Kiss her shoulder, lips. Squeeze her butt. Some women can reach orgasm from anal sex alone, but you have much greater chances of making her cum if you stimulate and make her whole body shake.
10. Pull out gently
Immediately following climax, she may become extremely sensitive to penetration. Thrusting or pulling out should be done very gently after orgasm. Also, remember that once your penis has been inside her rectum, don’t put it anywhere else until you have washed yourself or taken off your condom.

How to Make Your Woman Want to Try Anal Sex
You would like to try anal sex with your girlfriend but you don’t know how she might react to such an idea. The problem is that many women are curious or fantasize about anal sex, but they are too afraid to try it because of possible discomfort, safety concerns or bad previous experiences. She might have had an ignorant partner before. Maybe she had anal and it was one of her worst, most painful sexual experiences ever. Instead of asking directly, a good approach is to make her want to try anal sex by herself.
From a scientific point of view, anal sex is pleasurable for women because of concentrated nerve endings around the anus and along the rectum walls. Use this information to your advantage in arousing your woman. The best way to influence your girl to try anal is by introducing her to pleasure through anal play. Getting her accustomed to anal play will gradually let her relax and make her more open to the idea of anal sex. Every time, she’ll allow you to ‘play her ass’ a bit more, finally getting to full anal penetration when the time is right and both of you are prepared.
The key to this approach is to associate anal stimulation with sexual pleasure. The best time to do so is when you are eating her out or in the middle of the intercourse, when she is turned on the most. Squeeze her butt cheeks and wander with your fingers around her crack. While going down on her, try pushing her knees upwards, toward her face and run your tongue as close to her anus as it’s comfortable for the both of you.
Keep an eye on her behavior; if she looks as though what you’re doing is arousing her, keep on doing it. On the other hand, if she starts backing off, slow down a bit. Try next time and she should be more comfortable. Repeat this over and over until gentle rimming becomes a regular part of foreplay/sex.
If you’re getting positive feedback from your girl, the next time you go down on her, lube up and gently brush your finger over her anus, circle around it and look for a response. If she responds positively, continue. In case she backs off, get back to arousing her by other means. Act like nothing happened. Continue to massage her crack while giving her head. By the time you start playing with your finger she should be dripping wet and much more open to trying ‘dirty stuff’. It’s important that you don’t penetrate her until you get some more positive feedback.
Assuming that you were successful, now it’s time to lube your finger up some more. Circle around and try penetrating her ass a bit. Don’t move your finger too much at first. Just hold it in place for a few seconds, so she gets used to the feeling of something inside her backdoor. If she likes what you’re doing (and she should by now), penetrate her with your whole finger and start making gentle circular motions with your whole wrist. She will feel this motion in her vagina. It’s been proven that simultaneous stimulation of a woman’s anus and clitoris or nipples is more satisfying than plain anal stimulation. Lick her breasts, vagina and kiss her whole body while fingering her ass.
Getting your woman aroused goes a long way toward reducing inhibitions. Take advantage of her uninhibited state and you can progress to the point where she’ll allow you to anything to her. ‘Anything’ in this case means penetrating her anus with a finger, then two, or maybe even proceeding to using a small sex toy.
When you get to the point that she likes and is turned on by anal play, you are just a step from anal sex. Take your time, and be patient. After a while, advancing from anal play to anal sex will be a logical ‘next step’.
Try the tactics above and tell me how they worked for you. I love to hear a good success story. Once you’ve got her to try anal for the first time, check out this article on how to make anal sex a regular thing in your relationship. (Coming up soon)

How to Prevent Things From Getting Messy During Anal Sex
Contrary to popular belief, the best way to prevent a mess during anal sex is not anal douching or doing an enema. The best way to avoid a mess is having a healthy diet with lots of fibers, unprocessed foods and enough fluids. Often anal douching and enemas can damage your rectum because chemicals or even water can hurt or dry out the thin mucus lining of the rectum making it prone to injuries when you get to anal sex.
You might ask yourself: why does enema exist if it’s so bad. If you have a bad diet, and you don’t empty your bowels regularly, then it’s ok to use enema sometimes. The enema was actually invented as a cure for constipation about 150 years ago.
If you’ve got a good diet, it will be enough to go to the toilet a couple of hours before having anal sex. Just wash your anus when you go to shower afterwards. Don’t worry, crap isn’t constantly piling up inside your rectum, it piles up in a place called the sigmoid, which is further up your digestive tract. Once it reaches critical mass, it moves to the rectum and you feel like you have to go to the toilet. When you empty it and take a shower you are ready for anal sex.

If You Have Anal Sex, Does it Mean You’re Still a Virgin?
It depends on who’s asking and from which point of view.
By definition: A virgin is a person who has never had sexual intercourse. Sexual intercourse commonly refers to insertion of man’s penis into woman’s vagina, but it’s also used to describe other sexual penetrative acts like anal sex, oral sex or fingering. Now come on, by definition you are not a virgin if you have oral sex? Kind of makes no sense.
Technically: If your hymen is intact (at least not broken by a penis) you are a virgin. But then you go to gynecologist after you’ve had anal sex, she asks if you’ve had sexual intercourse and what would you answer? You’re not exactly a virgin if you say yes.
By religious definition: A virgin is a woman “who has no carnal knowledge of man”. So if you’ve ever seen an erected penis or porn as the matter of fact, you are not a virgin. If you want to marry an Arab prince: Leave your hymen intact, other than that, do whatever you want. Nothing can be proven by a quick eye to private parts check.

Q&A: Can you get pregnant from having anal sex?
Theoretically yes. Practically, the chances are slim and next to none. The urogenital system is completely separate from the gastrointestinal system. In plain English: the vagina and everything above is completely separate from the anus and rectum.
The worst case scenario would be if a guy didn’t wear a condom, ejaculated inside the woman’s anus and then some semen dribbled out of it into the woman’s vagina. That semen would need to contain a sufficient number of live and viable sperm. The chances of sperm travelling in sufficient numbers out of the anus are even lower because all sperm cells would be killed either by time or inhospitable environment of the rectum. Sperm cells themselves don’t really jump around; they need an environment of seminal fluid to survive. So even if it dribbles out of the anus, the surviving sperm crippled by time and surroundings needs to enter the vagina and work its way up to the fallopian tubes and hopefully meet up with egg at just the right time to result in pregnancy.
The other scenario would be if a guy ejaculated directly onto the vagina after pulling his penis out, but you can’t blame anal sex for that. Pregnancy from anal sex therefore - possible but so unlikely it’s practically impossible.

5 Tips for risk-free and enjoyable anal sex
Anal sex can be dangerous, apart from possible back injury, bruised shoulder or a cramp in your foot. There are some real risk factors that you need to know before trying anal. I found this article that handles the subject.
Here are 5 tips for risk free and enjoyable anal sex:
Important:
1. Whatever touches the anus shouldn’t touch anything else.
2. Anal sex is the easiest way to transmit STD-s. Use a condom.
3. The anus is not self-lubricated and it’s prone to physical injury. Lube it up.
4. Pain is there for a good reason: it tells you what not to do. Don’t use anesthetic, If it hurts you’re doing it wrong.
5. Never skip foreplay, use fingers or sex toys until she gets comfortable enough for your penis.
6. Take a nice bath before anal sex.

A Detailed Look at Sex Injuries
Here’s an interesting graphic showing the most common sex injuries, most dangerous places to have sex and objects that get broken most often. These are real facts, and if you think about them a bit you could draw a few conclusions.
If something hurts stop doing it.
If you need to lube use a lubricant, not just any slippery stuff.
If you need a sex toy, think about two other things besides shape. Make sure that it’s strong enough not to break or get squashed under pressure. Also watch out for objects that you might not be able to pull out. Don’t stuff anything into your body cavities that can’t be pulled out by a string or a handle.(Source: digg.com)
