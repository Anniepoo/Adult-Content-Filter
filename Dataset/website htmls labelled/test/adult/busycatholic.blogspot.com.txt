Ex-feminist apologizes to Christians
Former Femen Brazil activist changes her mind
Sara Fernanda Giromin, or Sara Winter, was known as an activist behind many feminist rallies for abortion and gay rights and against religion. But a recent video shows all that has changed.
"We went way too far and ended up offending many religious and non-religious people," she said.
Why the change of heart? The birth of her second child.
"What
I was missing was love (which changed when I became a mother), love
that came to me after having reflected a lot on today's militant
feminism."
Giromin regrets a past abortion and asks Christians for forgiveness for attacking their religion. She has also recently released a book that reveals the ways she was "betrayed by feminism."
"Lesbian and bisexual women have much more voice and respect within the movement, so in the search for recognition of my struggle, with each day that passed, I deconstructed my heterosexuality and was substituting it with an artificial bisexuality," she said.
She donates some funds from the sale of her book toward "women in violent situations and against abortion." Giromin, once leading topless protests, has become a vocal opponent of radical feminism.

PEI group to take government to court over abortion access
Pro-choice group releases announcement today
Pro-lifers hold a silent protest in Fredericton, New Brunswick, May 2014.
Photo submitted to The B.C. Catholic.
There is no hospital or clinic in Prince Edward Island that will abort an unborn child. Now, a new group called Abortion Access Now P.E.I. has released a statement saying they hope to change that.
"P.E.I. women are the only women in Canada without access to safe, legal abortion in their home province."
Today, they announced that they will file a legal challenge against the P.E.I. government. Currently, women travel to New Brunswick or Nova Scotia to end the lives of their unborn infants.
News sources report that the government said it would review the file and "respond accordingly in due course."
