Confession: I have a friend who likes to text me at like 4am when he‚Äôs had nightmares or he can‚Äôt sleep or he just needs a friend. He thinks I‚Äôm always awake at 4am but really I go to bed around 12am and I change his text-tone to the loudest one I have just so it wakes me up when he needs me.
you‚Äôre the kind of friend everyone needs
I think that since its been a year since I made this post its time for an update. In the past year I‚Äôve watched this post grow and grow, people I work with have told me about it as ‚Äúthis post I saw the other day‚Äù and they have no idea it‚Äôs my post. The person I wrote this about has even reblogged it. He is no longer texting me at 4am. Not because we no longer speak but because the nightmares have stopped. He and I both are in a much better place. Most often the only times he‚Äôs waking me up at 4am is when he‚Äôs pulling me closer to him while we sleep. He‚Äôs more than a friend now and I‚Äôm forever thankful to have him. Everyone messaged me saying he was lucky to have me but I think I was just as lucky to have him and I would do it all over.
The update just makes it even better ‚ù§Ô∏è

like leaking the album was not enough you guys decide to post edits with lyrics from unreleased songs from badlands‚Ä¶this is not only extremely disrespectful to halsey but also to all those fans who decided to wait‚Ä¶tf is wrong with you??

So I just starting watching Breaking Bad and not even thirty seconds in a man in his underwear and a gas mask is wildly driving an RV through the desert.
