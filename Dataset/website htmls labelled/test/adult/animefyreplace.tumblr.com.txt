◢ I’m taking a break from tumblr
I haven’t been here much anyways and i’m going to be way busy for the next year pretty much, so i think it’s time to take a break from tumblr to get other things done. I might come back sporadically, but for the most part this blog is gonna be totally dead for a long time.

I absolutely hate when no matter what i do the outcomes are determined by the people that aren’t me. I have no control over anything that happens, and it always destroys me.
