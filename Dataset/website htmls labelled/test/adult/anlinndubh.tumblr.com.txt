Portrait commissions open!I have missed work for around a week‚Äìwhich puts me out around $400‚Äìbecause I‚Äôve been stupidly sick. When I have tried to go to work, my boss has told me to go home because of how bad my cough is‚Ä¶ and the fact that I look like death. Being out $400 from my day job makes it a bit hard to pay the bills. We‚Äôve already had a little bit of financial trouble, trying to make sure the horses stay fed. The last thing we needed was me being sick, but what happens, happens.All of that being said, I am offering portrait commissions. These can be personal portraits (yourself, your family, your pet!) or they can be celebrity portraits/fanart. As noted, I‚Äôm also happy to do animals. Pricing:Full color portrait (as shown above) $80 USDSimple color $40 USDSketch $20 USDAdditional characters would cost more. Please ask me for details. Buy two, get 15% off. That means two $80 portraits would be $136 instead of $160. Mix and match. Please signal boost if you cannot personally commission me. If you are interested in commissioning me, contact me here on Tumblr or e-mail me at saelokason@gmail.com.Thank you!
Buy some rad art from a rad peep!

Today is a good day to get to know the carbon cycle! Lie on the dirt and feel it warming beneath you. Crunch a dry leaf beneath your shoe and think about how you both got to be where you are. Climb a tree and think about how you have genes and elements in common. Consider the implications of the high content of soil. From carbon you come, to carbon you go, from carbon you come again

Raven plays in the snow
As many of you probably know, corvids (jays, ravens, crows, jackdaws, and magpies) are extremely social and intelligent birds, and are known for engaging in all kinds of complex and adorable play. Ravens especially are known to play in snow.
Check out the source video here.
And watch crows and ravens playing on snowy cars and rooftops.
I love Ravens
*squee* Is that a Raven playing with a snowball? Why yes, yes it is.
