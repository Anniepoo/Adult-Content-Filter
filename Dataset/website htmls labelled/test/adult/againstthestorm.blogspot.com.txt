Episode 151 - Explosions ROCK Cedarville
=====================================SCENE ONE - Cedarville Police Department - Crime Lab=====================================It is now the following day & Adam Romano, a CSI at the lab, is working on evidence in a case when longtime girlfriend Natalie Pittman walks in.
Natalie had asked him to help her in her search for her biological parents.
She's also sought help from her student advisor, who is also a licensed Geneaologist on the side.
As Natalie walks in, Adam gives her the impression that he's found something on her parentsNATALIE (Being her usual sweet self when it comes to Adam & smiling) - Hey there!
You look like you found something.Adam leans over, places his hands on the table & bows his headADAM (Acting as though he's not sure how to break the news to her) - Yeah.NATALIE (Noticing Adam's behavior & perplexed by it) - You act as though it's not good.ADAM (Being brutally honest) - That's because it isn't.NATALIE (Even more perplexed) - What do you mean?ADAM (Getting to the point) - Well, you did ask me to search for them using DMV records and/or DNA.NATALIE (Looking REALLY perplexed & wondering what he's revealed) - Yeah....Adam momentarily debates telling herADAM (Afraid to tell her) - Well.....I didn't have to go very far.Natalie assumes that he only had to look them up in DMV recordsADAM (Continuing) - In fact I didn't even have to pull any strings with or call in any favors with anyone at the DMV either.
Nat.....They're in the system.NATALIE (Looking concerned) - So, what does that mean?ADAM (Being blunt) - It means they either have records or are incarcerated somewhere.Natalie looks stunned as she wonders what sort of dirt Adam dug up on themCue New ATS OPENING THEME as we see Natalie practically staring at Adam while trying to process what Adam just told her*******************SCENE TWO - Cedarville High School - Student Parking Lot*******************Aruba Al Faheed is seen locking his car door as he prepares to walk inside the building to go to class.
As he begins his journey towards the door, a van driven by Mark LeRouche, one of those in the plot to blow up the school & frame Aruba for it approaches at a high rate of speed.
As we pick up the scene now, the tires of the old 1970s-style van can be heard screeching as the van rapidly rounds a corner, causing Aruba to look over his shoulder.
As soon as he realizes it's heading right for HIM, he tries everything he can to dodge it, but the other two boys, Steve Bertkowski & Andy Hedgeworth, run up to catch him.
As they eventually do, Mark parks the van so Steve & Andy can drag Aruba, who is now kicking, screaming & otherwise flailing about into the van.MARK - Ya got him?ANDY (Not knowing if anyone heard or saw anything & also not wanting to take any chances on being spotted in case someone called someone in authority) - Drive fool - DRIVE!!As Mark drives to their desination, which is the part of the school where the boiler room is located, Andy & Steve tighten the strap on an old towel rigged to be used as a head mask to place on Aruba's head as they could only get it on with him kicking, screaming & otherwise flailing about & they were more concerned with simply getting him loaded into the van than anything else.
But this will eventually change as a security camera caught th whole abduction.
No one in the camera room spotted it, but the abduction was recorded by the camera.
One problem though.
The camera room is located in the same part of the building as the boiler room.As we pick up the scene now, Mark has just put the van in park & has exited the vehicleMARK (Undoing the strap & removing the fabric) - Well Good Morning Towelhead.
I didn't think you actually WORE one.Mark dangles the jury-rigged Ninja-like towel/head mask in front of Aruba.
It looks like something a terrorist in the Middle East would use when they execute high profile figures or ordinary people such as captured American soldiersANDY (Taunting Aruba) - How's it feel to be THE KIDNAPPED for once instead of being the kidnapper yourself towelhead?STEVE (Adding his $.02 in) - Yeah.
It doesn't feel so good, now does it?ARUBA (Not knowing what else to say) - You punks won't get away with this.MARK - Oh yeah we will.
Because by the time we do what we came here to & when all is said & done, the person that will be blamed will be YOU!!Mark brandishes a .45 caliber hand gun (Legally owned by his dad) & points it Aruba, pressing the end of the barrel just above his nose, yet right between his eyes.
As te scene closes, we see the smiles & other devilish looks on the faces of Mark, Steve & Andy followed by a horrified look on Aruba's face as his eyes bulge while looking squarely at Mark, who is still holding the gun in the aforementioned position*****************SCENE THREE - Brad & Stacy's House*****************Stacy is rummaging through some old DVDs & video tapes for the annual rummage sale that's sponsored by the support group at Fort Cedar.
Among the videos she spots is an old tape she doesn't recall seeing before.
It's wrapped in an all-white holder & isn't labeled.
Thinking it's just one of her old tapes she used to record her favorite soaps with before she got her DVR, she turned on the TV & put it in her DVD/VCR combo.
Little does she know that it is a recording of the interview which Channel 7 did with Debbie Stevens sometime ago.
It's a tape which Brad has been trying to keep from Stacy ever since he got it.
As she watches the tape in ever-increasing shock & disbelief, Brad comes home.
Yet Stacy is so transfixed on the TV, she doesn't even notice his arrival.
When the interview gets to the part where Debbie admits to having an affair with Leo & knowing that Leo was married to Stacy by telling Mark Girardeux that it was Leo himself who told her that Stacy was his wife, she shut off the TV in a fit of rage.As we pick up the scene now, Stacy turns around & sees Brad, who clearly knows the secret is out & he's been caught with the evidenceBRAD (Trying to explain himself) - We wanted to keep this from you.
We didn't want you to get hurt.STACY (Not buying Brad's excuse, feeling betrayed & VERY angry) - Ohh REALLY?!?!?!?
Well guess what Brad - NEWSFLASH - I *AM* hurt.
Hurt by the fact you would try to hide something like this from me.
YOU of ALL people.
I thought I knew you better than that Brad.
I've ALWAYS thought you were a better person than to pull a STUPID DUMBASS stunt than THIS!!!
I'm REALLY disappointed in you Brad.
No in fact, I'm FUCKIN' MAD at you!!BRAD (Trying to be apologetic) - Stace, we're VERY sorry about this.STACY - What's with this "We" business?Stacy then remembers the discreet the video came inSTACY (Hoping that Brad is the only one who knows about the tape) - Ohh my fuckin' god.
PLEASE tell me you're THE ONLY one who knows about this.Brad just bows his head in shameSTACY (Noticing Brad's body language, which is speaking more than A MILLION words ever could right now) Ohh god (Rolling her eyes in the back of her head)
How many other people know about this Brad?Stacy then comes up with a name of someone could EASILY get her hands on an advance copy of the video, which it appears to beSTACY (Continuing) - Does Stephanie know about this?BRAD (Relunctantly answering & doing so in shame as he utters his answer in a soft voice) - Yeah.STACY (Rolling her eyes in the back of her head, throwing her hands up in disgust & smirking sarcastically) - Great.
So who else was on the guest list of the party which I DID NOT EVEN KNOW ABOUT, much less be INVITED to which I presume occured IN OUR OWN HOME Brad?BRAD (Trying once again to explain away his actions) - Stace.....STACY (Rudely cutting him off) SAVE IT.
All I want are NAMES.**************SCENE FOUR - Cedarville Police Department - Crime Lab**************Adam has just explained to Natalie that he found on her biological parents in the system used by law enforcement agencies around the country.
As we pick up the scene now, he is explaining the system to Natalie in a way she can understand it & what her options are should she wish to pursue the matter furtherNATALIE (Surprised) - What do you mean INCARCERATED????ADAM (Trying to explain what he did to find them) - Nat, first I looked them up using DMV records & the national DMV database.
You know, fingerprints, DNA, that sort of thing.NATALIE (Realizing where he's going with this, but fails to see what the big deal is) - Yeah.....ADAM (Continuing but quite truthfully this time) - Well those SAME set of prints popped up on ANOTHER database as well.NATALIE (Curious) - What database is that?ADAM (Directly to the point) - The NCIC databse.NATALIE (Spelling out the acronym since she doesn't know what it means) N-C-I-C??ADAM - The National Criminal Information Center.
It's a database of EVERY known criminal in America.
In other words, if you were to have committed a crime of some kind, you would be in here.NATALIE (Beginning to realize the magnitude of the news) - Are my parents in there?Adam shows her two folders.
Each folder contains the rap sheet for her biological mother & father.
As Natalie reads on, she does so in ever increasing disbelief that the people in those folders are actually her biological parentsNATALIE (In a state of denial over what she just read) - No way - There's just NO FUCKIN' WAY this can be true.
From what I understand about them, they were like 1960s Woodstock yuppies living in the disco era of the 1970s or something.ADAM (Trying to recall what he remembers being taught about the era) - Well....Based on what I know of the era, doing drugs was pretty much considered to be a cool thing.
This was especially true with pot & heroine, the drugs of choice back then since there was no such thing as crack like there is today.NATALIE (Continuing to read the contents of the folders) - So, according to this, they're in prison?ADAM (Forthright in responding)
- Yeah.NATALIE (Still reading one opf the folders) - Well at least I know where they are.
Can I take these with me?ADAM - Sure (Now sympathetically apologetic) - Nat, I'm sorry for being the bearer of such bad news.NATALIE (Wishing Adam wouldn't be so apologetic) - Don't be.
At least you HAD news.ADAM - That's true.NATALIE - Well, I'll talk to you later?ADAM - YeahNATALIE (Smiling) OK....Bye.ADAM (Returning the smile, now getting the feeling that he's her true love even though she's dated - And perhaps even slept with - other guys) - Bye....Natalie exits the lab, leaving Adam to return to his work******************SCENE FIVE - Brad & Stacy's House******************Brad & Stacy are in the midst of a heated confrontation after Stacy found the video of Debbie's interview which depicts, among other things which Debbie says she's not proud of, her affair with Leo.
As we pick up the scene now, Stacy is demanding to know who else knows about the video & why she wasn't told of its very existenceSTACY (Very angry) - Who else Brad?
Who else did you invite to the orgy I didn't even know about?BRAD (Trying to clarify something) - It was no orgy.STACY (Rolling her eyes in the back of her head & snickerishly & sarcastically laughing) - Heh.
Well it had to be SOMETHING Brad.
Something that would get your jollies off.
So why not an orgy?
You DID get your jollies off watching the video, didn't you?
No, wait.
How silly of me.
OF COURSE you did.
I'm just SHOCKED that THE ONE GUY
I **THOUGHT** I knew SINCE WE WERE TODDLERS TOGETHER would stoop so LOW, DIRTY & CHEAP as to pull a stunt like THIS!!!!!
I am ANGRY beyond belief & description at you Brad.
I don't even know you.
The Brad I know - The Brad **I MARRIED** wouldn't EVEN DREAM of doing something ANYTHING like this.
In fact, no.
The Brad I married would think it was low, dirty & cheap too.
The Brad Martin standing in front of me right now DISGUSTS me.
I thought I knew you Brad but OBVIOUSLY not.
In fact, I doubt I **EVER** knew you at all Brad.Brad just looks at her, knowing whatever he says isn't going to bring Stacy down from the proverbial anger high she's on at this point.
What's worse, he knows there's justifiable cause for her to be this way as he'd likely act the same way if he was in her shoes.
Add to this that ANYTHING else he says would likely add additional fuel to the already raging volcanic INFERNO boiling inside her & he of all people knows all too well how angry she can getSTACY (Now demanding an answer to her question) - Now all that out of the way - WHO ELSE KNOWS ABOUT THE VIDEO Brad??Stacy grabs a pad & pen & hands it out for Brad to take as the camera shoots right back to Stacy's beet red face with burning eyes, but all Brad wants to do is try to offer his side of the storyBRAD - Babe.....When we saw the video, what we should all do wasn't taken lightly.STACY (Appalled that Brad even called her "Babe", but then quickly calming herself down so she doesn't do something she'd probably regret later) - DO NOT EVEN....Don't even call me "babe".
Like I said....You're an insignifdicant stranger of no relevance to me whatsoever.Brad now knows there's NO bringing Stacy down from her anger high at this point as she's FAR beyond the point of returnBRAD (Hoping that Stacy will someday see why he & everyone else who saw the video did what they did) - Stace.....Someday, you will see why we did what we did.STACY (Now fed up with the conversation & just wanting to end it) - Brad.....There's NO DAMNED FUCKIN' EXCUSE WHATSOEVER for doing what you did.
NOW GIMMIE THE FUCKIN' NAMESBrad slowly picks up the pad & pen which was thrown down earlier by Stacy as a sign of her rage towards him & reluctantly jots down the names of everyone who has seen the video.
After Brad completes it & puts down the pen, Stacy rips the pad out of Brad's hand & storms out the door, letting her facial expressions & body language do all the talking for her at this point.
When Stacy gets to letting her facial expressions & body language do all the talking, it's a part of her mean streak which only very few have seen but NO ONE has stuck around Cedarville to tell about it.
The last person to incur Stacy's wrath to THAT degree is sitting in a Military Penal Stockade for military crimes.
As the scene ends, Brad is seen in a state of shock & is visibly shaken, fearful of what Stacy's next move, however rationale it may or may not be - MIGHT be*************************SCENE SIX - Cedarville High School - Boiler Room*************************Andy, Steve & Mark have just kidnapped Aruba Al Faheed from the student parking lot just as he was about to enter the building like scores of other students who also drive themselves to & from school.
They then took him literally kicking & screaming to the entrance leading to the boiler room & carried him down the fire escape which the janitor, Mr. Hedgeworth, who's not only in on the whole plot, but is orchestrating it by exploiting the hatred that Andy, Steve & Mark have for Aruba for HIS OWN personal & political agenda, arranged to have free of traffic from those who might get suspicious & expose the whole plot.
As we pick up the scene now, Mark is holding a .45 caliber hand gun (Legally owned by his dad) & points it Aruba, pressing the end of the barrel just above his nose, yet right between his eyes while Aruba trembles & fears for his own safetyMARK (With authority) - Kneel.
KNEELAruba complies, but does so while still tremblingMARK (Again with authority, yet softer) - Put your hands behind your headAruba immediately compliesMARK (Snickerishly laughing as he slowly walks around Aruba) - Look at you.
Down on on your knees.
Hands behind your head.
And to top it all off, you're trembling as if you'd just seen a fuckin' ghost.
Beautiful sight.
Just priceless.
What do you think guys?Andy (Playing One-Upsmanship with Mark at Aruba's expense) - I've got one better.
Cross your feet.MARK (Wondering why he hadn't thought of Andy's idea himself) - Yeah.
Good idea.
(Slightly kicking Aruba's right foot) - Cross 'em.Aruba crosses his feet, putting his right foot over the left oneSTEVE (Also joining in on the game) - I've got another one.
Get on your hands like a fuckin' dog.MARK (Wondering why he hadn't thought of Steve's idea either) - Yeah.
That's BETTER than having them behind your head.
(Now kicking Aruba in the back) - Get on your hands YOU FUCKIN DOG.
Dogs walk on FOUR legs, NOT two.ANDY - You're forgetting man, he's no ordinary dog.Andy, Steve & Mark all laugh & continue to poke fun at Aruba by taunting him & making him do embarrassing things, making Aruba just want to strike back out of sheer self-defense, but he knows he can't because he knows he's outnumbered, but that's when the rough stuff begins.
Andy, Steve & Mark each take turns using Aruba as their personal punching bag.
After a brief period of doing this, that is when Andy, Steve & Mark get down to businessANDY (Smiling) - We've got a surprise for you.Steve & Mark get out the equipment needed to attach the bomb to Aruba's body.
The equipment consists of the bomb itself, a straight-jacket & duct tapeARUBA (Really shaking now as he can already see how he'll be remembered if it's what he thinks it is & it goes off) - Ohh no.
Ohh FUCK NO
Y-Y-Y-You ain't putting that thing on me man.MARK (Devilishly smiling & slightly nodding) - Mmmm....HmmmmmAruba now breaks out in a cold sweat as he makes a mad dash for the door, only to be stopped well short by Andy & Mark as Aruba frantically screams for help while being dragged back to the boilerARUBA (Thinking someone heard his cry for help & will be down here to Andy, Steve & Mark red-handed) - Somebody WILL be down here & catch you guys in the act.
I won't have to say a word.MARK (Again pointing the gun at Aruba's head) - You got that right.
Because YOU won't live to tell about it.STEVE (Reiterating Mark's comment) - Yeah what he said.
And if you think ANYBODY is gonna be down here to help you, let alone that filthy TOWELHEAD WHORE of yours, YOU CAN FORGET IT.
What's her name?
Aaah....Forget it now.
They'll be too busy running for THEIR OWN fuckin lives to even bother with rescuing a low-life loser like you.Andy, Steve & Mark all laugh at Steve's comment.
As they're laughing, Andy & Mark each throw in some derrogatory comments about Aruba's parents as well, which they also laugh atMARK (Not wanting to wait any longer) - I can't wait dudes.
Let's get this thing on him.Andy, Steve & Mark approach Aruba with Andy & Mark holding him while Steve gets Aruba into the straight-jacket, though this wasn't without difficulty.
In fact, the whole process was difficult because Aruba kept resisting.
But they eventually got the straight-jacket on Aruba & the bomb strapped around his chest,
The duct tape was used to muffle his screams & to make any neccessary repairs on rthe fly.
They also had electricians tape in case repairs to the wiring of the bomb itself were needed.
Neither Andy, Steve or Mark saw any & Andy & Steve walked towards the door, leaving Mark alone with Aruba, who was at this point standing up next to the big boilers with duct tape wound around his feet & one of the poles.
As Mark moves towards the door, he does so backwards, pointing the gun at Aruba while yet still making sure he doesn't back over & trip over anything on his way to the doorway.
Once there, he has a few parting words with Aruba.....MARK (Pointing his gun at Aruba) - This is for ruining my '57 Chevy with your JALOPY towelhead.Aruba finds a way to duck, thus avoiding the bullet which came from Mark's gun.
Andy, Steve & Mark all jump in the van they came in.
Meanwhile the bullet from Mark's gun (Actually intented to be used to ensure an explosion in case something were to go wrong) bounces around the boiler room pipes & hits a major line.
This causes several others to emit gas & rupture.
As the scene closes, we see Aruba lying on the floor unconscious as the room fills with smoke & gas followed by an aerial view of the school as what sounds like a thumping sound from the air, yet it's an explosion as shortly afterward, thick black smoke is seen billowing skyward.
From Cedarville International Airport, where WCDR-TV has its helicopter parked on a refueling stop, the smoke can be seen from their ActionCam thereCUE LONG ATS CLOSE WITH CAST & CREDIT SCROLLEFFECTIVE WITH THIS EPISODE There will be an ALL-NEW way in which Against The Storm will close its episodes.
It's new in the sense that it's new for modern day soap operas.
Yet it's old skool for the soap operas of yesteryear.
Think of it as a "Back To The Future" approach as it were.
Each episode from here on out will end like this.....Episode 151 ends with an aerial view of Cedarville High School as now seen by WCDR-TV's Chopper 4, which is hovering overhead.
This video is being fed back to the station, which is frantically trying to get a crew to the scene & do other tasks before going to air with the story.
The view we see alternates between the aerial shot of the school itself as seen by Chopper 4, the view of the school as seen by various other cams along the Channel 4 Action News ActionCam Network & the view of each camera from WCDR-TV's Master Control Room, which shows EVERYTHING from their own cams to what Channel 7 & Channel 12 are broadcasting to the network show which WCDR is broadcasting right now.
Basically put, typical fare of what you would ordinarily expect to find in a TV station master control room or newsroom.
We then see an overlay of the Against The Storm logo as we see a monitor from the WCDR master control room showing the view of Cedarville High School from the ActionCam at Cedarville International Airport (Which is BTW akin to the World Trade Center on 9/11 from the CNN tower in NYC IRL, but adjusted for obvious elevation)

Episode 150 - Political Tensions Hit Cedarville
A NOTE FROM THE WRITER:
After repeated attempts to "speed up" the what-should-now-be-LONG-expired storylines over the last few years (And FAILING MISERABLY in the process every time!), I have decided and reached the conclusion that THE best to achieve that goal at THIS point would be to simply move ahead and press forward with the show in time a few years.
This presents me with the opportunity to roll out NEW storylines NOW rather than to wait until sometime in the future which I think we can all safely agree that will NEVER come thanks to the MANY RL challenges and issues I've had to face over the last few years.
It also presents me with the opportunity to introduce new characters to go along with these new storylines as well as return some old ones for anything ranging from the renewing of old storylines with new vigor and vitality to new storylines altogether.
So with no further adieu, I now present to you THE LATEST episode of AGAINST THE STORM!!
Enjoy!!
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
********************
SCENE ONE - Cedarville University - Student Union Cafeteria
********************
It is lunchtime as Jennifer Blanton, her sorority sisters & a few other friends all sit down to have lunch.
They are all sitting at one table.
Meanwhile Natalie Jenkins, who came into being as a Test Tube baby enters.
Jennifer's sorority sisters nor her other friends have much (If any) use for Natalie at all (This is largely because of her "Miss High & Mighty Goody-Two-Shoes" pompant and arrogant attitude.
In other words, when it comes to Natalie Pittman, think MODERN DAY VALLEY GIRL!!).
FYI ALERT But EVEN WITH Natalie's negative persona & how because of how Natalie came into being, there's a VERY human side to her story too, which you will see being played out over these next coming days, weeks & months. END FYI ALERT.
But because of all the things Natalie has done via her negative persona to attempt (Albeit with short-term success, if any at all I might add) to drive a wedge between Jennifer and her now long-time beau Brian Johanssen, who plans to marry Jennifer once they both graduate (He has proposed to her, but they agreed to wait till they graduated to actually tie the knot even though all their friends and other loved ones think they're CRAZY to put it off out of concern that things could change that would make them fall OUT of love).
As we pick up the scene now, Natalie has just stopped right at the table where Jennifer & Co. are sitting.
JENNIFER (Not surprised at ANYTHING Natalie says or does nowadays since she's practically seen it all from her) - What the fuck do you want?
NATALIE (Feeling offended) - Is THAT the way to treat A HUMAN BEING???
MONICA (One of Jennifer's sorority sisters rather snobbishly) - It's THE PERFECT way to treat YOU.
And, not that you really care, but it's NOT because you were conceived in some fuckin' lab either.
NATALIE (Shrugging off & dismissing Monica's comment as insignificant & irrelevant as she really doesn't care nor believe it anyway) - Fine.
Be that as it may.
But I was wondering if any of you have seen Brian today.
Jennifer suddenly stops her eating & almost gags on the chicken breast sandwich she was holding in her hand as she looks up at Natalie with a VERY suspecting look on her face.
JENNIFER - And WHY pretell should ANY of us tell YOU of ALL people something like THAT???
NATALIE - Because he did what most REAL people tend to do by accidentally leaving his backpack in Biology class.
FYI ALERTNatalie & Brian are both majoring in Biology END FYI ALERT
NATALIE (Now rearing the ugly side of her personality as she holds Brian's backpack by her thumb & forefinger and later looks at it as if it contained a foul odor) - But if you'd rather that he not get it, I could always "burn" it.
JENNIFER (Getting up & just wanting to take it so Natalie would simply GO AWAY as she says firmly & sternly) - Well...Okay.
You can give it to ME - NOW!! You little bitch.
'Cause I just KNOW you're up to
SOMETHING & it ain't no good.
And when it ain't no good, people generally get hurt.
Jennifer offers her hand to accept Brian's backpack as we go to...
**CUE NEW ATS OPEN**
********************
SCENE ONE - Cedarville University - Student Union Cafeteria (CONTINUED)
********************
NATALIE - Last time I checked, YOU had like NO USE WHATSOEVER for Brian.
I think I'll pass.
Somehow I don't think Brian would want his ex-girlfriend like handing his stuff.
JENNIFER (Correcting Natalie's so-called "knowledge" as she's ALWAYS had to do - ESPECIALLY when it comes to Brian) - Well last time *I* checked, 1). That is **NOT** your decision to make because 2). I am
**NOT** his "ex" ANYTHING - HOW MANY times have I corrected you on this now?
I've lost count.
3). Brian has ABSOLUTELY **ZERO** use for you and 4). Because of 1)., 2)., & 3)., if there's ANYONE Brian wouldn't trust his stuff with, THAT WOULD BE **YOU**.
Now hand the bag over or leave it here at the table.
But regardless of what you do, you ARE NOT getting any closer to Brian than this table, so you're just
gonna have to DEAL WITH THAT & ACCEPT IT.
Natalie looks over at the rest of Jennifer's party, but doesn't get any sympathy or even empathy for that matter.
she winds up leaving the bag at the table and leaves to join her own friends
MONICA (Noticing the growing crowd over at the table where Natalie is) - I can hardly believe a slut like her ACTUALLY has friends.
JENNIFER (Whose back is turned to what Monica is seeing as Jennifer resumes her eating) - Yeah.
And most of them are the frat brats who just love the quick fix if ya know what I mean.
MONICA (Nodding in agreement) - Exactly.
The type of man who sees a chick for only ONE thing - S-E-X.
Just then, one of the others in Jennifer's group of friends, Kelly Mashburn, has just completed some work on her computer using the cafeteria's free WiFi connection to the Internet
JENNIFER - So, did you manage to get that assignment done Kelly?
KELLY (Exhausted & closing her laptop PC) - Ugh.
I cannot believe I actually managed to DROWN MYSELF IN MY HOMEWORK during that episode with Natalie - AND AM STILL ALIVE TO TELL ABOUT IT.
Doesn't she EVER learn anything?
MONICA (Looking at Kelly rather strangely) - You're asking US that question?
KELLY - You're right.
How silly of me.
1). We ARE talking about NATALIE here and 2). Because it's Natalie, I doubt even HER TEACHERS would know the answer to that one.
Everyone at the table laughs in agreement as they enjoy the rest of their lunch hour together
********************
SCENE TWO - Cedarville High School - Janitor's Office
********************
Head Janitor Mr. Carl Hedgeworth is working in his office when several boys who work for him in their after-school hours as they learn how to make an honest living by doing janitorial duties walk in.
This is in response to his request to see them.
Mr. Hedgeworth (Or "Mr. H." as the students like to call him as he's so popular) happens to be a politically Right-Wing fascist and self-proclaimed "Right-Wing Anarchist" and has developed quite a reputation with the Cedarville PD as such.
But NOT to the extent as he is about to do so in this scene.
The students for their part are not only Mr. H's employees in after-school jobs, but they're also known to lean extremely to the politically Right on the school's Varsity Debate Team and have a reputation in the school district of
RESOUNDINGLY outsmarting EVERYONE they've encountered on the political Left so far.
As we pick up the scene now, the students, Mark, Andy & Steve, are about to find out why Mr. Hedgeworth called them into his office.
MARK (To Mr. Hedgeworth as he, Andy & Steve enter) - You wanted to see us?
MR. HEDGEWORTH - Yes.
Come right on in.
The boys enter the office and close the door behind them
MR. HEDGEWORTH - Now you boys have developed quite the reputation of dealing with the clueless Liberals in the school district, haven't you?
STEVE (Wondering where the discussion is leading to) - Well yeah, through our work on the varsity Debate Team, but....
MR. HEDGEWORTH (Interrupting Steve) - Exactly, but you also know that this city has a HUGE Towelhead population, right?
ANDY (Just as perplexed as his two fellow students are) - Yeah but...
MR. HEDGEWORTH (Interrupting Andy) - What does this have to do with the price of beans in China or your after-school jobs here, I know.
But THIS is an IMPORTANT job boys.
THIS is something that the politicians (Even the most loyal ones to our humble cause) would cringe at.
The three students look at each other as if to ask "What is he talking about?"
MR. HEDGEWORTH (Noticing the perplexed looks on the boys faces) - Do you remember when this school had A SHITLOAD of them Towelheads?
ANDY - Heh...Yeah.
MR. HEDGEWORTH - Well several things happened to make them leave.
Some graduated.
Some were forced to move out of the area because of other mitigating circumstances and some will say they were "forced out".
The latter is likely because of your bullying them and our troops (Now smiling) umm....shall we say....Takin' care of business by KICKIN' SOME TOWELHEAD BOOTY over in Iraq & Afghanistan....
STEVE - I think I get the picture, but where is this leading to?
MR. HEDGEWORTH - Simply put, there's ONE Towelhead who's still here.
I think you all know EXACTLY who I'm referring to.
You guys have tried EVERYTHING IMAGINABLE to get rid of him, yet he's still here.
But I've come up with a plan that will do away with him ONCE AND FOR ALL.
MARK (Appearing interested) - What's the plan Mr. H?
I'll try ANYTHING to get rid of him at this point as he ALWAYS parks his fuckin' bomb next to my classic '57 Chevy EVERY STINKIN' DAY and I'm TIRED of him doing it.
MR. HEDGEWORTH (Smiling) THAT IS THE SPIRIT NOW!!!
As for the plan, it's simple.
Just assemble the parts for a pipe bomb and put it in the Boiler Room.
ANDY (Stumped) - But where does the Towelhead fit in?
MR. HEDGEWORTH - You guys will come up with a way to push, pull, and/or DRAG HIM kickin' and screamin' if you have to over to the Boiler Room.
STEVE - How do we get him down there without getting caught?
MR. HEDGEWORTH - You don't.
I'll give you access to the outside entrance.
STEVE - What about the guard?
He's DEFINATELY bound to get suspicious.
MR. HEDGEWORTH - I'll keep him busy.
He and I are pals anyway.
MARK - Okay, but once we get the Towelhead inside the Boiler Room, what are we supposed to do with him?
MR. HEDGEWORTH - Use whatever force and means neccessary to get him to place the pipe bomb underneath the big boiler.
Believe me, you can't miss it.
MARK - What about our DNA being on the bomb parts when its found in some form?
MR. HEDGEWORTH - Well, if you're as smart as I think you are, you'll pre-assemble the bomb BEFORE arriving at school.
This way, the steam will dust off any old DNA like a baseball umpire dusting off home plate during a ballgame.
STEVE - And the Towelhead's DNA?
MR. HEDGEWORTH (Smiling) Will be all over it.
MARK - So what do we do once he bends over and starts sliding the bomb under.
MR. HEDGEWORTH - Get the hell out of there like bats out of hell.
ANDY - What about the Towelhead?
STEVE - Yeah.
He can name us if he's caught.
MR. HEDGEWORTH (Smiling) - Ahh but WHO in their right mind is gonna believe a fuckin' Towelhead standing next to a boiler with a pipe bomb WITH HIS DNA ALL OVER IT under the boiler in the Boiler Room?
I don't know of anyone.
Do you?
MARK (Smiling & Devilishly Laughing) - I like THIS plan.
This CAN work.
Thanks Mr. H.
When do you want us to do this?
MR. HEDGEWORTH - Tomorrow if possible.
MARK (Confident & Cocky) - Then tomorrow it is as tomorrow will be THE LAST time he will be parking his bomb next to my '57 beauty.
********************
SCENE THREE - Brad & Stacy's House
********************
Brad Martin & Stacy McFadden are married now.
As such, they are now obviously living together on a full time basis.
FYI ALERT They decided to do so on a last second "spur-of-the-moment" thing once
Stacy was able to convince the courts to let her have sole custody of the last memoir of Leo's legacy - that being his son Christopher since his natural mother Cassandra Whitmore is still serving time in the penal stockade at Fort Cedar for illegally obtaining a sample of Leo's DNA so she could have proof of Leo being Christopher's biological father. END FYI ALERT
As we pick up the scene now, Brad & Stacy are enjoying a nice lunch together before Brad heads back to the hotel where he expects to have a long night since there will be a gala event for a Presidential candidate at The Fon Du Lac later in the evening.
BRAD (Asking Stacy what she thinks of the candidate who's coming to town) - So what do you thing of the guy?
STACY (Responding in what many so-called real life political "experts" might consider to be "realistic") - Does it really matter what *I* think of a particular candidate anymore?
I mean seriously, all you need to have is enough money and you can just simply **BUY** your way into the White House.
Holding an election has just merely become a constitutional formality these days.
BRAD - You really don't believe that, do you?
STACY - Do you really think your vote **ACTUALLY** counts Brad??
Earth to Brad....My sweetie - IT DOES NOT.
There **USED** to be a time in which a person's vote **ACTUALLY** meant something.
But not anymore.
All that's needed nowadays to get into public office is M-O-N-E-Y and lots of it.
BRAD - Well I'm still a firm believer that a person's vote still means something.
STACY - Fine sweetie.
You have your opinion and I have mine.
Thankfully we live in a country where both of us are still entitled to each other's opinion.
But honey, sooner or later, you're going to realize that your opinion is a figment of your imagination and that reality dictactes what I've said and believed all along for the last several years.
Just then, a political ad for the presidential hopeful appears on TV
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IN TV AD (In a quoted statement from a previously recorded speech) - I will bring about CHANGE and restore HONESTY & DIGNITY to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
STACY (Responding to the quote) - Didn't the last presidential candidate who **BOUGHT** his way into 1600 Pennsylvania say something similar to that?
Hmm...Lookie what he did.
He turned the world's tallest buildings into a great big pile of rubble and has thus far been linked to more deaths than **ADOLPH HITLER** - And HE was nothing more than **A CRAZED LUNATIC** who should **NEVER** have been elected into power in the first place.
And THE SCARY part is THAT IS ONLY THE BEGINNING!!!
I'm just barely scratching the tip of the iceberg of some of the things that's happened since our current President first took office.
BRAD (Noticing Stacy's obvious cynicism & criticism) - You're so cynical & critical of politicians these days.
You've gotta learn to give 'em a break and pat 'em on the back for the good things they HAVE done Stace.
STACY - Brad, you would be too if *YOU* had a loved one who was repeatedly being sent into a war we have **NO BUSINESS** being in in the first place.
Sorry sweetie, but while I respect your opinion and love you because you at least have one, I can't possibly agree with it.
Nor can I possibly expect you to agree with mine unless you've actually lived in my shoes the last several years.
BRAD - But sweetie you know I've right at your side the whole time and certainly since Leo's death.
STACY - But it's NOT the same thing.
(Now fumbling for a way to explain the point she trying to make to Brad, but is at a loss for words) It's too complicated to explain to you in a way you could possibly understand.
So you're just gonna have to trust me on this on Brad.
It's NOT the same thing.
BRAD (Wanting to just simply agree to disagree and not push the matter any further) - Alright.
It's quite clear that when it comes to this subject, we obviously have two very different opinions and that is just simply not going to change.
So how about we call a truce and just simply agree to disagree.
STACY (With a smile) - Now THAT, my dearest loved one, I will MOST CERTAINLY agree to.
Stacy & Brad begin to hug one another, but just then Brad notices his watch and realizes he has to leave and get back to the hotel
BRAD - Whoa!
I'd better get the fuck outta here and get back to the hotel before Michelle decides to have my head served up on a platter for being late.
See you later?
Brad & Stacy manage to get in a quickie kiss just as Brad heads out the door
STACY (As she sighs, shrugs her shoulders and lets her knees buckle down to the sofa) - Yeah.
Laters.
As the scene ends, Stacy's own two year old daughter can be heard crying in the background as she awakens from her nap while Stacy picks up the remote control for the TV and starts channel surfing
********************
SCENE FOUR - Cedarville PD Crime Lab - CSI Adam Romano's Workstation
********************
Adam Romano is a CSI for the Cedarville PD Crime Lab.
As we pick up the scene now, Adam, a graduate of the Cedarville University School Of Criminal Justice and old acquaintance and flame of Natalie Pittman during his college days, is busy at work when Natalie walks in
FYI ALERT Another reason why Adam & Natalie were forced to break things off between the two of them is the fact that Adam is now legally considered to be an adult while Natalie is still legally considered to be a minor under State Law EVEN THOUGH she's a Senior in college. END FYI ALERT
NATALIE (With a smile) - Hey there
ADAM (Returning the smile with one of his own) - Wow.
Don't you look gorgeous.
Long time no see babe.
NATALIE (Blushing, but trying to be modest - however not succeeding) - You know I *ALWAYS* look gorgeous.
ADAM (Admitting that he knows she's right and being somewhat macho about it as he walks over to her to give her a hug) - Well yeah, but still...
Natalie & Adam exchange hugs
ADAM (Continuing) - So what's up?
What brings you by here?
NATALIE - Personal project.
ADAM - Ohh...Well...What can I do to help?
NATALIE - Well you know I was born in well....you know....a lab, right?
ADAM (Recalling her mentioning it to her) - Well yeah.
I remember you mentioning it quite a few times.
NATALIE - Well now I've reached the decision that now is just as good of a time as any to at least start the search for my parents.
ADAM (Perplexed) - What do you mean?
NATALIE (Looking at Adam with a "RENT-A-CLUE" expression on her face) - Well you know.
The two people who...umm.... decided it was best to "donate" me to modern medicine & science as if I were just some "thing" rather than a real person with emotions and feelings when the sperm & eggs were mixed together.
ADAM - Ahh...I follow now.
But are you sure that's such a hot idea?
I mean, suppose they don't want to see you.
NATALIE - That's the chance I'll have to take.
But I'd like to AT LEAST be able to have the chance to get to know them or AT LEAST get the chance to MEET them.
ADAM (Trying to be realistic) - Nat, they may not wanna see you.
Worse yet, they themselves may not want that.
NATALIE - I know.
That's what the Genealogist told me.
ADAM - You working with one.
NATALIE - Yeah.
She's looking up my family tree as I speak.
ADAM - Cool.
So what do you need me for?
NATALIE - Well you've got access to all kinds of information about them, right?
ADAM - Eh...If they're in the system, yeah.
NATALIE - Well don't you have access to...like...information for...like....motor vehicles, right?
ADAM - Well yeah.
I have access to the Motor Vehicle database.
NATALIE - Well you could pull it from there, couldn't you?
ADAM - It's possible.
But Nat, if a person doesn't want to be found or doesn't want anyone that they're alive, there's lots of ways to achieve that and do so legally.
NATALIE (Sighing) - What if we were able to come up with names?
ADAM - That'd help, but if it's a common name like JOHN SMITH, that's too common as there's THOUSANDS of people out there with that name.
NATALIE - Ahh...But only one that's in the family line.
ADAM (Almost laughing) - It'd have to be one very lucky needle in one helluva haystack Nat.
NATALIE - Who knows?
Stranger things have been known to happen.
ADAM (Sighing) - Okay.
You get me some names and anything else that you and your Genealogist friend believe might be helpful and I'll see what I can do.
NATALIE (Smiling, knowing that she's got his support) - Great.
ADAM (In his now-usual typical CSI fashion) - I can't promise you any results Nat.
NATALIE - Just promise me you'll try.
Okay?
ADAM - For you?
Yeah?
NATALIE - Thanks again sweetie.
ADAM (Smiling) - Yeah.
Natalie starts to leave
ADAM (Verbally Catching Natalie as she leaves & smiling rather fondly) - Hey...
NATALIE (As she turns around) - Yeah?
ADAM (Smiling) - Great seeing ya again.
Talk to ya later.
NATALIE (Smiling rather fondly in return) - Likewise.
Well...Thanks again.
Talk to ya later.
Natalie walks out as Adam looks on as the scene comes to an end
********************
SCENE FIVE - The FonDuLac Hotel - Grand Ballroom
********************
Owner & now Hotel Diva Michelle Monroe is busily preparing the Grand Ballroom for the HUGE reception for Presidential candidate Congressman Gary Wheatley who is a very close personal friend of hers even though he has refused her many campaign monetary contribution offers.
As we pick up the scene now, she is frantically directing staff to do various tasks as she runs around looking as though she were a chicken with her head cut off and as she pulls her hair out wondering where "Mr. No Problem in a situation like this" Brad Martin is
MICHELLE (Out of frustration & looking at her watch) - UGH!!
I'm gonna KILL him!!
Just then, Brad enters the room, but quickly sees that facing Michelle is going to be THE LAST thing he's gonna wanna do, but it won't matter now as she sees him
MICHELLE (To Brad as she storms up to him) - WHERE HAVE YOU FUCKIN' BEEN??
Do you realize I've been running around like a chicken with her head cut off trying to get this place in order for the reception tonight?
BRAD - I was having lunch with Stacy.
Remember?
I knew I wasn't gonna be able to have dinner with her due to the reception, so we chose to have lunch instead.
I thought we talked about all this.
MICHELLE - Well I wasn't neccessarily counting on staying over there as long as you did.
BRAD (Sarcastically & feeling somewhat underappreciated for all the work he DOES do at the hotel) - Sorry.
Maybe next time I'll stay shorter or better yet, skip having lunch with my wife altogether just so I can be here to serve your Royal Highness when you decide to play host to such big events.
MICHELLE (Just wanting to end the confrontation) - Just get the registratation area set up, please...
BRAD - Alright.
MICHELLE - Thank you.
Brad heads over to the area marked REGISTRATION and starts coordinating things over there.
Meanwhile, Michelle returns to her traffic directing when Rob enters with Congressman Wheatley, who is getting the grand tour of the hotel
ROB - Michelle my dear love, may I present to you old friend CONGRESSMAN Gary Wheatley.
MICHELLE (Charmed) - Congressman
CONGRESSMAN WHEATLEY - YOU Michelle can call me Gary.
MICHELLE (Still charmed) - Okay GARY
CONGRESSMAN WHEATLEY (Giving his personal review of the hotel as the two of them sit at one of the many tables in the room) - I cannot believe that YOU built this FANTASTIC & EXQUISITE hotel.
I would've figured it would be something your father would have a hand in.
MICHELLE (Flattered) - Aww...Thanks.
But as I'm sure Rob has probably told you by now, Daddy had nothing to do with it.
It was all my own idea.
CONGRESSMAN WHEATLEY (Admiring Michelle's work) - And a GREAT one at that.
The stuff you have proven that CAN be done if you apply yourself is truly amazing.
A sight to behold.
MICHELLE (Smiling) - Well it's a sight that I hope will be here for many generations to come.
CONGRESSMAN WHEATLEY - As do I.
(Now looking at his watch) - Well, now that I've had the grand tour, I'd better get back upstairs and finish preparing for the reception tonight.
Nice seeing ya.
MICHELLE (Smiling as Congressman wheatley gets up) - Likewise.
(Just before Congressman Wheatley exits the room) - Ohh hey!! One more thing.
KNOCK 'EM DEAD!!
Congressman Wheatley sticks his thumb up in a cheerful fashion as Michelle smiles & looks on as the scene draws to a close
********************
SCENE SIX - Mark's House
********************
It is now after school hours and the boys have agreed to meet at Mark's house to plan out their devious plot since his parents are both out of town on business for their respective employers and the person in charge of looking after him in their absence, who BTW is their neighbor, is busy at work herself.
As we pick up the scene now, Mark & his two cohorts are in the family garage gathering stuff they think they can use.
They're also discussing other things.
ANDY - And what if we get caught?
MARK - Trust me, if we do what Mr. H. said to do, we ain't gonna get caught.
There's NO WAY that's gonna happen.
There'll be too much confusion and chaos.
STEVE - He's right man.
We ain't got any worries in the world man.
ANDY - I'm just think about the WHAT IF.....
You know?
MARK - Dude....Stop being such a wuss.
Now let's see what else we can use here.
The three spot a bunch of miniature PVC pipes in a box
STEVE (Admiring the number of pipes in the box) - WHOA!!
We could make use of these.
Think you can use your knowledge of science to make a bomb with these Andy?
ANDY (Looking into the box himself) - FUCK YEAH!!!
And I wouldn't even have to cut them down to size either.
They're PERFECT.
MARK - Then let's get right to work.
The three try to look for other things in the garage they can use, but are unsuccessful.
They then try the basement, but have no luck.
Next they check out the stuff at Steve's house.
Steve's dad is an electrician.
They grab stuff to make a timer and other electrical things.
Next they move on to Andy's house.
Andy's mom is an explosives expert who, ironically, owns a demolition company whose biggest client just happens to be - AL FAHEED CONSTRUCTION INC..
As we pick up the scene again, Mark & Steve notice the Rolodex on the desk of Andy's mother and are curiously thumbing through it.
STEVE (Pulling out Khalil Al Faheed's business card from the Rolodex) - Well....Well....Well.
What do we have here?
A TRAITOR!!
ANDY (Trying to downplay it as just being part of his mother's business) - It's just my mom's business.
MARK - Well obviously.
YOUR MOTHER FUNDS & PROVIDES SUPPORT FOR TERRORISTS.
Wake up & smell the coffee man.....
ANDY - My mom does her own thing.
So does my dad.
STEVE - So what does HE think about all this?
ANDY - He's a Wall Street dude.
He's too fuckin' busy traveling all over the whole damned world strikin' multi-zillion dollar deals as he kisses the ass of his fuckin' boss.
He could give a shit about me & mom.
We could fall off the face of the Earth and he wouldn't notice it.
MARK - Don't tell me he travels to the Middle East.
ANDY - Naah.
That much I can tell you.
He mainly travels to Europe, but on occasion he'll also travel to the Far East.
STEVE - Well we better check to see what we can find here and get the fuck out before his mom comes home.
MARK - Yeah you're right.
We'd better get started.
(Now admiring all the tools of the explosives trade & deviously grinning from ear-to-ear) - That Towelhead has NO idea what he's in for or what's in store for him.
FADE TO BLACK

The Story Of Debbie Stevens
Debbie, as you may have gathered by now, is hardly a sweet little angel.
In fact, as you're about to see, even her own mother never thought very highly of her when she was alive.
But unlike Cassandra Whitmore (And despite what her now-dead mother might've thought of her), Debbie has morals.Debbie's problems however are the bloodlines that she and her mother share and HER JUDGEMENT.
She's not very good at thinking BEFORE she acts or takes action and, as we've all witnessed so far, she's also one to not let go of grudges so easily.
As such, she has a tendency to want to inflict as much pain on her intended victim as possible.
Problem with that is, as you're about to see, her pain-inflicting actions can also sometimes have unintended consequences (Such as hurting other people IN ADDITION to her intended victim).Her mother was a street hooker whose specialty was standing on street corners turning tricks (When she managed to avoid getting busted for prostitution that is).
As such, her "profession" of choice eventually caught up with her as one night, she was murdered by one of her many johns who decided he was going to use her as his personal sex slave.
When he was done, he dumped her body in a nearby dumpster where she was later found.
David & Marcie worked the case, found the perpetrator who committed the crime, and managed to get him locked up where he still remains today.Her problem with her judgement (Or should we say LACK OF GOOD judgement) has more often than not landed her in trouble with quite a few people EVEN THOUGH she maintains a large group of friends (Many of whom either know of or have been caught in the cross-hairs of some of her actions).With that out of the way, we bring you [b]The Story Of Debbie Stevens[/b] & her involvement in the sordid story of Leo & his womanizing behavior.
We start with [b]Episode 58 Scene One[/b] as Debbie meets Mark & his photographer at The FonDuLac Restaurant.[i]My, you sure got here in a hurry[/i], Debbie says, admiring Mark's timing.[i]You know me.
I don't like to miss a good story[/i], Mark replied.
[i]So my darling, what's the scoop on Leo?[/i], he asked.[i]Not so fast.
First some business, if you know I mean[/i], Debbie exclaims, expecting payment for the story.Mark chuckles.
Debbie chuckles back with her hand out expecting money to be put in it.[i]How 'bout you tell me what the scoop is and I'll determine how much its worth?[/i], Mark offers, chuckling at first[i]How 'bout we do half and half?[/i], Debbie counteroffers.[i]How 'bout the meter is ticking as we speak[/i], Mark puts it bluntly[i]Well, since you put it THAT way...[/i]Debbie gives Mark a little teaser.
When he feels he has enough, he asks Debbie to stop and tells the photographer to start rolling.
With that, the interview begins and Debbie spills the guts of her love life for all of Cedarville to see and hear.After the interview, the three have appetizers and then part ways.
Debbie goes back to the meeting to attend the reception while Mark & the photographer head back to the station.
While en route back, Mark is thinking he may just have the bombshell of the year.Getting back to Debbie, she arrives at the reception, but not long after that, she has yet another "visit" from her mother, who has been dead for years after her body was found in a dumpster after one of her many "happy customers" got through using her as his sex slave (One of the many cases which David & Marcie worked and solved).
This took place in [b]Episode 58 Scene Four[/b][b][i]My oh my oh my.
Like mother like daughter I see[/b][/i], says the ghostly spirit of Margaret, Debbie's dead mother.[i]Wha...Who's there?[/i], Debbie asks, thinking she heard a voice.[b][i]Why it's your mother[/b][/i], Margaret's ghostly spirit says.[i]Nnnn....No.
My mother's dead.
I'm hearing things.[/i], Debbie responds[b][i]I'm right here.
You can't escape me[/b][/i], Margaret's ghostly spirit says.[i]That's just a facsimilie replication of mother's voice.
It isn't the real thing[/i], Debbie tells herself reptitively as she pours herself a cup of punch.[b][i]I'm not a facsimilie replication sweetie.
I'm in your every waking thought and dream.
You know that[/b][/i], Margaret's ghostly spirit says.[i]No you're not.
I don't know who you are, but this isn't funny.
Just go away[/i], Debbie says as she gathers a small plateful of munchies, which are part of the self-serve ala carte food area of the reception.[b][i]Stop trying to deny who you are sweetie.
You may be able to fool your so-called "friends", but you can't fool me.
Remember, I'm your mother.
I'm in your every waking thought and dream.[/b][/i]Margaret's ghostly spirit says.[i]So GET OUT of my thoughts and dreams then[/i], Debbie responds[b][i]So you couldn't hack it on the street, eh?
You just HAD to join the military[/b][/i] Margaret's ghostly spirit says.Debbie doesn't respond.[b][i]So tell me, How's the fuck?
Is the fuck any better with the military boys as opposed to the average john I fucked around with?
You know, I hear many of these bases have streets on them.
Have you tried hanging out on one of THOSE street corners while turning tricks?[/b][/i], Margaret's ghostly spirit asks.[i]I'm NOT like you mother.
NEVER have been.
NEVER will be.[/i][b][i]NEVER say never sweetie.
Bloodlines ALWAYS have their ways of BITING YOU IN THE ASS[/b][/i], Margaret's ghostly spirit says.[i]Yep, you oughta know.
That's how come I've alive and you're dead.
I'm not a FUCKIN' whore like you and grandma were[/i], Debbie sarcastically retorts.[b][i]Don't you EVER talk about your grandmother like that.
I'm here to defend myself so I can take it.
But I don't EVER want to hear you talk that way about your grandmother.
ONCE a slut ALWAYS a slut sweetie.
Your grandmother was one, I was one, and YOU, my darling, are merely next in line.
It's just a matter of time before those raging hormones of yours explode[/b][/i] Margaret's ghostly spirit adamantly responds.[i]NOT if I can keep from it or have any say in the matter.
Listen just do me a favor and GO AWAY[/i], Debbie says, now in frustration as she begins to hear people walking into the reception hall.[b][i]I told you, I can't.
I'm your mother.
I'm in your every waking thought and dream.
I can't leave them because I know you're always thinking about me - Especially now that you're showing your true colors of being the slut I've always thought you were.
You've got the talent to turn tricks if you really wanted to do it.
You don't think I've seen you in that mess hall in Afghanistan?
How 'bout that one in Iraq?
THINK AGAIN SWEETIE.
You had them boys just BEGGING you let them squeeze those giant boobs of yours.
You know, the ones your now-thankfully dead husband gave you?
Why even I was getting horny.
In fact, I seemingly recall three or four of those boys wanting to breed you gangbang-style and use you whenever they needed to "fulfill the need" and/or to make babies with you.
Basically, they only wanted you for your giant boobs, your ass and that tight sweet pot of honey you have between your legs.
In other words, they wanted you to be their bitch while they got their jollies off.
(Chuckle) Yeah, you're a true slut alright.
A chip off the ol' block[/b][/i], Margaret's ghostly spirit says, chucking and smiling as she recalls some of the memories.[i]JUST GO AWAY MOTHER!!!!![/i], Debbie screams in frustration, slamming her food and drink down on the floor as she does so.Just then, Stacy walks in and sees Debbie in her anguish[i]Debbie...Are you alright?[/i], Stacy asks with a stunned, yet puzzled look on her face and noticing that Debbie looks like she'd just seen a ghost.[i]Yeah.
Let's have the reception and get the fuck out of here[/i], Debbie responds as she tries to collect herself from the out-of-mind, out-of-life, out-of-body experience she just endured.Later on in Scene Six, Stacy tried to press Debbie on the matter....[i]Who were you talking to?[/i], Stacy asked[i]Nobody[/i], Debbie responds.[i]Didn't sound like much of a 'nobody' to me[/i], Stacy countered.
[i]Doesn't look like it either[/i], she continued.[i]You wouldn't know[/i], Debbie countered.[i]Try me[/i], Stacy challenges[i]Just this guy I've been dating[/i], Debbie makes up in an effort to end the conversation.[i]I see[/i], Stacy responds, thinking she's just been fed a bunch of BS [i]I didn't know there were any guys who go by the name of 'mother'[/i], she continues[i]Huh?[/i], Debbie questions, wondering what Stacy is even talking about.[i]When I walked in here, you were referring to your mother as you slammed your food and drink on the floor and you said something to the effect of "go away"[/i], Stacy responds [i]Care to go into it?[/i], she continued[i]Not particularly[/i], Debbie said [i]And I would prefer that you not blab it all over the place either[/i], she continued[i]Okay, but I don't understand....[/i], Stacy responds[i]Look, I know you're trying to be helpful and just trying to be a friend and all, but as far as I'm concerned, I don't have a mother.
I never did have anyone to call 'mother' and I never will have anyone to call 'mother'[/i], Debbie exclaims[i]But Deb, EVERYONE has a mother and they love us very much[/i], Stacy said[i]Not mine.
If you ask me, they should've left her in that dumpster she was found in.
That was the PERFECT place for her.[/i], Debbie retorts [i]Look Stace, I know you're just trying to be a friend, but beyond this place and the things about me which I've already brought up in our meetings, you don't know JACK SHIT about me.
So let's just DROP the subject while we ARE still friends.[/i], Debbie says, insisting on ending the conversation[i]Okay sure[/i], Stacy says [i]Look, I'm sorry.
I just got a little too pushy and obviously stuck my nose where it didn't belong.
I'm sorry[/i], Stacy apologetically says[i]It's okay[/i], Debbie says [i]Having a whore who spent more time standing on street corners turning tricks than she did being a real mother to me isn't something I'm exactly proud of[/i], she continued[i]I understand[/i], Stacy said[i]No Stace, I don't think you do.
At least not in full anyway.[/i], Debbie responds
[i]Listen...About not telling anybody, I'm serious.
I don't want anybody else to know.
this is to be just between you and me.
Our little secret.
Okay?[/i], Debbie says as she asks for Stacy's respect in the matter.[i]Alright, I'll respect your wishes.
Besides, I think the LAST thing we need to do is to give our resident gossip columnist Maxine Greenwald something to blog about if you know what I mean.[/i] Stacy sarcastically, yet humorously responds.[i]Heh yeah so VERY true....As if she doesn't have enough to blab about as it is.[/i], Debbie saysDebbie & Stacy giggle & laugh at the notion of that as the scene ends.Meanwhile, back at the Channel 7 studios, the newscast is just about to begin.
During the newscast, Michelle arrives at her newly-purchased condo which she and fiancee Rob now call home after a long hard day at work running the hotel.
She flips the TV on to watch the news.
She normally watches Channel 7 even though she knows their tablodish-style approach of presenting the news almost always drives Rob NUTS (He hates tabloid news).
As she goes about the business of doing her thing, which is normally taking off her shoes, grabbing a drink (Usually a glass of wine), and preparing to unwind, the story of Debbie's interview is coming on.During the report, Rob arrives at home himself and goes to join his wife-to-be.
He spots her in the Entertainment Room with her eyes glued to the TV.
He calls out to Michelle, who tells him that he should come see what she's watching.
Rob does so.
His first reaction is the Channel 7 logo at the bottom of the screen and tells her to look at the source and that only Channel 7 would stoop to such a low level to get a story for their newscast.Just then, the report goes into Debbie's admitting she had an affair with Leo.
Rob & Michelle had met Debbie before when all the military families had a big support convention in Cedarville, but they had NO idea that she had ANY connection TO LEO.
With that, Rob suddenly picks up the phone.
Michelle asks who he's calling.
She tells her he's calling Brad.
Brad picks up the phone on his end.
Rob asks what channel they were watching for the news.
Brad said they were watching their usual source for news, which is none other than Channel 4, the station that Stephanie Blanton works for.
Rob tells him to flip it to Channel 7.
Brad asks why.
Rob tells him to just do it and quickly because the report was about to come to an end.
He does so, though he still wants to know what's going on.No sooner does he ask that question, Channel 7 broadcasts a teaser as to what they plan to air during their 10:00 PM newscast.
Brad is shocked at what he sees as are Rob & Michelle.
Brad then asks Rob if they recorded the report.
Rob relays the question to Michelle, who says no.
Brad relays her answer to Brad, who acknowledges and tells them to get over to their house so they can figure out how to break the news to Stacy.
Rob says that he and Michelle are on their way and hangs up the phone.
Brad hangs up the phone on his end.While Rob & Michelle are en route to the house, Brad calls Stephanie and asks her if she knew anything about the Channel 7 broadcast.
She said she heard something about it, but the info. she had was either second or third hand since she was on the air herself on Channel 4, though she did note the pickup of buzz in the newsroom that apparently came as a result of the report.
Brad asked Stephanie if there was ANY way she could get the video of the broadcast that's supposed to go on the air at 10:00 PM.
She said it was highly unlikely at this point as that would mean either taking or destroying all the backup copies of the video as well.
And even then, doing so would be at the risk of getting caught and hauled off to jail.
But she said she'd pull a few strings and call in a few favors and see what she could do to help as she knows that if ANY part of what she'd been hearing on the matter through the grapevine that's the Channel 4 newsroom so far is true, Stacy would surely be devastated.With that assurance from Stephanie, Brad hung up the phone.
His next call was to Greg.
He said he saw it and was shocked by the revelation.
Brad told him to head on over and said that Michelle, Rob & Stephanie were also on the way over.
Greg asked if Stacy was going to be there, but Brad said no, figuring that Stacy might wanna spend some time with Trish Martin, who had her own woes with the trial of those who attacked her going on.
He also said that Stephanie was gonna do what she could to pull some strings over at Channel 7 so she could get an advance copy of the video of what they plan to feature during the 10:00 PM newscast.
Greg said he was on his way over and hung up.
Now he just had to hope and pray Stacy chose to stop by Trish and Michael's place for a bit before coming home as that would give him at least SOME time for he and everyone else to figure out how they were gonna break the news to Stacy - IF they can even get up the gumption to do it.No sooner had he got off the phone with Greg, the doorbell rang.
It was Rob & Michelle.
Brad of course let them in.
Eventually everyone showed up.
Stephanie got the advance copy she wanted, but not before calling Mark Girardeau on the carpet as well as a few choice names and blackmailing a producer by threatening to go public with some "dirt" she "dug up" on him (She also made the same threat against Mark even though the dirt against either of them never truly existed).
Greg was the last one to show up.Suffice to say, the group watched the video (Which turned out to be the rest of the interview just as Mark told Stephanie) and they were even more shocked at the revelation.[i]Well at least she came clean[/i], Greg saidThe rest of the group didn't agree.[i]I wonder just how many more skeletons she's hiding in her closet that she doesn't want anyone to know about[/i], Stephanie curiously says[i]Well Steph...You're the one with the resources[/i], Michelle says [i]Put your investigative talents to work and do some digging of your own.
That's what you're good at.[/i], Michelle continued.
[i]Who knows, you might even show that Mark Girardeaux a thing or two - As if you haven't already.[/i], she adds.Stephanie smiles at the idea of that.[i]Well that all fine great and dandy, but in the meantime, what the fuck do we do about this video?[/i], Brad asks[i]I say we don't tell her[/i], Rob responds[i]Ohh come on man.
THIS VIDEO IS GOING TO BE ON THE 10:00 PM NEWS TONIGHT.[/i], Brad exclaims[i]Heh - A newscast on a station which, BY YOUR OWN ADMISSION Brad, Stacy can't even stand MUCH LESS will care about watching.[/i]Rob responds in a near chuckle at the beginning and in a manner that doesn't tell him anything new.[i]Well I for one am not about to sit idly by and watch my sister's plate get any fuller that what it already is.
She just got through dealing with what's-her-name who wanted to get her hands into Leo's estate.
THE LAST thing she needs at this point is THIS.
Not when Trish could all the Rocks of Gibraltar she can get right now.[/i], Greg said.[i]Well fine.
I say we tell her.
If Trish needs a female Rock of Gibraltar, that's what Marcie is there for.
If there's ONE thing Stacy DOES NOT need to do is get caught up in, that would be someone else's problems.[/i], Brad responds.[i]But Brad, don't you see, THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT SHE NEEDS.
She needs some involvement in things which don't include her, yet things in which she can still be of some help.[/i], Greg responds[i]Steph, you've been pretty quiet on this.
Care to add anything?[/i], Brad asks[i]Not particularly[/i], Stephanie says
[i]Because I know either way, this is going to DEVASTATE her.[/i], she continues [i]Look folks, the simple fact of the matter is this - WE NEED TO REACH A DECISION HERE.
Are we going to tell her about this video or not?[/i], Michelle responds, breaking in, trying to end the debate on the issue. [i]I personally don't care either way[/i], she continues.[i]I say no, mainly for many of the same reasons Greg pointed out[/i], Rob responds.Michelle whips out a notepad.[i]Fine.
I'll put you down as a "no"[/i], Michelle says to Rob as she begins the task of keeping count of the votes.[i]Greg?[/i], Michelle calls out.[i]No.[/i], Greg responds[i]Brad?[/i], Michelle calls out as she marks down Greg's "no" vote.[i]ABSOLUTELY YES![/i], Brad emphatically responds.Michelle marks down Brad's vote.[i]Steph?[/i], Michelle calls out.[i]I may as well vote "no" too because I know that either way, Stacy's going to be devastated when she sees this.[/i], Stephanie says.Michelle records Stephanie's "no" vote on her notepad.[i]Well guys, three "no" votes to one "yes" vote.[/i], Michelle says
[i]Looks like the "no's" have it.
I just hope we can live with ourselves[/i], she continues[i]You know you CAN lock the vote with your own[/i], Greg responds.[i]I know I can.[/i], Michelle says
[i]But to be honest, I'm split right down the middle on this.
Half of me says tell her while the other half of me says *don't* tell her.[/i], she continues
[i]So given that, I'll just go with the majority - And hope & pray this doesn't come back to bite me in the ass.[/i], she adds.[b]MORE LATER....[/b]

Brad/Stacy/Leo/Cassandra/Debbie Storyline
Producer's Note: This is the first - And hopefully last - storyline update.Whenever these updates occur, they will be a synopsis of storylines inan effort to bring the number of episodes current with real time.In addition, they will also bring each of the storylines current as well.Think of them as a filling in of the gaps as it were. This updatewill go back to October 2004 and will cover the following three years tothe present.That said though, it is my goal to see to it that the updates are few and far between in lieu ofactual episodes. As such, updates will only be used whenever therehas been no episode posted within 3 weeks of the date of the previous episode.This will also help the bringing about of new ideas and plot twists, etc.in a more timely manner and keep from taking up several episodes just forone day in real time. The update will be posted after the episodein the works is posted. If in the event no episode is in the works,an update will be posted in lieu of an actual episode in order to keepthings fresh while an episode is being prepared.Updates will also be used during times in which I will have to take a leave of absence from writingthe show for an extended period of time. They will be posted either before or after the absence at my discretion.One final footnote, there are references to episodes which don't actually exist. That is becauseI have no desire to create episodes for what should've been old storylines by now. However, these references are only done for the exceprting of specific scenes.With all that out of the way, here's the update on the Brad Martin/Stacy McFadden/Leo McFadden storyline you've all been waiting for.....2004As already posted in an early episode, Leo gets his deployment orders. In late November, he actually lands in Iraq. Shortly upon arrival, he picks up with his JohnnyAppleseed-like ways when he's not on patrol rescuing people. Meanwhileback in Cedarville, Stacy lets Leo sweet talk her into believing that sheis his one and only even though he knows nothing could be further fromthe truth. Meanwhile, with Leo gone, Stacy rekindles her flame withBrad, which has been kind of an off and on thing.During his deployment, Cassandra Whitmore makes her prescence known. In December, Leo waskidnapped and ultimately killed. Three days after the killing, Stacy is told of Leo's death by military officers at her home. She is devasted by the news. After the officers leave, the phone rings. Stacyanswers it. Brad is on the other end. He senses Stacy received some bad news. He asks her what it was. After several minutes, he manages to get her to break down and tell him. Once she does,he is taken aback by the news and asks her if it was true. She tells him that not only was it true, but the two officers from Fort Cedar who broke the news to her had just left some five minutes before he had called.He tells her he'll be over in a few minutes and immediately hangs up.As minutes turn to hours and hours turn to days, the rest of Cedarville (Except Jennifer Blanton,who has her own issues to deal with) is told of the news of Leo's death. With Stacy in shock over the news, Trish tries to get her through Christmas by trying (albeit feebly) to get her involved with the annual Christmas Party for Cedarville's needy, which Michelle Monroe generously hosts every year at The FonDuLac Hotel in the Grand Ballroom. She tried this in an effort to get Stacy's mind off of Leo's death.Several days after everyone is told of Leo's death, Leo's body arrives at Fort Cedar. The Mayorof Cedarville decides to give Leo a state funeral comparable to that of President John F. Kennedy (He's known to do this whenever someone from Fort Cedar or Cedarville is killed while serving in the Middle East).
After the funeral, Stacy & the McFadden family have their own private burial service, after which Leo is put to rest in military fashion. This occured on New Year's Eve.20052005 starts out with Stacy still coping with the loss of Leo. Meanwhile Brad has been dealingwith issues of his own. With Jennifer recovering from amnesia, David, Marcie & Stephanie are working with Jennifer to regaining her memory. Eventually it boils down to Brad being forced into the fray since it was
Brad whom she saw last before her accident. After some persuading from Marcie & Stephanie, Brad reluictantly joins them. Brad & Jennifer first start out with some small talk, but then as time goes on and as her memory starts to return, Jennifer starts to piece everything together. Brad eventually catches on to this as he detects that Jennifer is trying to win him over again. The two eventually decide that it's best for both of them if they simply split up.Meanwhile, back to Stacy. By summer, Stacy eventually begins to come around and ultimately realizes that life must go on. To back this up, she becomes more involved in the support group which she had been a member of since shortly after the year began. However, her troubles are far from over as Cassandra Whitmore eventually hires an attorrney named Stanley A. Finch. A few days later, Cassandra is told that she has a case of possibly being able to collect from Leo's estate (Which Stacy is the legal trustee of) DESPITE the manner in which she managed to obtain a sample of his DNA (She stole it from a medical lab on base where she allegedly (albeit allegedly) Leo conceived a baby while on deployment duty in Iraq while Leo was stateside. That baby is none other than her son Christopher Whitmore, whom she proudly showed off during her visit to Stacy's house.Cassandra arrived in Cedarville shortly after receiving clearance to travel by her doctor in the wake of her giving birth just a few weeks earlier).A few days later, Stanley files papers with the civilian family courts, who then serve a copy toStacy. Understandably furious over the matter - And at the urgency of her half-brother Greg - She hires Mitchell Claymore to represent her in the matter. A few days after this, she comes face to face with Cassandra in a court of law for the first time. Here's an outtake from Episode 36 dated June 25, 2005....EPISODE 36 - SCENE FOUR - Cedarville District Court - Family Court DivisionStacy & Cassandra have both arrived at the courthouse. With Stacy are Brad & Trishas well as her attorney Mitchell Claymore and her half-brother Greg McFadden.With Cassandra are her son Christopher and her attorney Stanley Finch.Brad & Trish decide to find seats in the courtroom and the two attorneysdecide to meet with the judge in chambers before the hearing to discusssome legal issues. This leaves the two of them alone. As wepick up the scene now, the two of them are seen just looking at each other.Cassandra looking like a mother who, as she once put it, just simply wantswhat's right for Christopher while Stacy looking at Cassandra VERYsuspiciously with an eyes-down look as if she thinks Cassandra is littlemore than a golddigger whom she can't wait to squash like a bug.Beyond that, the tension between the two of them is so thick, you can easilycut it with a dull knife.STACY (Finally breaking the silence between the two) - So you're the fuckin whore who's tryingto come after my ex-husband's estate, eh?CASSANDRA (Defending herself from Stacy's accusations) - I only want what's best for my son - And Leo's.STACY (Still looking at Cassandra with the aforementioned eyes-down look) - Right. Do you reallyexpect me to believe that?CASSANDRA - I don't care what you believe.STACY (Now letting her fury against Cassandra show) - You're nothing more than a fuckin' golddigger.And to think you brought your baby here? What kind of mother are you?CASSANDRA (Showing just how much of a mother she is) - Please watch your language around my son.If he were your son and you were in my shoes, you wouldn't want me foaming at the mouth in front of him, now would you?STACY (Now nose-to-nose and toe-to-toe with Cassandra with a "Go-To-Hell" look on her face) - Wellthat's exactly why I didn't bring my daughter with me. She is THE ONLY child in which Leo is the father of.CASSANDRA - Really? My I can see you are in for a rude awakening, aren't you?STACY (Wondering what Cassandra could be talking about) - Just what the fuck are you talking about? Not that you would probably know anyway....CASSANDRA (Wondering just how dumb & clueless Stacy really is) - Do you think I'm THE ONLY woman Leo has fucked? You don't even know the man you so proudly & courageously call your "husband"STACY - Well since you apparently know him so fuckin' well, suppose you educate me then.....CASSANDRA - Ohh that will be no problem at all.STACY (Sarcastic) - Yeah right. I'll believe that when pigs grow wings and fly.CASSANDRA - Well they have grown wings and they are flying. You just don't see it yet.STACY (Still looking at Cassandra with the very same aforementioned eyes-down look, only morecynical than ever) - No because what I see is nothing more than a fuckin' golddigger. A golddigger I will take great joy in squashing like a bug.CASSANDRA - Once again I reiterate....Please watch your language around my son. If he wereyour son and you were in my shoes, you wouldn't want me foaming at the mouth in front of him, now would you? If you can't do anything else, then please respect this very reasonable request.STACY (Referring to Christopher) - Alright. But I won't do it for you. I'll do it for your son. Why? I just feel sorry for him.CASSANDRA - Why? You have a funny way of showing it.STACY - Because he has you for a mother. Fuckin' slut.CASSANDRA - You know, I've had just about enough of your foaming at the mouth. I think I'llgo find my seat in the courtroom.Cassandra points in the direction of the ladies restroom, which she passed en route to the courtroomCASSANDRA (Continuing as she points in the direction of the ladies restroom) - By the way....Theladies restroom is that way. You may want to take the time to wash your mouth out - With soap - Before going into the courtroom yourself. You need it.Cassandra departs for the courtroom. As she does so, Stacy gives Cassandra the fingerSTACY (To herself as she's still holding up the finger) - I'll decide where I want to go, fuckin'bitch. I don't need you telling me what to do or where to go.Meanwhile, the two attorneys tried to see the judge, but were turned away by his staff. Stanleydecides to present his issue in open court and instructs the staff to inform the judge to that affect. They do. Shortly after the hearing is started, the judge then asks to present his issue, which is a motion to allow the stolen DNA sample into evidence, stating that despite how it was obtained, it was crucial to get to the bottom of the issue as towhether Leo is Christopher's father or not by saying that it might help. When asked how it was obtained, Stanley admitted it was through "questionable means".To no one's surprise, this drew an objection from Mitchell. He had known that Stanley wantedto present something but not something like that. The judge directed both attorneys to his chambers. In chambers, the judge humored himself by having Stanley explain why he should allow it to be admitted into evidence, but all Stanley did was simply reiterate that it might help determine who Christopher's father really is. Mitchell wondered ifHis Honor was seriously considering Stanley's "insane" motion. The judge said no. Back in open court, he told Stanley to obtain a sample of Leo's DNA through legal means. Stanley then requested permissionto exhume Leo's body in order to obtain the sample. Again, Mitchell vehemently objected and everyone - Especially Stacy - were shocked at the gall and audacity at Stanley for making such a request (Everyone includingStacy thought Stanley was a shister of a lawyer or something). The judge however denied Stanley's request, stating that there are less extreme ways of getting a sample than that and ordered Stanley to get to work on it.After a few minutes more, the hearing was over and the courtroom emptied out. As Cassandrawas leaving with Christopher, Stacy just looked at her as if to express her sorrow for Christopher having Cassandra for "A poor pathetic excuse" of a mother (She even said those words too in Scene Seven of the above episode) as Episode 36 drew to a close.Stanley's next course of action took him to the military courts, where he filed papers to obtaina DNA sample from Leo's personnel files. Naturally, Stacy was served with papers to this affect. Mitchell said that she didn't need to attend the hearing since he was her representative. She told Mitchell that she was going to be there regardless.Suffice to say, Stacy was. However Cassandra wasn't. This was because she was told by Stanleythat she didn't need to be there. As such, she remained confident that Stanley would get the evidence they needed and decided not to attend. This would prove to be significant as the reason why will be spelled out later.Anyhow, Stanley plead his case to the military courts. At each level, the request was refused,citing everything ranging from privacy issues to the courts simply deciding not to hear the case at all when it appeared on their dockets. After exhausting all avenues in the military courts, Stanley obtained copies of the transcripts of his attempts to obtain the DNA sample via orders from the military courts and filed a motion with the same civilian court to have Leo McFadden's body exhumed for sole purpose of obtaining the DNA sample needed. A hearing on the matter was scheduled for the following week and Stacy was once again served with papers to this affect.The hearing went down like this in a scene from Episode 40 dated July 23, 2005.....EPISODE 40 - SCENE TWO - Cedarville District Court - Family Court Division - The Courtroom Of The Honorable Judge Charles B. Hackett IIIThe hearing is about to get underway. Both Stacy & Cassandra seat themselves on theirrespective sides of the courtroom next to their attorneys without saying a word to each other. As we pick up the scene now, court is about to be called to order.BAILIFF (Hollering in his usual declaratory announcing fashion) - All rise. This court isnow in session. The Honrable Judge Charles B. Hackett III presiding.Judge Hackett enters the courtroom and takes his seat behind the bench.JUDGE HACKETT (Getting down to business) - Be seated. Unless there's any objection, let the record
reflect that all parties in this case are present and accounted for.The room is silent.JUDGE HACKETT (Continuing) - Hearing no objection, it is so ordered.Judge Hackett now turns to Stanley FinchJUDGE HACKETT (Continuing & now addressing Stanley) - Mr. Finch, I am told you have been unable to obtain the DNA sample you have long requested via legitimate means and are renewing your motion to have the body of Mr. Leo McFadden exhumed for the sole purpose of obtaining that sample. Am I correct?STANLEY (Addressing the court & answering Judge Hackett's question) - Yes your honor. You are correct.JUDGE HACKETT - Do you realize what you are asking me to do?STANLEY - Yes your honor, but as you can see from the transcripts we've provided for your review,we have essentially been left with no other alternative.JUDGE HACKETT (Now turning to Mitchell Claymore, who is Stacy's attorney) - I assume you object to this, Mr. Claymore?MITCHELL (Addressing the court & answering Judge Hackett's question) - Vehemently yourhonor.JUDGE HACKETT - Alright. Let's hear your argument Mr. Claymore.MITCHELL - Well first and foremost your honor, the mere thought of exhuming the body of anysoldier is BLASPHEMY in and of itself. Secondly, I don't believe this court has the jurisdiction to order it exhumed. As such, if Mr. Finch really insists on pursuing this case, I would ask that the court surrender custody of this case to the military family court system, which is where it belongs in the first place. If they order Mr. McFadden's body exhumed, then I don't believe there's anything we can use to argue the matter with.Stacy looked up from her seated position at Mitchell began to wonder just whose side he was onSTANLEY.(Before Judge Hackett can get a word in edgewise and before Mitchell can continue with his argument) - Your Honor, if I may interject here, we have prepared papers to be filed with the military family courts, however since the case was first filed here, we felt obligated to file here first before approaching the military courts with the matter.JUDGE HACKETT - Well, far be it for me to step on the toes of the military courts HOWEVERbefore I just simply defer the matter to the military courts, let's take a recess while I do some consultation to see what my options are. As such, we will take a lunch break after which a decision will be made.With that, Judge Hackett declared the court in recess.In Scene Five of Episode 40, Judge Hackett determined that the best place for the case wasthe military family court system and ordered that all transcripts and other materials be transferred to the military family courts. Stanley backed this up by filing papers with the military family courts requesting that Leo McFadden's body be exhumed. Not surprisingly, Stacy was servedwith papers from the military family courts to address the matter.
A hearing on the matter was scheduled for the following week.That hearing went down during Episode 46 dated September 3, 2005. At the hearing, Stanleypresented his motion to the judge in the courtroom. Mitchell once again objected, insisting there have to be less extreme ways of getting to the bottom of the matter. Stanley countered by demonstrating and outlining the number of ways in which he has attempted to obtain a sampleand the number of times he has been turned down in both the military & civilian courts. The judge then asked Mitchell why she shouldn't grant Stanley's motion. Mitchell argued that the mere thought of exhuming the body of a dead soldier is in and of itself blasphemic and immoral even if it's for the benefit of finding out if he's the father of some kid. After arguments were over and after a brief recess, the judge decided to rule in favor of the plaintiff by granting Stanley's motion and ordered Leo's body exhumed.Needless to say, Stacy was not happy, but Mitchell tried to put a positive spin on it by quickly pointing out how this could work out to their advantage by putting an end to thequestion once & for all. Even with that, she still wasn't happy that it was ordered. Cassandra was not at the hearing, but was overjoyed when Stanley phoned her with the good news. He also pointed out that it would take a few days for the body to be exhumed, obtain the DNA sampleand for it to be examined but in the meantime, she needed to submit a sample of Christopher's blood so that it could be compared to Leo's DNA.She immediately brought Christopher into Memorial to have the sample taken.
The sample was then transferred to the hospital in charge of examining Leo's DNA. The doctors completed their report and forwarded a copy of it to the courts 72 hours later. A week after that, a hearingwas scheduled and all parties were served with papers to that affect.That hearing took place during most of Episode 54 dated October 29, 2005. Along with thelawyers were both Stacy & Cassandra as well as Christopher. The judge started out by calling things to order. After that, the hearing went down like this....EPISODE 54 - SCENE THREE - Fort Cedar Judiciary Center - Family Courts Division - Judge Frances L. Merrick's courtroomThe judge has just called things to order. As we pick up the scene now, she is about to reviewthe contents of the report submitted to her by the independent medical facility regarding the paternity of Christopher WhitmoreJUDGE MERRICK - Unless there's any objection, let the record reflect that all parties involved are present and accounted for.Silence briefly reigns throughout the roomJUDGE MERRICK (Continuing) - Hearing nothing, the record will so reflect the presence of all parties involved. That out of the way, I have here a copy of the paternitytest report. Would a Dr. James Carmichael please step up to the witnessstand?Dr. Carmichael stands up and approaches the witness stand. As he does, he is interceptedby a court officer who swears him in. After being sworn in, he then takes his seat on the stand.JUDGE MERRICK (Addressing Dr. Carmichael) - Dr. Carmichael, I will ask you some basic questions regarding the contents of the report after which both Mr. Finch & Mr. Claymore will be given an opportunity to ask questions of you. Do you understand?DR. CARMICHAEL (Answering Judge Merrick's question) - Yes your honor.Judge Merrick then instructs the court staff to furnish Dr. Carmichael with a copy of the paternity test. As they do, both Stanley & Mitchell dig out their copies.JUDGE MERRICK - Dr. Carmichael, you have before you a copy of the paternity test in question, do you not?DR. CARMICHAEL (After quickly reviewing the report) - Yes I do, your honor.JUDGE MERRICK (Referring to his signature at the bottom of the report) - Turning to the bottom ofthe report, is that your signature?DR. CARMICHAEL - Yes it is, your honor.JUDGE MERRICK - So by your submitting oral testimony today coupled with this report complete withyour signature, you attest to the fact that it is a true and accurate accountof the paternity test administered, do you not?DR. CARMICHAEL - Yes your honor. I do.JUDGE MERRICK - Would you please read the part referring to who is Christopher Whitmore's biologicalfather for us please.DR. CARMICHAEL - Sure.
Given all of this, it is the conclusion of this group of medical physiciansthat the biological father of one Christopher Whitmore can be none other than one Lt. Leo McFadden.Stacy tried to look shocked like the rest of the courtroom was but deep down inside, she was havingtrouble doing so. Cassandra meanwhile briefly glanced over at Stacy, but beyond that was all cheers and smiles.JUDGE MERRICK - And what was done to reach this conclusion?DR. CARMICHAEL - We took a blood sample from Lt. McFadden's body and compared it to the sample wereceived from Christopher Whitmore.JUDGE MERRICK - And what were the results of that test?DR. CARMICHAEL - It was a perfect match.Cassandra was having trouble containing her joyous feeling, though Judge Merrick doesn't even see itJUDGE MERRICK - Thank you.
But remain on the stand. Mr. Finch and/or Mr. Claymore may have somequestions for you. Mr Finch....Any questions for this witness?STANLEY - None your honor.JUDGE MERRICK - Mr. Claymore....MITCHELL - Thank you your honor. Dr. Carmichael, just how did you manage to get a bloodsample from a dead man?DR. CARMICHAEL - Blood doesn't die. It simply ages.MITCHELL - And just how were you able to establish paternity based on "Aged blood", Dr. Carmichael?DR. CARMICHAEL - Well...Succinctly put Mr. Claymore....Today's DNA testing capabilities are far morecomplex than they were....say.....five or ten years ago. In fact, there's a new medical wonder in the world of DNA testing coming out everyday.MITCHELL - That's nice to hear Dr. Carmichael, But how does that relate to this case?DR. CARMICHAEL - It relates because of the network of filtering systems which can be employed to determineanything from paternity to who committed a crime. And some of these are all intertwined and interconnected with one another.MTICHELL - I see. And was this the only option available to you and your staff to establishpaternity?Stanley stands up to object and wondering where Stanley is heading with his examination of Dr. CarmichaelSTANLEY - Your Honor, where's he heading with all this?JUDGE MERRICK - I'd like to know the answer to that as well, Mr. Claymore.MITCHELL - I'm getting to that part, your honor.JUDGE MERRICK (Annoyed and stern) - Then GET TO IT, counselor...MITCHELL - Yes your honor.
Does the witness get to answer my previous question?JUDGE MERRICK (Frustrated) - Yes.Judge Merrick instructs the court reporter to read Mitchell's last question so Dr. Carmichael cananswer itDR. CARMICHAEL - To answer your question, yes it was.MITCHELL - Why was this?DR. CARMICHAEL - Because the body had decayed so much that we determined that the only usable DNAthere was left was blood. And, as I indicated before, it was aged.MITCHELL - So, let me if I have this straight. You and your staff examined the body for usableDNA & determined that the only usable DNA there was left was aged blood. Correct?STANLEY (Objecting to the neccessity of the question) - Your Honor...JUDGE MERRICK - Overruled.
The witness will answer.DR. CARMICHAEL - That is correct.MITCHELL - As such, you took a sample of this aged blood, ran it through your redundant network of filteringsystems, compared it to Christopher Whitmore's own blood & came to the conclusion that it was a perfect match. Correct?DR. CARMICHAEL - Again, correct.MITCHELL - And that's why we are here today. Correct?STANLEY (Begging the court for mercy) - YOUR HONOR...JUDGE MERRICK - Mr. Finch, I sympathize with your wanting to speed up these proceedings by movingthings along as I share that same sentiment. Mr. Claymore, the witness will be allowed to answer the question however THIS LINE OF QUESTIONINGIS OVER. Do you understand me - OVER. It has outlived it's usefulness. In other words - Layman's Translation - MOVE ON!!!MITCHELL - Yes your honor.JUDGE MERRICK - Dr. Carmichael, please answer Mr. Claymore's last question.DR. CARMICHAEL - Yes.
That is why we are here today.MITCHELL - Thank you.
I have no further questions.CASSANDRA (Quietly uttering sarcastically to herself and out of earshot of Judge Merrick) - Thank god.Judge Merrick asks once again if Stanley has any questions of Dr. Carmichael. Stanley says no. Dr. Carmichael is excused.Judge Merrick then asks the lawyers if they wish to call their own witnesses. Both indicate they have no witnesses to call and choose to rest their case on the testimony of Dr. Carmichael. Judge Merrick then announces that there would be a lunch break after which a ruling is expected to be issued. Beforethe break, Judge Merrick makes one last call for any final business. There is none and with that, the case is in recess.In Episode 55 dated November 5, 2005, court is back in session. Judge Merrick calls things to order and then announces a ruling has been decided. The sessiongoes down like this....EPISODE 55 - SCENE FOUR - Fort Cedar Judiciary Center - Family Courts Division - Judge Frances L. Merrick's courtroomCourt has just been called to order & Judge Merrick has just ordered everyone to take their seats.
As we pick up the scene now, she has had the record reflect the prescence of all parties involved and is ready to render her decisionJUDGE MERRICK - Having just heard the uncontested, yet very tedious and meticulous testimony of Dr. James Carmichael, it is usually the policy of this court not to question medical science in determining issues such as these beyond the very basic questions I asked of him earlier. Therefore, since modern medicalscience has determined that Lt. Leo McFadden is the father of Christopher Whitmore, then this court shall not dispute it. In short, it is the ruling of this court that Lt. Leo McFadden is indeed the father of Christopher Whitmore. As such, it is the order of this court that the estate of Lt. McFadden, which Stacy McFadden is the legal trustee of, shall pay child support to a trust in Christopher Whitmore's name.Stacy looks disappointed while Cassandra is all smiles and kisses Christopher softlty on the cheekJUDGE MERRICK - However, there's more.Both Stacy & Cassandra are left wondering what else could there be. Meanwhile, to the astonishment of everyone, Military Police enter the courtroomJUDGE MERRICK (Turning rather scornfully towards Cassandra) - Ms. Whitmore, when you took that DNA sample out of that medical lab in Iraq, you committed a felony military offense.
As such, and after an investigation into the matter, it has been brought to the attention of the court that a warrant was issued for your arrest.
This court is obligated to honor and execute that warrant.CASSANDRA (Standing up and pleading with Judge Merrick) - NO!! There has to be some mistake.JUDGE MERRICK - I assure you Ms. Whitmore, there is no mistake.Cassandra remains standing with her mouth hung open as if it were an airport hangar with the tip of her tongue as a runway for flies. Stacy meanwhile quickly glances over at Cassandra and visually gloats.CASSANDRA (Turning to address Stacy) - Ohh you would like to see me get hauled off to jail, wouldn't you? Fuckin' bitch.MITCHELL (Softly spoken in an near-singing fashion, figuring that Judge Merrick is intelligent enough to see what Cassandra's doing without bothering to explain himself) - Your honor...JUDGE MERRICK - Ms. Whitmore - SIT DOWN. Your objection Mr. Claymore is sustained.Cassandra complies with Judge Merrick's order.CASSANDRA - But your honor, I am inactive military. I have a General Discharge.JUDGE MERRICK - Correction Ms. Whitmore. You HAD a General Discharge. The person who signed off on those papers was reprimanded for failure to notice thearrest warrant in your file. As such, you NEVER WERE discharged.
In addition, by stealing that DNA sample, you violated Lt. McFadden's CONSITUTIONALRIGHT TO PRIVACY as well as COMPROMISED DOCTOR/PATIENT CONFIDENTIALITY and a host of other charges stemming from that. Add that to the fact that you were NEVER technically discharged to begin with, you are also being charged with GOING A.W.O.L. from your unit as well.CASSANDRA - But your honorJUDGE MERRICK - Mr. Finch, I would advise you to advise your client to not say another word.STANLEY (To Cassandra) - She's right. Let me take care of this. Okay?
Please?CASSANDRA (Still in shock) - Okay. But just do it. Please.STANLEY (To Judge Merrick) - Uhh...Your Honor, as her lawyer, I would like to see a copy of that warrant.JUDGE MERRICK - I'll do better than that. I'll have one of the MPs here serve you with the original.Judge Merrick directs the MP with the warrant to give it to Stanley, who looks at it rather grim-faced as the MP returns to his post.JUDGE MERRICK (Continuing & wanting to get back to the issue at hand) - As you can see Ms. Whitmore....Given all of this, I have no choice Ms. Whitmore but to remand you to the custody of the Fort Cedar Military Police Division where you shall remain until such time as you can then be transferred to the Fort Cedar Penal Stockade where you will sit as you await court martial.CASSANDRA (Nearly crying at this point) - NO.....NO....NO.....Cassandra looks at Stanley as she begs of him to do somethingCASSANDRA (Continuing) - Stanley....DO SOMETHING Don't just stand there.STANLEY - Cassandra, what DO you expect me to do about this warrant here?
I can't do anything about it. You're just gonna have to rough it for awhile till I can file papers in the right court. I'm sorry, but those are the facts.JUDGE MERRICK - As for your son Ms. Whitmore, he will be turned over to the Fort Cedar Social Services Division who will, as they usually do, work closely with the civilian Social Service agencies in finding a suitable temporay home for him until more permanent arrangements can be made since you obviously won't be able to be a suitable parent to him yourself while in the stockade awaiting court martial. In addition, he will have a legal advocate appointed torepresent him on his behalf. The court will go along with whomever
Social Services retains to represent Christopher as I no need or desire to be nit-picky with regards to that.Cassandra just looks utterly devasted while Stacy on the other hand couldn't much more happier.JUDGE MERRICK (Continuing & feeling relieved of having to break the news to Cassandra) - Now with that dreadful business out of the way as I hate splitting families up like that, is there any other business before this court?STANLEY - Your Honor....I would like it known for the record that we intend to file papers with the appropriate court regarding the warrant against my client.JUDGE MERRICK - Noted.
But it doesn't change the fact that she is under arrest Mr. Finch nor does it change the obligations of this court with regards tothe warrant either.STANLEY - I realize that your honor. Thank you.JUDGE MERRICK - Any other business before this court?Silence briefly reigns throughout the roomJUDGE MERRICK - Hearing none.
This case is adjourned. Will the MPs please take Ms. Whitmore into custody and remove her from the courtoom. Thank you.Judge Merrick then taps the gavel to officially end the hearing. As she does so and before she heads back to chambers, Cassandra leaps from the plaintiff's table and lunges forward towards Judge Merrick. As she does this, Cassandra acts like a Paris Hilton-like spoiled little rich brat and is also verychildish as she uncontrollably swings her body around. But that only results in her getting wrestled to the floor and ultimately handcuffed by the MPs, who are wearing formal, non-combat clothing like all the MPs in the Judiciary Center except for the ones in charge of guarding the entrancesdo. Meanwhile, uniformed MPs are brought in to keep the side of the courtroom where Stacy is at their seats. This is mainly done fortheir safety. However as the plain-clothes MP3s drag Cassandra out of the courtroom, Cassandra has a few choice parting words for Stacy as Cassandra is dragged past her.CASSANDRA (Yelling as she stands in front of Stacy being held on both sides by MPs) - This isn't over you fuckin' bitch. DO YOU HEAR ME - THIS IS NOT OVER.The MPs then finally manage to drag Cassandra out of the courtroom.STACY (Although meant for Casandra if she were still in front of her, she sarcastically says it to herself as Cassandra is dragged from the courtroom) - Yeah right.
See you in your next life. Fuckin' slut.Just then, Marcie Grant, who's been at Stacy's side as the friend she's always been, approaches her.MARCIE (Thinking Stacy may be in need of some comfort) - Hey Sweetie....Don't let her get to you likethat. Don't give her that kind of control.STACY - Ohh not to worry, I'm not. In fact, I haven't felt more empowered in a long time. Let's get the fuck out of here..Meanwhile, another woman whom Stacy has called "friend" has an agenda of her own in this sordid story. Enter Debbie Stevens. She is another one of Leo's manymilitary mistresses with whom he's done it with while away on deployment duties. Only she was the last woman Leo had an affair with beforeCassandra dug her claws into him and fell for him hook, line & sinker.
Although Debbie never did get pregnant as a result of her tryst with Leo, she's always had it in for Cassandra ever since she found out that it was she who "lured" Leo away from her. All this without even knowing that Leo was already a married man. This was the case with every woman Leo was in bed (Or as will be demonstrated later on in Cassandra'scase, wherever else he & Cassandra could find a spot all to themselves) he did it with.Why & how was this possible?
Simple. He NEVER had his wedding ring on his finger when he was "doing it" with the other women. As such, unless he had previously told them that he was married (Which was VERY rare), the women he had affairs with NEVER KNEW HE WAS WAS MARRIED.Anyhow, getting back to Debbie....Debbie has been in contact with her reporter friend-turned-lover Mark Girardeaux from Channel 7. Channel 7 is widely known throughout Cedarville as being THE SLEAZIEST news operation in town. In fact, some think Channel 7 is so sleazy and tabloidish that they make even TheNational Enquirer look like a small-time, low budget freebie cultural weekly newspaper.Her plan? To shed light on Leo for being the two-timer he was when it came to women and to specifically get back at the one woman who stole him from her at a time in which she didn't even know he was married to begin with. That woman being none other than bitter enemy #1 - CASSANDRA WHITMORE.How was she going to carry out her plan you ask? By going on television and telling all INCLUDING coming clean about her own involvement with Leo.In any case, after Stacy told Debbie during a support group meeting about Cassandra being hauled off to jail, Debbie was overjoyed with the news, but didn't want to let on her connection to the case. After the support group meeting was over, she placed a phone call to Mark, who was doing his thing at the station.The conversation went like this in Episode 57 dated November 19, 2005...EPISODE 57 - SCENE EIGHT - Fort Cedar Ladies Auxiliary HallStacy just broke the news about Cassandra's arrest to the whole group shortly upon her arrival at the group's weekly meeting. As we pick up the scene now, the meeting has just finished and most everyone, including Stacy, are in an adjacent room having refreshments. Meanwhile Debbie Stevens comes up withan excuse to momentarily step away while she checks on her messages and such, but what she really has on her mind is something totally different.DEBBIE (To Mark Girardeaux via her cell phone) - Hi sweetie, it's me. Got a minute?MARK (To Debbie via his desk phone in the Channel 7 newsroom) - Yeah, but we'll have to make it quick as I'm just about to go out on an assignment.DEBBIE - Well you've got another one. It's on.,MARK (Knowing what it is when Debbie talks) - Listen sweetie.....DEBBIE (Cutting Mark off before he can get another word in edgewise) - No YOU listen.
You've always wanted to get the dirt on Leo & Cassandra, haven't you?MARK - Well yeah, but....DEBBIE - No buts.
However I will give you a little extra incentive.MARK - I'm listening.
What is it?DEBBIE - Well according to a friend of mine in our little support group I've told you about a few times, it seems as though our little miss good two-shoes "friend" has landed into something of a legal "tiff" with the military.MARK - What kind of legal "tiff" are we talking about?DEBBIE (Bluntly put) - She's under arrest and is currently being held in custody here on Fort Cedar on a host of charges.MARK (Intrigued & raises his eyebrow) - Hmm....DEBBIE (Trying to entice Mark) - Are you smelling a story NOW sweetie?MARK - Sounds juicy.DEBBIE - Meet me at the FonDuLac Restaurant in 15 minutes for the rest of the story.MARK - On my way.DEBBIE - Great. See you then.Debbie flips her cell phone shut and puts it back into her purseDEBBIE (To herself in a devilish tone of voice & referring to Cassandra Whitmore the whole time) - NOW I've got you right where I want you - Fuckin' tramp. By the time I get through with you, even the guys in the stockade will want to do it with you gangbang-style. You're such a fuckin' easy target.
It's little wonder why Leo fell for you. Then again, fortunately for you, he was a fuckin' two-timer anyway. But even that gave you no right to take him away from me - Or Stacy for that matter. At least I'll owe up to taking him away from Stacy. Too bad you're too fuckin' brainless and too much of a fuckin' bimbo to do the same thing.
You make even Paris Hilton & Brittney Spears look like Nancy Reagan & Laura Bush. And the best part of my plan is, unlike Stacy & the legal system, you won't even know what hit you till it's too late. Fuckin' whore..Episode 57 ends with the above scene.There's more on Debbie in the story on her (Which will be in a seperate post)
