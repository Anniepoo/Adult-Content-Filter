Singer Amy Winehouse found deadJason07/23/11
Singer Amy Winehouse has been found dead at her flat.
The 27-year-old was discovered at the property in north London by emergency services at around 3.54pm on Saturday afternoon, according to sources.
It is understood her death is being treated as "unexplained".
The Back To Black artist cancelled all tour dates and engagements last month after a series of erratic public appearances.
She had been troubled by drink and drugs problems throughout her career.
The singer made her last public appearance on Wednesday night when she joined her god daughter Dionne Bromfield on stage at The Roundhouse in Camden. The singer danced with Bromfield and encouraged the audience to buy her album in the impromptu appearance before leaving the stage.
London Ambulance Service said it was called to the flat in Camden Square at 3.54pm. Two ambulance crews arrived at the scene within five minutes and a cycle responder also attended, according to a spokeswoman.
"Sadly the patient had died," she added.
Winehouse joins the notorious "27 Club" of musicians who have died at that age after struggling to cope with fame.
They include Rolling Stone Brian Jones, who drowned in a swimming pool in 1969; guitarist Jimi Hendrix, who choked to death in 1970 after mixing wine with sleeping pills; and singer Janis Joplin, who suffered a suspected heroin overdose the same year. Doors star Jim Morrison, who died of heart failure in 1971, and Nirvana front man Kurt Cobain, who shot himself in 1994, are also members.

Elsa Pataky Why Is She Famous?Jason04/06/11
Well known in her native Spain for dramatic roles on the TV series Al salir de clase, the acclaimed films El arte de morir, Iznogoud and Ninette, and the Mexican television effort Mujeres asesinas, Elsa Pataky first broke into the international mainstream movie arena by wrestling with deadly reptiles in Snakes on a Plane in 2006. Now she’s shifting her career into high gear -- literally -- to wrestle with fast cars and manly men like Vin Diesel, Paul Walker and The Rock in Fast Five.
A multi-magazine cover girl, budding fashionista and endorsement spokesmodel to boot, Elsa Pataky is a firecracker-hot, five-language speaking goddess who has the skills and the beauty to send her into the upper echelon of highly desirable and legitimately-talented actresses. All that, and she’s the wife of a superhero, having recently tied the knot with Chris Hemsworth of Thor fame. Penelope Cruz can start running for cover right about now.
86 SEX APPEAL
Compared to the other enticing babes who have ridden shotgun in the Fast and the Furious franchise -- most notably Jordana Brewster, Michelle Rodriguez and Eva Mendes -- Elsa Pataky is the first to bring a true European slant to the proceedings, and we’re interested for a number of reasons. First, we can’t stop thinking about her Elle Spain cover (December 2009), where she appeared naked but covered in crystals. Then there’s our fondness for the sight of her piercing eyes, delightfully curvy physique and tight-fitting fashions -- which have often come off in revealing magazine cover shoots for international editions of ELLE, Glamour and GQ. Secondly, her casting in a movie with fast wheels and powerful engines is really no surprise when you consider that some of her thrill-seeking exploits include skydiving and riding on her Ducati Monster. In short, she’s an exotic beauty with a wild side who could easily double as a classy date at a ritzy evening gala or a motorcycling partner on a sunset ride along a coastal highway. Either way, we would be perfectly content.
In the hook-ups department, Elsa Pataky was previously linked to Adrien Brody, one of her co-stars in the horror film Giallo. They didn’t last, but in 2010, she went the distance by marrying Australian hunk Chris Hemsworth, who is better known as Thor in the movie of the same name. Now that she’s married, Elsa Pataky also intends to stay true to her man, having stated that she avoids infidelity by operating under the principle that one can’t love two people simultaneously and should not risk losing the foundation that they’ve already built.
