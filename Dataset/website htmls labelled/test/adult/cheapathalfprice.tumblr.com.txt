Cheap at Half the Price
NSFW and 18+
I'm a pansexual and a bit of a crossdresser. I'm not a sissy and don't like being referred to that way. This is my personal blog, I hope most of the content on here will be my own. Pics, and posts about myself.
Yes, that's me in pics.

after reblogging this i opened up a card my great aunt gave me it has money in it
It could be a complete coincidence but I reblogged this yesterday and toda I fouund $40 at the fruit maket
Eh,why not
#this is dumb#but i’m desperate
when you got nothing you got nothing to lose
I got a job after reblogging this !
I GOT 40$
I GOT $1360! <3<3
I got a free trip to DC!!!! ❤️
ok but for real, shortly after the first time I reblogged this my husband got a promotion and a 6$/hr raise which is just crazy. We literally cried.
Here you go, everyone ~
This is dumb, but I’m desperate ©
#the story of my life
UPDATE: I GOT A PROMOTION AT WORK ARE YOU SERIOUS???
Oh my god I just realized that this worked. I went to deposit a check and found $150
Plz work
OKAY LEMME TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED AFTER I REBLOGGED THIS A FEW DAYS AGO
So as some ofyou guys know my dad died back in December. He had a 2007 Chevy Silverado that he LOVED, but since neither my mom nor I would drive it, she decided to let the bank come and sell it.
Today, she texts me around 3:00 pm with this:
we just got an extra $5,711.64 that neither of us expected.
Yeah, we’re surprised. lol
Well, fuck
Ok
Ok so I reblogged this a few days ago & yesterday I got an email saying that I won scholarship money
Deadass every time I reblogged this I got a new job lol
Ok fine
Here’s hoping the money I’m owed makes its way to my bank account real soon
I can’t not reblog it now
Hey, what the hell right? I need some money, I did play powerball tonight, I’ll keep my fingers crossed.

You know when you see some porn that’s just outside your normal niche and you’re like “I don’t know if I like this it not.”
I think I’m in that area for a lot of people.
I just saw something on my dash that made me think this.

Now I’m trying to decide how I’d react of a real life friend found my blog.
Probably panic right away! Depends on how I found out they knew about it.
Could be interesting if they were ok with it, or even better if they were into it.

This is the thing about @cheapathalfprice ; I always see their pics and think “I wanna start start a friendship with this person.”
…but I can’t stop jerking off. So it gets awkward.
Awkward? For who?
For me :p
It’s only awkward if you try to hide it ;)
