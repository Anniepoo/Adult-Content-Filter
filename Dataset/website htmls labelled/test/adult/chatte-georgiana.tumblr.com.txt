One of the things I appreciate most about ATLA.
irishlad94:
Out of our core cast of 6 characters (Aang, Zuko, Katara, Sokka, Iroh and Toph)  there is no ‘dumb one’   there’s not even really a character who’s even noticeably less intelligent than the others.  Aang is spiritually savvy and philosophically insightful throughout, Zuko is great at thinking on his feet and problem solving (such as solving the doorway to the Sun Warrior Temple , Katara is generally perceptive and well organised good at planning ahead of time, Sokka is a genius of both improvised strategy and fore-planned strategy and good at looking at the bigger picture, Iroh is one of the most genuinely wise characters I’ve ever seen, with every other line being a genuinely useful and insightful bit of advice. and Toph is incredibly shrewd, cunning and good at looking at things purely pragmatically.  this is pretty refreshing because most shows in general, let-alone kid shows feel they need one character to be dumber than the others for comedy or a counterpoint.  even Legend of Korra falls into this trap slightly, with Bolin, who is noticeably less inteligent on a practical level than the other members of the core cast.(don’t get me wrong, i love his character, he’s probably my favourite of LoK’s main four characters)  It’s just cool to see a cast of character who aren’t just all smart, but are to an extent all smart in their own unique ways. Like if you wanted sage advice on what to do with your life? Iroh’s your best bet,  if you needed to plan out a battle strategy? Sokka’s got your back,  If you want to pull off a complex scam or prank, Toph’s probably already done it.

Where there are wolves, there are ravens. Ravens follow wolves around a lot, mostly because they just seem to like them. They aren’t known to follow other predators and they prefer to eat with the wolves instead of alone. Source
wait are you telling me that wolves keep ravens as petscause this is the most goth thing ever since My Immortal
It would be an easier way for the raven’s to get food. And I bet the wolf doesn’t mind the companionship either.
it’s mutualism! Ravens circle ungulate herds and wolf packs, wolves see them, find the animal faster, kill the animal and open up the carcass(which ravens can’t peck through), and then the ravens eat and the nice juicy bits.
oh, and the pet anology is back-assward. ravens play with wolves. and more importantly, wolf pups. you know how animals raised together from a young age are super tolerant of one another? ravens exploit that to get better access to carcasses.
yeah i was gonna say it sounds more like the ravens are keeping the wolves as pets
Ravens, and other crows, are some of the world’s most intelligent animals, passing tests even chimpanzees and some humans fail at. They use tools, they plan ahead, they can think in multiple steps and use their environments to get food. They’ve even been known to fashion tools such as hooks from metal wires and understand water displacement.
Wolves on the other hand are basically large wild dogs.
If anyone’s manipulating and using the other it’s the ravens.
What we can observe: animals coexisting.
What we assume: one animal is manipulating the other, the “smart” animals are taking advantage of the “dumb” ones; likening the ravens to the human role.
What we assumed wrong: that the human role with dogs was anything like the above detached decision to domesticate puppies. Current evidence implies that dogs had a larger role in their own domestication than humans did, and basically moved in with us first. But this doesn’t fit in with the Aryan caveman mythology of a survival-of-the-fittest paleolithic sociopath viewing prey as bags of meat on legs and other creatures as threats or possible resources on legs and women as wombs on legs. This was largely a Victorian reaction to Darwinism and attempt to contextualize a theory which described our own lack of divine specialness through the lens of human exceptionalism we refused to give up. This continues on today in the form of “evolutionary psychology,” which is mostly MRAs talking about how rape is a natural way to pursue one’s biological imperative when sexually frustrated.
What is likely given the limited evidence: neither ravens nor wolves have the power to imprison, control, or discipline the other. The ravens could leave and the wolves couldn’t stop them, and if the wolves didn’t like the ravens they could bite them in half. We have no evidence that this relationship is hierarchical, and no evidence that either would have the power to impose a hierarchy, and ravens brainwashing baby wolves to obey them is a bit more of a stretch than babies being universally adorable and everyone liking to play with them. It might acclimate them to their presence, but that still isn’t a hierarchical relationship, or necessarily a premeditated manipulation rather than something immediately rewarding. It is true that ravens are intelligent, but domination of other beings does not follow naturally from intelligence, and there’s no evidence that other species would see such a thing as rational. A tapeworm uses and manipulates other beings for its own benefit, and does not need intelligence to do it. Therefore intelligence and a parasitic nature can be seen to be two traits which may or may not coexist.
From the limited evidence, it would appear that the wolves and the ravens are friends, and that neither is subordinate to the other. That’s goth AND communist.

You would be surprised with how many people in your life could be going through depression at this very moment.  People hide it like a paper bag over their heads out of fear of being judged, made fun of, seen as weak, or just not taken seriously.  Depression should not be taken lightly, it holds us down from our purpose and potential in life.  Those who tell you that it doesn’t exist have never experienced depression in their life, therefore not understanding the symptoms and how it’s something that cannot be fixed in a day!  So if you think you are depressed or if you think you know someone else who is, please talk to a friend, a family member, or anyone else in your life that you trust - never overlook the possibility of seeing a doctor for more professional help!!  Your feelings are real, your feelings are shared upon millions.  Don’t hide it, talk to someone about it.  With the right help, you can rediscover your confidence and begin life anew with our undying love and support!We are right here!!
I love this..
The timing of this post is impeccable. It always seems to come around when my depression is creeping up on me and it reminds me of my friends who do care about me. Whoever drew this, thank you. Thank you too, solar-citrus.
