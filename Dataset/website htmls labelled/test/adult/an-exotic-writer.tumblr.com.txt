Anonymous:Hey missy. I dont know if you know but there was bomb exploded in jakarta and i live near the place. I was about to go there in exact time the bomb exploded but had to go to the campus instead. Im shaking to death till now. I just want to share hope you have a great week ahead!
i’m so sorry to hear that but i must say that it is fate. fate is shocking sometimes and in your case, it’s like, holy shit. i do appreciate my life and love it to death. i could never ask for better parents and family and friends because i’ve got them. i have a roof over my head and honestly speaking, i feel very blessed and i would never ask to be reborn to be anyone else when i’m this blessed. but there are just days where i ignore all that and tend to hit the stumps. thank you and prayers to the people whose family members were involved.

Anonymous:What about internet slangs? Do you use them? Sometimes I don't understand the malay internet slangs. Especially when they use "xpe". I had to ask my friends what does the x stand for. And they said it stands for "tak". HAHAHAHAHAHA SAVE ME - H Anon
sometimes i do, sometimes i dont! but i do know of malay slangs xD yep! xpe means tak pe. tak is already a short form of ‘tidak’ which means not and 'pe’ is shortened from 'apa’ which means what. so put together is 'tidak apa’ short formed = takpe, internet slang = xpe :p

dmaetrini:(1)I sincerely hope you are doing well my Dear! Your yoongi scenarios get me through the day. And I absolutely love your creativity and style. Thank you always for your amazing work. I hope your day and coming days get better. And remember to breathe
(2) If you fail, never give up! Because F.A.I.L is “First Attempt In Learning!” End is not the E.N.D. It’s “Effort Never Dies!” And N.O is simply wait for the “Next Opportunity!” Wishing nothing but the best for you Dear! YOU DESERVE IT! :3
