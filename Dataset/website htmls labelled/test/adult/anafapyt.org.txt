Snow, Blogger/Bitching, and Memory
Well, we've been snowed in now for days. I just dug out my car and it took me an hour. At least I got two days off of school and work though! Still... I'm about done with winter. Not a big fan of the south but this winter is making me reconsider my relocation choices._______________________Blogger is bound and determined to make me switch to
the "new" blogger.
They will not prevail!
I don't want to have to use my google account for my blog, as I'm trying to keep this anonymous and my google account is my full name. I know I could create a new account but then when I was doing stuff on my laptop at school there's the danger that the other google account might pop up when I was doing something and I'd rather my classmates didn't ask why I have another account. All I want is to keep google and blogger separate, such a hard request?! Anyways... if google prevails in kicking me off old blogger I'll need to switch to another blog server and I'll update with the new URL in my comments.______________________When I'm not digging out my car or in school or at work... I have had a small amount of time for my fantasies and memories... and as it is the day of love (or at least lust)... here we go with the latest memory...He'd had a long weekend at work. Twelve hour shifts and an hour commute each way. By the time he came home, he sat on the couch and fell asleep before he even took his boots off. I couldn't let his weekend be consumed by work... there had to be something worthwhile in there.I walked over to the chair and stroked his cheek, waking him up and he smiled a sleepy apology for falling asleep. I led him into the bedroom and undressed him. He was in his boxers only, and I told him to lay down, he wasn't going to work tonight. He was mine. He did as he was told.He watched me drowsily as I changed into lingerie and walked over to uniform. I knew just what I was looking for. The handcuffs were where they always were. Shiny metal, standard military issue. He smiled and knew where this was headed. I stretched his arms up over his head and handcuffed him to the bedpost.I straddled him and began kissing him slowly. I could feel his cock hardening between my legs as our kisses became deeper, more sensuous. I ran my hands up and down his body, and began to kiss down his stomach. I licked and kissed his nipples, his belly button, down his thighs...Finally I took him into my mouth and and teased him with his tongue until he had a raging hard-on. He was now awake. I worked him in my mouth as massaged his balls. I ran my finger nails lightly up his thighs and over him. He moaned.When I finally moved back up to kiss his mouth again he was begging me to fuck him. I made him watch me strip slowly. Place one nipple then another in his mouth then pull away. I finally let my dripping pussy down on the head of his cock. Just the head. In and out... him begging for me. Then slowly... slowly I took more of him. An inch, two, three... He's bucking his hips and trying to get deeper but I won't let him. I'm in control.Sliding up and down, taking just a bit more of him with every stroke... finally he's buried all the way inside me. I continue the slow progression, but grind into him with each thrust. He's still raising his hips... trying to fuck me but I move with him, I'm not going to let him bully me. I tease him with my words and with my hot cunt.Then its time. I can't wait longer and I begin to fuck him hard. I sit up and bounce up and down on him, moaning loudly as i feel him slamming into me again and again. His eyes are fixed on my bouncing tits and he's struggling against his handcuffs. Sweat is glistening on my skin as I open my legs wider and lean my hands back on his legs, giving him a wonderfully open view of his cock disappearing into me as I fuck him.He tells me he can't wait longer and I tell him to cum. He bucks wildly, causing my own orgasm to wash over me. Finally I collapse onto him. He's still inside me and I lay my head next to his, he kisses my cheek. A lovely end to a hard weekend..

A thought about orgasms
As you know if you've been reading, I've been sex-free since beginning this blog. This means all orgasms have been self-served. Not that they aren't satisfying... but they're just not the same. Why? Same physical reactions, an orgasm is an orgasm... or is it? I had a thought during my morning session today.There's something amazing about allowing someone else to to bring you to orgasm. You're out of control, writhing, and moaning... completely unselfconscious.
To allow someone else to do this to you... to bring you to this point...To be lying there and have them continue to bury themselves deep within you as you cum beneath them... to increase the length and intensity of your orgasm by their movements...Amazing. Unique. Unreproducable by masterbation. Maybe again soon...

Electricity
Isn't it amazing how sensitive we are to touch when we're new to someone? It's almost as if you can feel the distance between you before the first touch. When the first touch happens, even if its innocent... a hand or a shoulder... its as if every nerve in your body is on fire.
It's all you can focus on. You can feel the warmth of their hand, feel every movement. So aware of every graze, every intentional or unintentional touch.The first kiss is the same. So aware. Lips, tongue, hot breath... hands where..? And when its over you can still feel the tingling there. Lingering so you won't forget.I hope its not because I'm young or because I've had only a handful of first kisses. I hope it's always new and exciting and electric.

X marks the spot
We had been fucking in all the usual ways when across the room I spied my computer chair. Nothing fancy, the cheap spinning kind with a padded seat and back, no arms. I told him to go sit in it... he obliged. I saw him sitting there, dick sprung up in the air waiting to see how I wanted him. I considered my options and knew what I wanted. With my back to him and my legs together, I sat carefully down on his lap, slowly. I wanted to enjoy every single inch of him as he filled me. With my legs tightly together like that he felt even bigger than usual. I rested my hands on his legs and began to slowly fuck myself on his dick. Up and down, almost all the way out with each stroke and refusing his pleas to go faster.He put his hands on my waist and decided asking nicely was not his best strategy. He pulled me down onto him hard and began lifting me up and down, bouncing me on his lap. I'd lost control of our pace but I didn't care. He made me ride him hard before stopping suddenly.He closed his legs as he instructed me to put mine on the outside of his. I did as I was told and now had my legs spread, knees just outside of his own. I leveraged my hands on his knees and leaned forward for support as I began fucking him again, his hands still on my waist. We continued like this until he let his hands wander from my waist up to my chest.With both hands on my breasts, squeezing and tweaking my nipples and he pulled me back against him. He told me to fuck him faster and again and again I bounced up and down on his hard dick. The harder he squeezed the harder I let myself fall onto him, feeling him fill me each time.He began to spread his legs then, forcing mine open wider. He spread them until I couldn't any more, and I was completely exposed on top of him. He kept his left hand on my breast as his right moved down to our merging bodies. He reached his hand down to feel his dick disappearing into me as I fucked him, and then moved it up to my clit.He teased at first but he knew what he wanted. He wanted to drive me wild. Still playing with my nipple, he placed his middle finger directly on my exposed clit. He began circling it slowly and steadily, causing me to moan loudly. This spurred him on and he applied more pressure, not letting my clit escape his finger as I bounced up and down. I'm moaning so loud and he tells me I can't cum. Not yet. It's so hard to keep my concentration as I'm stimulated everywhere--hard dick buried deep inside me, fingers pinching my nipple, and one finger directly on my clit. I'm so close to cumming but I hold it back and keep on fucking.Finally I hear his breathing start to speed up and he increases his pressure on both my nipple and clit as he tells me he's about to cum and he wants me to cum with him. He wants to hear me he says. Hear me he did. As he began to come he lost control and began fingering my clit furiously sending me sailing over the edge into my own intense and loud orgasm. We cum for so long,
together, until finally we're both exhausted and satisfied.

The Club
(fantasy)I walk into the darkness. The chill from outside starts to wear off as I'm met with a room full of hot, moving bodies. I shed my coat and move farther into the room. I can feel the music in my chest. Intense, driving beats. The room is full of people but they move as one unit with the music.He grabs my hand and pulls me deep into the thick of the crowd. We find a small spot and begin dancing with each other. It isn't long before I turn with my back to him and he pulls me close. His hands on my hips as we move together and I begin to grind my ass into him. I can feel him grow hard against my ass and his hands move over me. Over my ass, across my hips, sliding up my waist. He grows more bold and moves his hands up over my breasts, squeezing at my nipples. I turn my head and we kiss deeply, tongues probing each other.I turn towards him now and we continue kissing. The bodies around us are a blur and no notices us. He hands are on the small of my back and moving down over my ass, squeezing. My arms are wrapped around him, pulling him close
as I grind into him, loving the feeling of his hardness against me. I move one hand down between us and grasp him, gently stroking up and down as we continue to kiss and move with the music. He pulls back and grabs my hand, leading us to where the crowd meets the wall. He leans me against it and runs one hand up between my bare thighs.My skirt barely covers my ass, just the way he likes it. As his hand moves higher I spread my legs slightly and he discovers that I "forgot" to wear underwear. He smiles and sinks one finger deep into me as he kisses me again. Slowly fucking me with his middle finger as I stroke his hard cock. His body blocks us from most eyes and no one would care if they did see.I unzip his pants and insert my hand through his fly, winding my way through his boxers and finding his smooth, hard cock waiting for me. I pull it out and begin to stroke him more greedily. He moves from one finger to two inside me and we're still lost in our kiss. I pull back just enough to begin kissing and licking his earlobe, gently, as I keep stroking him... and I whisper "Fuck me." It's too loud in the club and he can't hear me, so I say again, louder... "FUCK ME."That's all the encouragement he needs. He pulls his fingers out of me and wraps his hands under my ass, lifting me up as I wrap my legs around him and guide his dick into my hot waiting pussy. I have my hands and legs wrapped tightly around him as he drills me into the wall. Again and again pounding me. I'm holding him so tightly he can move one hand from my up under my shirt. He pulls my bra down and grabs urgently at my nipple. Rolling and twisting it between his fingers sending shooting waves of pleasure directly to my clit.I'm moaning loudly and it doesn't matter. No one hears or cares. I can feel him moving deeply inside of me. My skirt is hiked up around my hips and when I look down I can see him sinking into me again and again. Harder with each thrust. Needing me more. Having to be inside me. I need him inside me too. I want him to keep fucking me. Fucking me harder. Fast and furious now, drilling me into the wall as hard as he can and I begin to cum. It rises slowly and then takes me like a storm. I lose control and and sink my nails deep into his back as I cum hard. My muscles contracting around him spurs him on and it isn't long before he's cumming deep inside me.When we finally separate, I smooth down my skirt and he zips up his pants. We look around and no one has even noticed. He takes my hand and leads me back into the crowd to continue dancing... and I can feel his cum begin dribbling down my thighs...

Memories
Sorry I disappeared again. Apparently this semester is going to be rough!Not feeling too creative so I thought I'd relate some memories of firsts. Some I surprisingly don't remember. I don't remember the first time my first boyfriend fingered me, or the last one for that matter. I don't remember our first dates or much about the first time I had sex. Some I do remember though and I'm struck by how much funnier they are than sexy.First kiss: 16, first boyfriend. After a football game in his friend's basement. I was sitting on the pool table and he was standing in front of my talking to me. He leaned in for the kiss and I had no clue what to do with my tongue or what he was doing with his. He tried to sweep the (pool) balls out of the way to lay me down and they bounced back and hit me, then a story about ecoli came on the news and we both started laughing so hard the moment was pretty much ruined.First head: 16, same guy. Parking lot of a local home improvement store. We had gotten milkshakes and were sitting in my car chatting, and I was licking my milkshake off the straw (I always eat milkshakes by dipping the straw and licking it off... don't know why. I've just always done that). He made some comment about the "seductive" way I was licking the straw and we started kissing. He moved my hand to his pants and he was (of course) very hard. He pulled it out and I kind of half jacked him off for a few minutes. Then I leaned over and took him in my mouth. Didn't know what to do. Just kind of bobbed and licked for all of maybe 3 minutes before he came. I swallowed it and felt sick to my stomach for the rest of the night. I could swear I felt them swimming around in my stomach and I felt TOTALLY guilty when I got home and my mom was still up watching tv. The same guy would later put this as one of his favorite hs memories in our senior yearbook. Carefully guised with initials and euphemisms of course, but all of our friends knew and it got a good chuckle. (for the record I've never spit.. and no it does not make me sick to my stomach anymore!)First sex: 17, last bf. What I remember... it was planned. I know this because I know I bought lingerie and he had booked a hotel room. I don't remember the discussion or how/why we decided it was the right time. It was our 6 month anniversary. I wore a teal baby-doll thing. I know I was nervous. I know it hurt. I know I was SO nervous that I had to get up and pee three times. (sexy eh?). I know I didn't cum, although I think he finished my off orally. I'm not sure about that but I'm sure he got me off... he was a very considerate guy. I'm not sure if he came in me or if I finished him off with head. The next morning he took me to breakfast at Dennys and we ran into a few people from school... it was pretty clear we'd spent the night together. We got some looks but we didn't really care.Odd that I wouldn't remember more isn't it? These are the kinds of things girls are supposed to remember forever. I should really keep a diary. Anyways--sorry it wasn't a bit more sexy or graphic but my sex muse is apparently out for the day... I'll try harder tomorrow. :)

Double the pleasure
(fantasy)Bound. Blindfolded. Helpless. Wrists tied together and handcuffed to the headboard. He's taking his time.I feel his breath on my neck. It's hot but he doesn't yet touch me. I can feel him moving around the bed and my I'm tensed, waiting for his touch. I want to feel his touch so badly but he makes me wait. When he finally breaks the distance it is with the tip of his tongue on my nipple, gentle, teasing--but it sends an electric shock through my body and I moan involuntarily. He moves to the other nipple.. still teasing, then taking it all in his mouth, sucking sensuously.I writhe in my shackles, knowing it will do no good. He withdraws and takes one finger, placing it in my mouth and telling me to suck it, which I do greedily. He withdraws it and drags it from my lips, to my chin, down my neck, between my now heaving breasts, and lower... When he gets to my pubic bone he stops, whispering "not yet." All I can see is darkness but it just makes my other senses feel more alive. The sound of him, the smell of his cologne, his touch...He kisses my neck now as his hand begins to kneed my breast. He rolls my nipple between his fingers and pinches.. enough to sting... just enough. His hand travels farther south and he flicks my clit lightly as he passes it. He runs one finger up and down my slit... up... down... then circling the clit. He kisses me deeply then as he slides one finger deep inside me. Fucking me slowly then curling his finger up to rub my g-spot in the way that makes me drip and moan and need him so badly. Two fingers now and his kisses can't stifle my moan. My hips are writhing now under his touch and I beg him to fuck me.He tells me to turn over and I do with some difficulty. Balancing on my forearms and knees, knees arches, legs spread, he knows what I want. His hands are on my ass, caressing, tracing my curves. I know he must be hard be now and I feel the tip of his hard cock pressed against my ass crack. He slides it deep, deep into me and begins fucking me slowly. I meet each thrust with one of my own, I can't get enough.I feel his hand stroking his cock and balls as he fucks me slowly, fingers playing in the sweet wetness he's fucking. He slides a finger up my ass then to my tight little hole and begins to massage it. I stiffen, we've never done this before. I've never done this before. He tells me to relax and I do, widening my legs for him and enjoying his length sinking deeply into me again and again. He works one finger slowly into my ass as he continues to fuck me and I can begin my muscles begin to relax. He tries two fingers now... it's tight and he has to work slowly. Working them in, fucking me slowly, it feels so good. I can feel him pouring lube down my ass and working it into me. It goes easier now.Then he tells me he has a treat for me. Something I've been wanting. He pulls out then and I know what's coming. His head slides up against my ass. It's too big. He pushes with steady pressure and it slides in, just a little bit. He pumps slowly, shallowly, patient with me. It feels so tight, so different, so taboo... I love it. I tell him to keep going and he does. Working it in inch by inch and it's getting easy now. He's finally able to bury himself completely in my ass and starts pumping slowly in and out, in and out. He picks up the pace and I can feel his balls slapping against my pussy. God it feels good.I'm moaning now and my legs are spread wide open for him.
Still tied. Still helpless,
his for the taking and I love him taking me.
I hear a buzz and I realize he's reached for my vibe. As he fucks me I feel him slide it up my slit and deep inside of me. He turns the base and the vibe is working at full speed. He leaves it there now and grabs my hips.I'm on my knees and forearms. Hands tied. Blindfolded. Legs spread for my lover that is now grasping my hips hard as he fucks my virgin ass for the first time and feels the wonderful vibration emanating from deep inside my pussy. It's too much. I'm moaning uncontrollably and fall onto my face. Begging him to fuck me harder. He obliges and the whole bed is shaking, he's almost pulling me off my knees as he slams into me again and again and again. His balls slap against the base of the vibrator buried all the way inside me. I can't take it. I let go and cum like I've never come before. He cums then too, fucking me even harder as he shoots his load deep inside my ass. When it's all over he collapses on top of me. Both spent. Both satisfied.. with both holes still filled.

When I think about him...
When I think about him, I get excited. Nipples hard, starting to get wet. I want to feel him inside me. I want him to bend me over and take me. I want to feel his hands on me.
Moving from my face, tangled in my hair. Running his fingers up my sides and over my waiting breasts. I want to feel his kiss. Deep. Sensual. Needing me.I want to feel his breath on my neck. I want to feel his tongue on my body. I want to feel his cock, rock hard, sliding deep inside me. Fucking me harder than I think I can take but I do. And I love it. I want to try new things with him. I want him to take my ass. I want him to call me a slut. I want him to push my limits. I want to fuck him on an airplane and a rail car and anywhere else he wants me.I've never felt his touch. Never seen his face. Never heard his voice. At the first word from him, though, I'm ready. Ready to feel him inside me. Needing that...

Porn
I've never been a huge fan of porn. I like it and have watched it with boyfriends, but I don't need it to get myself off and I never took the time to look at it myself. The very few times I had tried to look at it I was met with having to log in or download or some other hoop that I didn't care to jump through. Tonight I was informed about a very cool site, www.tehvid.com. It compiles all the free videos from other sites so you just click on the picture you like and you're taken to another site to watch that video for free with no downloading or sign up. Super fast and easy- awesome! Which made me consider what type of porn I want to watch... and the answer came back as oral.This is a little strange... if you've been reading along you know that getting oral isn't really high on my list, and it never really makes it into my fantasies. Something about seeing it up-close though is so amazingly hot. My favorite videos are those that keep tight on the "pussy shot" while a man or woman eats a woman out. I like when they lick all over the area, and finger fuck with one or two fingers while sucking on the clit. I love watching the hips buck as this is going on. I love watching a woman grab onto a man's hair as he's plunging his tongue deep inside her.
I love seeing her spread herself wide with her fingers so he can plunge even deeper into her. I love being able to see her contract and shake as she cums and he continues licking and sucking her clit mercilessly.Watching these videos makes me really crave it. I would love to just lay back right now and let a man go to work. Spread my legs wide for him and fondle my tits as he licks and probes every fold of wetness. Watch his head only partially visible between my legs, run my fingers through his hair, moan and let him hear how great he's making me feel. Cum hard onto his waiting tongue and into his mouth.... have him sink deeper into me as I try to pull away from the stimulation...God that sounds good right now.p.s. Jake Gyllenhaal is on SNL tonight and I think I'm more excited for this than the porn... he is by far the hottest guy I have seen in my life... the things I would do to him!Enjoy!! (I will!)And as an aside... his sister is hot too. Maybe the hottest brother/sister combo out there... so here's Maggie:

I'm back!
Few days of reprieve coming up... love MLK day :)Here's a fantasy I've been thinking about for a while now...I stand out on the balcony in the fluffy white robe provided by the hotel. Nothing beneath. The wind has a chill and I can feel my nipples grow hard against the soft fabric, I wrap myself more tightly. I'm standing close to the edge now, hands gripping the railing.
The night is clear and the moon is bright, even in the crowded and light polluted city. I look down and see the cars, they look so tiny. He comes out and stands behind me, placing his hands just outside each of mine on the railing, and pressing up against me. We don't speak.He brushes my hair off to one side, off my neck, and kisses me lightly.. intensifying the chill that the wind began. I moan softly in appreciation and he slides one hand around my stomach, pulling me close to him as he continues to kiss my neck. His tongue moves from the back of my neck to the side, and down to the top of my shoulder. He slides the robe down off my shoulders and continues to kiss. I press my ass back against his rapidly hardening package and he slides one hand inside my robe, fondling my breast and squeezing my nipples.My breathing is getting heavier now and I can feel my heart racing. Pinching and squeezing each of my breasts in turn as he kisses my neck, making me wet. He pulls my robe farther down and my arms fall out of the sleeves, it's held up only by the belt still tied around my waist now. He uses both hands fondle me as he presses me against the railing and I'm suddenly aware of my nakedness. A thousand eyes could be watching from the high rises around me and the pedestrians on the street below. As he continues though I forget about the eyes and focus only on his hands.I turn around and kiss him deeply, arms wrapped tightly around him. I pull his shirt up over his head as I turn him so his back is against the railing. Down on my knees now and unzipping his pants, letting them fall to the ground. The boxers come next, but I don't give you time to step out of them so they're stuck around his ankles. He's so hard and I can't wait to get him in my mouth. I start with a few long licks from base to head and sit back as I let the wind cool my saliva on his dick. I take him all in then run my tongue all along the ridge that runs underneath. I lick and suck the head. I bob my head back and forth. I pause just long enough to catch his eye and smile as much as I can with his dick in my mouth... then back to work. I'm getting so wet just having his dick in my mouth I can't stand it.I stand up and kiss him again, shedding the remains of my bathrobe and then working my way with my tongue up his neck to his ear. I whisper the only words that will be spoken between us that night "Fuck me... now." He needs no more encouragement. He turns me around and bends me over the railing before sliding his long hard dick deep inside my waiting wetness. I'm bent over the railing, hands holding onto top for support as he rams himself into me again and again. His hand are next to mine on the railing and he uses it to pull himself into me harder and harder. I can feel the cold metal digging unmercifully into my abdomen and I don't care. My tits are bouncing wildly now and I'm hanging over the railing. Any one of a thousand sets of eyes could see us now and I couldn't care less.All I want is him inside, pounding me, fucking me, taking me without regard. He delivers exactly that. Hard, fast, fantastic. I'm crying out now and I don't care if the other hotel guests can hear. Again and again he pulls himself almost entirely out and then rams his hard cock deep, deep inside me. I can't take it anymore and I come hard and loud. The contractions of my pussy send him over the edge and he cries out as he shoots his load deep inside me. A few more thrusts and its over. We stand still, breathing hard, his dick still in me. Slowly we separate and he turns me around. A long kiss and we retreat back into our room... the night has just begun...

My goodies
Well... kind of. I've never posted pictures of myself on here and I probably won't. I like that whole anonymity thing. :) I did go shopping yesterday, though, and bought myself a few little somethings. I'm addicted to Victoria's Secret. I should buy stock. They were having their semi-annual sale and
I couldn't resist. So, since in my current sex-less state I have no man to show them off to, you all get to see them. Not me in them- sorry, but hey it's something right?This is the only set that I bought. It's the new "patented" VS bra and material- we'll see if it's so revolutionary. Cute though!You can never have too many black bras I think. Especially ones with lace overlays and tie up center. :)These are the new "cheeky" panties. Not thongs, but let your butt cheeks hang out- totally sexy and I'm in love with them.Especially the cute little flower!

To shave, or not to shave.
My vajay-jay that is. (yes, I know it's mostly guys out there reading this, but that reference was for you girls out there! and of course the male closet-Greys fans).Such a hot topic now, the state of grooming of one's nether regions. I don't think I've ever really discussed mine on here. I've run the gammit since I started having sex. I've been "natural" (mostly at the beginning before I knew better), trimmed, closely groomed with "landing strip" or triangle, and bare. It seemed to me when I was younger that guys didn't mind any particular fashion, as long as they were getting some. My ex said that bare was fun sometimes, but preferred an all-over close trim for every day events. As I've begun talking to more guys, it seems now that bare is the standard. When did this happen? Was it always this way and I had no idea? What percentage of women are actually completely bare all the time? I wonder if as time progresses it will become the social norm, as shaving legs and armpits are. At one time, women did not do this and that was normal. Today, women who don't shave them are considered hippies, lesbians, or not getting laid.Shaving takes a lot of time, especially shaving such sensitive areas. With my forever state of late-ness in the morning when I'm getting ready, it's all I can do to shave my legs and armpits, let alone messing with anything else. When I was keeping it bare I'd generally jump in the shower specifically for that purpose several times a week, rather than doing it as part of my daily routine. With an electric trimmer, it takes very little time to maintain a close crop, as I'm currently sporting.So what do I prefer? I don't really care. Sex isn't really better one way or another. Honestly, I think bare looks a little funny. Probably my preference would be completely bare with some type of landing strip at the top. Something to let you know you're not actually fucking a 12 year old girl. But hey- that's just me.So do all guys prefer completely bare? Or just the ones I've been talking to lately. From their point of view, I get the bare thing for oral at least. Guys are a bit more "in it" in regards to oral than women so it makes sense to have it bare, but a bit up top would not inhibit this. Is is their secret desire to fuck young girls? Or just a tactile thing where they look smoothness? Hard to say. How much do guys care about this? Is it just a preference? Or is it important?So what will I do for the next guy? I'm not sure. Probably go bare. Seems to be the safest bet because I've never heard of a guy disliking bare. I kind of just wish I had the cash to get bimonthly brazillians so I could be done with it and not have to do anything myself. That won't be for a few years yet though--so I guess I better friendly up to the razor because we'll be pals for a while yet.p.s. brief (and uncommon) feminist rant for a moment. I don't really consider myself a feminist and I'm not usually one to bitch about disparities in social norms... but sometimes when I'm getting ready to go out or for sex it makes ya think. Think about a man's getting ready vs. a woman's getting ready.Man: Shower, shave face, maybe trim nether region, aftershave, deoderant, clothes, cologne- done.Woman: Shower, exfoliate, cream rinse hair, shave legs, shave pussy, shave armpits,
face mask of some sort, pluck eyebrows,
lotion,
deoderant, makeup,
hair products and blowdrying,
try on 5
outfits to find one that makes your ass and tits look big enough and your waist look small enough, perfume, 3-4 inch heels- (2 hrs later) done. And it's all for you guys. And you rarely notice unless we miss a step.

Two in one day??
That's right folks, just cause I love ya. ;)I've had some questions about what type of d/s stuff I've actually done and how that whole thing works for me. I thought I'd write a post about sex with the ex. This isn't any one session that is stuck out in my mind, but kind of a description of the way a pretty typical fuck would go when we incorporated d/s.
Enjoy!Do you want me? he asks... I'm laying on my back naked, he is kneeling over me slowly stroking his hard cock and grinning. I nod as I bite my lip and can't take my eyes off his hand moving up and down... I want his cock in me so bad and it's such a tease to not let me have it. Too bad. I don't think you deserve it yet. What will you do for it? I think... what is the best answer? I just want it now! Anything!! I say as he looks thoughtful.Hold your tits together. And I do. He leans over me and puts his hard dick between them, fucking them and looking down at me. I catch the head of him each time he thrusts, and with each thrust he is harder. Finally he moves up so that when I catch the head he thrusts his whole cock into my mouth, telling me to suck it. I do greedily, swirling my tongue along the ridge under the head and reaching up to rub his balls. He fucks my face for a few minutes before deciding that I've earned my reward.He tells me to spread my legs for him. No, he says, wider. I'm still laying, now with spread legs waiting. He reaches down to rub my clit and then thrusts two fingers into me hard without warning. You're wet, what do you like that? He teases me and I nod again. He teases my clit with his cock, and slides it into me in one fluid motion. I take him all and moan... loving how full he makes me. He places one hand over my mouth to muffle me as he begins to pick up his pace. He fucks me harder, pressing his hand down harder on my mouth so almost no sound escapes, and I love it.He pulls out suddenly and tells me to turn over and spread my legs wide. I always do as I'm told. I'm on all fours and he begins fucking me roughly from behind. He tells me to put my face into the mattress and I do, as he grabs my hips so hard that I can feel bruises forming. He grabs my hair and pulls it hard to one side so that he can see my face as he fucks me roughly. He releases my hair and slaps my ass hard... I can feel blood rushing to the surface. Again he slaps me and it makes me buck back against him... with each stinging blow I want him more...I'm on my back again now and he's looming over me. This time he tells me to put my wrists above my head. I do and he handcuffs them around one of the posts on my bed. My arms are stretched up so that I can't move them at all, and he is inside me again. He puts his hands under my ass and lifts it up so that my legs are wrapping around his chest and he's fucking me deep. He leans forward and one hand finds its way around my neck. He squeezes, not hard at first, just enough to let me know that I have lost all control. He controls me now, he can fuck me or leave me, do anything he wants and I couldn't possibly stop him. Then harder. It's hard to breath and he looks into my eyes... seeing my excitement growing and feeling my wetness dripping all around him. Do you want me to stop? he asks and I nod my head yes as best as I can--I don't want him to, but I want him to disregard my plea. I know he knows this and he squeezes harder.I'm breathing hard now and he releases me before I begin to lose consciousness. His hands roam over my body as I'm pinned.... arms tied and his weight on top of me. He pinches my nipples and plays with my clit as he fucks me. When my breathing returns to normal, he moves his hand back up to my throat and squeezes just hard enough to making talking difficult. He begins pounding into me with such force that it's hard to keep my legs around him. I can already feel my orgasm growing but I want to wait... I just want to experience him.This time he leans close enough to look me in the eyes and whisper to me... Do you want me to stop? I answer yes. Too bad. and he fucks me harder. please, I say... stop... don't... I get the words out knowing that he won't stop (and that I don't want him to). You feel that hard cock fucking you? You're going to take it all and you're going to like it. he tells me. I don't care if you want me to stop. What are you going to do? I'm going to fuck you until I cum and there's not a damn thing you can do about it. I struggle against my handcuffs enough to give him reason to punish me... fuck me harder and continue to tell me I can't make him stop. Take it, he says again as he fucks me. I love it I want him to use me to get off. The harder he holds me the hotter I get and with every word he speaks I want him more. I cum hard and loud as he fucks me and when its all over I'm left exhausted... bruised hips and wrists... and maybe collar bone. After we've both come he pulls out and flops down beside me, releasing me from my handcuffs. He smiles at me and I smile back, he kisses me on the nose, gently, as he wraps his arms around me and we fall asleep.

Your O face..
10 points for anyone that gets the reference... :)So I came across a really interesting website: http://www.beautifulagony.com .
The website invites people to send in videos of themselves during orgasm. All of the videos are from the shoulders up only (with sound), and you don't know what is going on below the frame. There's no real nudity, just naked emotion. It's really interesting to watch people as the come. It runs on a membership basis, but they have a few free samples.This website amazes me. Who are these people? So sexually free that they put video feed of themselves in their most intimate moment online for the world to see. I run a sex blog so carefully anonymous because I'm afraid of anyone recognizing me--these people just put it out there! I completely respect that. I wish sex was so appreciated in our culture that I could be unafraid to put a video of my orgasm online.Regarding orgasms though... they're not really objectively attractive. One of my favorite movie lines comes from Dogma about God having a great sense of humor... referring to the faces humans make during sex. It's so true! Luckily in the moment I'm a bit too caught up to care what faces I'm making... but I'm sure they're funny. There is something very intimate about allowing someone to see this... maybe this is (one of the many) reasons doggie style is so great, we feel like we get let go a little bit more because we're not face to face. I have in the past, in a more intimate session, made an effort to stay eye-to-eye with my lover, hands holding his head close to mine,
and ask him to watch me as I come... this took a long time for me to feel comfortable doing though. Odd that I'm more okay with getting fucked than watched closely as it's happening!In any event... I've now rounded the three month mark for lack of sex and I'm hoping the new year will bring me lots of opportunities to look ridiculous as some man is making me orgasm again and again and again and.... :)

New Years Resolutions
Seems like the way to start off the new year right? I'll do both my normal and sexual resolutions :)General resolutions:1) Be healthier- more veggies, more water, less diet soda. Maybe even some running.2) Get out more. I'll admit it, I'm a bit of a homebody. I don't like bars or clubs, I'd rather be home watching a movie or drinking with a few close friends. But the world is good, I should get out more!3) Find a guy that treats me as well as I treat him.4) Not lose myself when I find that guy and become a pod couple-dom person.Sexual resolutions:1) Have more sex.2) Have sex in every country I enter (I'm traveling abroad in a few months).3) Find a guy that pushes my limits4) Get spanked5) Try anal play

Super-quick post
Just arrived back at my home after my 2+ week stay at my parents' place. About to hop in the shower because I'm headed out for the holiday.Had to write a quick post though to say HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! to anyone who might read... and to inform all that my toy and I had a joyous (if quick) reunion. I left him here due to a significant lack of privacy at my
parents' place.... and I thought of him often. I had barely gotten all my things out of the car before I was racing upstairs to give him a proper hello. :)

I'm back!!!
Holidays were hectic and I was having computer issues so no posting for
a bit... but I'm back now! I wish I had a few weeks of great sex to report, but unfortunately that's not the case. Had a pretty dry few weeks until a few days ago. Drove a few hours away to stay with my friend (the one from the first few posts) for a few days and had a really great time. Just hanging out was great, and of course we ended up semi-hooking up again.Before I'm called a tease let me reiterate that I think sex w/ him would be a bad idea and I told him that absolutely nothing was going to happen from the start and frequently and he said that was fine.. so the first night we just made out and he got my shirt off. He's pretty skilled with his hands/mouth... he even pulled out the ice cubes for a bit of chilly fun. lolSecond night we started a bit early with the making out and he kept pulling me on top of him or getting on top of me. We made out and grinded for a while, and eventually I just wanted to go further. I still thought sex was a bad idea but I pulled him up so he was straddling my stomach and pulled his pants down and let him tit fuck me. After a minute I took his shirt off, he pulled off his pants, and I told him to go sit in his computer chair. I crawled off the bed and onto the floor, and knelt between his legs. I sucked him off with him watching me. He was shaved which I'd never experienced on a guy before and I kind of liked. I more fun licking and sucking on his balls without worrying about getting hair in my mouth. It was kind of weird looking up and realizing I was doing this to my best friend, but I was having fun.Now things are just a little strange. We joked around about it and we're totally cool... but we just talk too much haha. It's weird to (semi) hook up with someone that has no problem saying anything at all to you. He didn't actually have anything bad to say at all... but still weird to have a guy describe your boobs in comparison to all the other girls he's hooked up with haha. But I do the same for him so I guess turnabout is fair play :)So basically... little play, no sex... relatively dry break. Hopefully the new year will bring me lots sex, and I wish the same for you!

Real life sucks.
So, in my real life I'm quite busy with finals and have no time for fun sex stories. My appoligies. I did find time during a study break to take this test sent to my by a classmate though: www.puritytest.netMy score was 55.6%, which is pretty damn low considering I answered yes to only one of the drug questions. I'm not sure if that's good or bad... haha.What's your score?

When the lights go out
One quick turn of the knob and my new toy whirls to life. I'm under my covers in panties and a tank top, and the plastic is cold to the touch. I pull the top of my shirt down, exposing my breasts to the chilly air and my nipples are suddenly hard. I move the toy to my left nipple first, then the right. The vibration feels good on them, making them even harder and I can feel myself growing wet.
I tease my nipples with the tip of the vibe for a moment before replacing it with my hand and moving the vibe down to my panties.Over the panties first. Lightly. I move it gently over my clit, and farther south. Very lightly. Just teasing. The vibration is driving me crazy and making me drip. I pull my panties off and slide the tip against my clit. There's a shudder through my body. I hold it there for a moment as I pinch and rub my nipples. I make slow, steady circles around my clit, already shaking and aching for more.I slide the vibe down into my waiting wetness. No resistance. I can feel the bulbous head of it inside me, and my whole body is alive. I begin fucking myself with it slowly. I turn up the vibration. I'm on my back, feet flat on the bed and my legs spread. I'm rubbing my breasts and sliding the vibe in and out, now harder. It feels amazing and I'm so wet that I can hear every thrust.Faster. Harder. My breathing is ragged. My eyes are closed and it's not my vibe fucking me its a big hard cock. I can feel it thrust into me, deep, I move faster. I want more. Harder. I move my hand from my breast downwards... One hand working the toy fucking me hard and the other circling my clit. I can't take much more. I begin feeling that familiar tingling sensation and I keep going. Moving the vibe hard and fast now, feeling the vibration echoing through me and rubbing myself. As I cum hard I thrust the vibe into me and turn it higher, continuing to rub my clit. I feel my muscles tensing tightly around the toy, spasming, rolling through my body. A few more thrusts and it's over... and I can breath... satisfied, if only for a moment.

Mile high
(fantasy)I take my seat in the large plane and wait. Nervously. I look down, black boots. Three inch heels and black leather that zips up to my knees. Black thigh-high stockings attached to garters under my grey skirt. Red top hiding my black lace bra. Not the most comfortable outfit for travel, but I want to look good for him. I look towards the front of the plane, where is he? I look out the window and I'm lost in thought. Thinking of him...And then he's there. Sliding into the seat next to me, grinning as he sees my outfit. I smile back. We make polite small chat through the remainder of boarding and instructions. As the plane taxis down the runway then begins its assent my heart is beating faster. I'm not sure if it's anxiety about flying or about him next to me. I suspect the latter. He notices me grasp the seat arms as we take off and he grabs my hand. I'm suddenly much more calm.We survive the the take-off and get the okay to remove seatbelts. His hand moves from my hand to my leg as we chat. Sitting there innocently then slowly sliding towards the inside of my thigh. Such a small thing but it's all I can focus on. I want him to move it further. To take me right there. Too many people around. I take my hand and slide it up his leg. His conversation falters as he looks down and grins. I continue up and can feel that he's already hard. "Already? I've barely touched you!" I tease. He doesn't respond, but pulls his head to me and kisses me hard. Our first kiss but it doesn't feel that way. Feels like we've been doing it forever. "Meet me in two minutes" I say with a coy grin and move over him, up the aisle and into the bathroom.I use my time to look in the mirror, fix my hair, straighten my skirt. It doesn't take him long before he slides into the cramped space with me. He can barely fit in the tiny space and we giggle as we try to get the door closed and face each other. His hands are buried in my hair as he kisses me passionately again. My arms are around him, sliding down his back, and onto his ass. I pull him into me, feeling his hardness pressed against me. A small moan escapes my lips and he kisses me harder. His hands slide down to my waist and he picks me up, placing me on the sink behind me. I spread my legs so he can stand between them and continue our embrace.His hands are under my shirt and I'm unbuckling his belt. We know we have to be quick so as not to arouse suspicion. I release him from his pants and begin to stroke him as he moves down to lick my nipples. I want him so bad. I wrap my legs around him and pull him close to me. "Fuck me" I whisper in his ear and he looks surprised by my bluntness. I'm a girl that knows what I want. And I want him. Now.He pulls my ass to the edge of the sink, reaches into my wetness to move my panties aside and enters me. My legs are wrapped around him tightly as we try to maneuver without making too much noise. His hands are feeling my legs around him and sliding up to feel my garters under my skirt. My nails are digging in his back and I'm kissing him hard to try to stifle my moans. We've thought about this for so long that our time constraint will not be a problem. I push him back and slide off the counter. I turn around, bent over the counter with my hands resting on the back of the sink. He pulls my skirt up over my ass and enters me from behind, fucking me hard. It's harder to stay quiet but we can't really care.I can see him in the mirror, behind me, watching my ass until he sees me in the mirror and smiles. He holds me by my hip with one hand for leverage and reaches his other hand around and finds my clit. It's too much and I don't care about the noise. I move my ass back to meet his every thrust. He rubs my clit harder and pushes me over the edge. I cry out and he fucks me harder. He moves his hand from my clit to hold both my hips and thrusts himself into me again and again and again until he cum hard.He slides out of me and I pull down my skirt. He zips up his pants and I giggle. He leaves first to return to his seat and I smooth my clothing. As I walk back to my seat I feel eyes on me... they all heard. And I don't care. It was a great first meeting.

His slut
I've dabbled in submission but it never seemed like enough. I always wanted more... a partner that truly loved to dominate me..."Do you want me?" he asks. "yes" is my quick response. "Yes?" he asks, displeased, "Yes WHAT?". "yes, sir?" i respond. "Of course you do. I don't care. Get on your knees and suck my cock." I drop to my knees and go to work on his hard cock. He instructs me on every move, his hands on my head guiding me. He tells me when to lick and when to suck. How to lick his balls. "You like that don't you?" he asks. "yes, sir." I respond. "Did I tell you that you could stop?" he asks as he slaps my cheek. I move quickly back to sucking his cock, swirling my tongue around it... he has my hair hard and begins forcing it deeper and deeper into my mouth and throat. He becomes rough and I don't dare resist as he fucks my mouth.He pulls my hair hard upwards, forcing me to stand. He instructs me to spread my legs. I stand with my feet shoulder width apart. Wider he tells me, and I obey. He reaches out and pinches my nipples, hard. I cry out and he chastizes me for speaking out of turn. He pinches me harder and I stifle my gasp. He reaches between my legs and feels my wetness. "You're wet. You like being my slut don't you?" "Oh yes, sir." I say, still not daring to move. He enters me with his fingers roughly, burying two deep inside me as I stand, naked, in front of him. "You know what I do to sluts don't you?" he asks me. "No, sir?" "I fuck them. Lay down."I lay on my back, trembling, waiting for him. He instructs me to touch myself, but warns me that I may only do as he tells me. I am to pinch my nipples, rub my breasts, then play with my clit. He sits and watches. He tells me to spread my legs wider for him and I do. I'm dripping wet and I want him but I don't dare ask. I continue to work my clit and ache to feel something inside me. I let a finger wander down and into my slit. He moves towards me quickly and pulls my hand away. He slaps my face hard."Push your tits together." he tells me then, and I squeeze them together. He straddles me and begins to fuck my cleavage. "Lick it." and I do. With every thrust I catch the head of it on my tongue and taste the wonderful sweet precum lingering on the tip. He moves down then to suck on my nipple. Soft at first and I moan. He places a hand over my mouth, stiffling me, and begins to nibble. Then bite. The pain shoots through my body, and I love it.He moves up and handcuffs my hands to the bedpost above me. It doesnt take him long for his dick to find me and force his way roughly inside me. He places his hand over my mouth again, and begins to fuck me hard. The bed is shaking and between my handcuffed hands, his hand pressing down on my mouth, and the weight of him on top of my I cant move. He tells me to wrap my legs around him and I do. He fucks me hard. Harder. He moves his hand to my throat, wrapping his large hand over it and beginning to squeeze. Lightly at first, just so I can feel it. Then harder as he fucks me more and more roughly. I'm having trouble breathing and am light headed. All I can focus on is the feeling of him filling me, hard, fast, I want more.He releases me suddenly and tells me to turn over. I struggle to do so because of my bound hands, but I manage to balance on my knees and my forearms. He pushes down my back so I am on my knees on my face and spreads my legs. He shoves two fingers into me as he leans over and whispers in my ear "You're just my little slut aren't you? You love when I fuck you." "yes, sir. I do, sir." I answer. "I don't care. You know I'm going to fuck you however I want. You couldn't stop me if you tried. You know that, don't you?" "Yes, sir." "Yes, sir, what?" he demands. "Yes, sir, I know you fuck me as you please, sir. I know I can't stop you, sir." "Good." He responds and pushes his cock deep inside me again. He is kneeling with his knees inside mine. He grabs me roughly by the hips and slams his cock into me again and again. I bite the mattress to keep from crying out. The pain and pleasure course through me. I can feel how big he is, how bruised my hips are becoming under his grasp, and its still not enough. He slaps my ass hard. I can feel the blood rush to the surface. He slaps me again. He then moves his hand to his cock as it slams in and out of me. He rubs his thumb in my wetness until its dripping, then slides it up to my ass. He begins rubbing the tight little hole and I gasp.He knows I've never done this before and it excites him. He continues to fuck me, one hand holding my hip and the other rubbing my ass. He uses his index finger and works the tip into me. The sensation is new. I can feel my muscles contracting around him and I try to relax, its hard to concentrate as he fucks me so hard. His finger moves in farther and I love it. He begins to fuck me with it as his cock continues to slam me. Faster and faster his finger moves and I can't help moaning loudly. "You don't cum until I tell you." He barks at me and I nod my head as best as I can. "I can't hear you." He says. "Yes, sir. Not until you tell me, sir." I manage to get out.It takes all of my concentration to keep my orgasm at bay as he fucks me with both his cock and his finger. He tells me to move my legs even wider, and I do. I feel exposed and full and I want nothing more than to cum. He makes me wait."You want to cum, don't you slut?" "Yes sir... please sir..."
I beg him. I want it so bad. I can't take much more before exploding. "Fine. Cum for me slut." He tells me as he buries his finger into my ass and begins to fuck both holes hard. I scream as an orgasm rips through my body. My legs are shaking, and I can feel my muscles spasming. Wave after wave after wave and it feels like I cum forever. He pulls out and cums all over my ass and back, and I can feel his hot cum running over me. I finally stop shaking and collapse onto the bed, spent, his slut.

Office Hours
This is one I've been thinking about for over two years. I signed up for the course to fulfill a GEC. First day of class the professor walked in. He was in his late 30s, maybe very early 40s. 6'1", medium build. He had sandy blonde/brown hair and grey eyes, and he wore glasses. His jaw was strong, it always looked like he hadn't shaved in a day or two. When he spoke he had so much energy, he stroked everything he touched, and got very close when he spoke. I wanted him immediately. I'd never fantasized about an older man before... but I wanted him. All the girls in the class did. He was well known as the hottest professor in the department. And I wondered... how would it be?I walk through the cold wind, pulling my jacket more closely around me to get to his office. When I finally reach his door, into the warmth, my cheeks are flushed with cold and my hair has been swept by the wind. He looks up from his desk as I enter and close the door behind me. It's late. He's always the last one in the building at night. He's sitting at his desk with his feet up on the desk as they always are. His office is dark with the dusk outside, only a desk lamp illuminating the room. I thank him for the recommendation he wrote for me, and tell him of the outcome. We move on to chatting about our lives, I'm struggling for things to say because I don't want to leave him. Our eyes meet. I'm no longer a student. I smile at him, letting my eyes betray my mind as there is a lapse in the conversation. The akward silence filled with sexual tension. I see his muscular hands, folded in his lap, now tense in waiting. "You must be hot in that coat" he says as he stands and walks to me, helping pull it off my shoulders when I've unbuttoned it. We're standing so close. I can feel his warm breath on me and neither of us steps away. The coat has fallen to the ground. He touches my cheek, now flushed with my heat instead of cold. I feel electricity from his fingertips, I want him to keep touching me. I take a step closer, now only inches apart. He leans down to kiss me. Softly at first. Unsure. Is this wrong? I don't care. He doesn't either. I reach my hands behind his neck as my tongue dances with his and our kiss becomes more passionate. He hands moving now. To my lower back. Pulling me into him hard. I'm pressing against him as we kiss and I can feel him already hard, and still growing. I want him so badly, I don't want to wait. My fingers move across the buttons on his shirt, quickly releasing them and sliding it off. He pulls my sweater over my head and his hand finds my breast, cupping it and squeezing. A moan escapes my lips. This encourages him and he unclasps my bra, letting it fall to the ground. Every move he makes is that of an experienced man. Quick and sure of himself, strong and confident that he's giving me pleasure. I reach down and unfasten his belt and pants, I drop to my knees and pull down his pants and boxers. He springs free and I admire his cock.. hard and waiting for me. I lick my lips as I look up and you smile down at me. I lick delicately, tasting the precum that has formed on the tip of the head, then devouring him in one quick motion. I slide him all the way into my mouth and into my throat, gagging just slightly as his dick slides along the back of my throat... he moans loudly when I do this. I suck and lick him while massaging his balls, he stands transfixed staring down at me. His hands buried in my hair, he begins to pull me up. I stand. His hands move from my breasts, across my stomach, grazing my navel ring and he hikes up my skirt. He pushes me back against the wall as his fingers reach down, searching. He reaaches under my skirt and smirks when he realizes I was wearing no underwear. He finds my clit and encircles it expertly. I feel weak all over and am suddenly glad I'm leaning against a wall. He moves down and buries one large finger into me, finding me already wet and waiting for him... I've wanted this for so long. He fucks me slowly with one finger before working in a second. "take me pleasee" I beg him. He continues to tease me and my hand finds his hard dick, still wet from my saliva. I stroke him firmly, trying to coax him into fucking me. "Please" I ask again, no response... still fucking me with two fingers and smiling down at me. He leans down to kiss me again, hard, pressing my head against the wall. He pulls his fingers out of me and places them in my mouth, telling me to suck them like I want to suck his cock. My tongue goes to work on his fingers, tasting myself on him and getting even more wet, aching for him. He kisses me again as his hands encircle my waist, moving down to cup my ass and hike my skirt up over my waist. He lifts me up by my ass with his two strong hands and presses me against the wall as he slides into me. He's bigger than I've had and it hurts at first, but the pain is so good. I cry out and this spurs him on. He begins fucking me against the wall as I wrap my legs around him, opening myself up to him even more. He feels so wonderfully full in me, and it takes everything in me to not cum immediately. I savor the sensation of him sliding in and out of me, so tight around his cock. He's grunting and pinning me to the wall with his powerful thrusts. The blood is pulsing through my body and I almost can't hear my own moans over the pulse pounding in my ears. He's hitting just the right spot... right there... yes... don't stop.. "Pleasee.." I say again and he fucks me harder. I can feel bruises forming on my back from where I'm being slammed repeatedly into the wall and I dont care, I just want him to fuck me harder. "YES" I cry out as I cum hard. My muscles clenching tightly around him making him fuck me even harder and I feel and explosion courseing through my body... fuck yes keep going... my nails digging into his back so hard they're certain to leave marks. He's cumming now, filling me as he continues to thrust himself into me. One, two, three more times and then he stops, leaning against me. I release my legs from around his waist and he lets me slide down to standing as he slides out of me. I smile sheepishly at him as I gather my clothes and head back out into the cold.

What is it about a guy with a guitar?
Why are they so damn sexy? Think about it... a guy in highschool band? not sexy. A guy in choir? not sexy. A guy playing and singing in his own band? Fucking hot.Something about the fuck-it-all attitude and intensity just makes me want to drop out of school and offer myself to the next hot guitarist coming through town.Case in point... I am currently obsesesed with the song Lying is the Most Fun a Girl Can Have Without Taking her Clothes Off, by Panic! at the Disco. It's about this guy's gf cheating on him I think, but the first verse makes me so hot:Is it still me that makes you sweat?Am I who you think about in bed?When the lights are dim and your hands are shaking as you're sliding off your dress? Then think of what you didAnd how I hope to God he was worth it.When the lights are dim and your heart is racing as your fingers touch your skin.I've got more wit, a better kiss, a hotter touch, a better fuck Than any boy you'll ever meet, sweetie you had meGirl I was it, look past the sweat, a better love deserving of Exchanging body heat in the passenger seat?No, no, no, you know it will always just be meI love that he describes himself as a better fuck, and calls her sweetie as he's taunting her about her cheating. I love how intense he sounds when he's singing. He just sounds so fucking sexy. I basically want to go tell him that I should be his revenge fuck.Sorry for the shorter post but it's been a busy day!P.S. still looking for a name for my new vibe... and yes, he works QUITE well in the shower! :)

An early Christmas gift... to me... from me...
I'd like to introduce you to my new friend:He's happy to meet you too. I ordered him about a week ago and have been anxiously awaiting his arrival. My first toy! When I heard a knock at the door today, I thought it must be him. I rushed to the door, my heartbeat already increasing. The UPS man, the one that has delivered numerous packages to me, tried joking around with me like he always does, but I was a bit too excited to really pay attention to what he was saying. Before handing the package over, he looked at the label and back at me... did he know? Was he familiar with this particular psuedonym for goodvibes.com? I didn't care. I realized I had no batteries (how did I forget to buy batteries?!) so I ran over to the couch and took them out of the remote. Then I was off to my room with my new vibe! Bless goodvibes for making the package easy to open. I was wet by the time I made it to my door and if I'd had to mess with packaging there would have been hell to pay. I ripped open the package and took out my new friend. I quickly unscrewed the back and tried to put the batteries in. They wont fit. What is going on?! Oh. They roll up instructions and put them in the compartment. Apparently I needed to calm down a bit! I took out the instructions, inserted the batteries, removed my clothes and got comfortable on the bed. One twist of the base and there was a wonderful little whirl of the motor and I was off and vibrating! It was very intense with four speeds, but surprisingly quiet. I put the vibe on the lowest speed and began to tease my clit with it. I could feeel vibrations through my whole body- totally amazing! I then moved it down to slide into my already wet and waiting pussy. It was all the way in in one quick thrust, and I was in heaven. I moved it slowly in and out... in and out... enjoying not just the fullness but also the vibrations coming from deep within. I changed the angle and focused on my g-spot, putting constant pressure on it and moving the vibe just slightly back and forth. I twisted the base again and the vibrations became more intense, and again, and again until I was on the highest speed. I worked my g-spot back and forth then slid the vibe back out to tease my clit again, I could feel I was on the verge of an orgasm so I slid it back into myself, rubbing, thrusting it into me...
and then...
the batteries died.
I was not to be deterred! I quickly found the remote for the tv in my room (the one time having tvs in every room of the house pays off), switched out the batteries and I was off and vibrating again. I worked it in and out, fucking myself slowly with it and enjoying the new sensation until I couldnt take it anymore. I slid it out and presesd it right on my clit as wave after wave of my orgasm hit me. And as I lay there recovering the batteries died again (apparently using batteries that have been in remotes for over a year is not an effective thing). Afterwards I got dressed, went to work out, and stopped at CVS. On the list? A 12 pack of duracel AA batteries.
I think this is the beginning of a beautiful relationship :) So now the question is to you, what to call my new friend? I'm open to any name suggestions!

Breaking furniture
I stopped at his place after work to hang out for a bit. We were laying on the futon watching a movie, when his hand slid up from my stomach to cup my breast. Gently, lightly, his fingertips traced the curves of it, working up to my nipple. By the time his fingers grazed my nipple it was hard, waiting. I let out a small sigh and wiggled my ass into his already hardening cock. He gave me a pinch, then slid his hand to reach under my shirt. In moments he had pulled my bra aside and was working on my nipples, stroking, flicking, pinching.I slid my hand behind my back and down onto his now hard cock. I could feel it through the thin fabric, and I began rubbing it slowly. Up and down, the moving down to his balls to massage them gently. As I turned to face him, he slid my shirt off and took off my bra. I removed his shirt and felt his warm chest press against mine. We kissed deeply, tongues hungry for one anothers. I undid the button on his pants and reached to feel his smooth, hard cock. He moaned as I grasped it and began stroking it, paying careful attention to the head.He pulled back and unbuttoned, then removed my pants. He looked at me as I lay there in nothing but panties, and smiled. He bent down to kiss me again and took my hand in his, reaching them both beneath the sheer fabric into my growing wetness. He entwined his fingers with mine as he directed our hands to rub my clit, and press into me. "You're so wet.." he whispered to me. "You tend to have that effect on me" I teased and kissed him again.Our kissing became urgent and we couldnt wait any longer. "Please take me" I begged. He removed the last articles of clothing from his body as I slid off my panties. He teased my clit with the head of his hard cock before sliding it into me in one fluid motion. I felt full, stretched, wonderful. He moaned as he felt me contract my muscles around him. I was breathing heavily... always amazed by how good he felt. I wrapped my legs around his waist as he began to get a rythm. Harder I urged him as I tilted my pelvis up to wrap my legs around his chest now.He slammed into me again and again until I could tell he was close to coming. Stop. I told him and made him sit up. I climbed on top of him, stradling him as I lowered myself onto him. Slowly. Just the head, in and out, then a few more inches, slowly, in and out. Please he begged me. No. I said smiling... he wasn't done with me yet. After a few minutes of slowly riding him, I finally thrust myself all the way down onto his cock and began riding him hard. He moaned as I bounced up and down on him, and I can feel him deep deep inside me. I can feel my own orgasm building and I lean back.I move my legs so they are over his shoulders and my feet are pressing against the back of the futon, supporting myself with my hands behind me on his knees. I continue to ride him hard as he stares at my legs spread for him, and moves his hands to my clit. He starts rubbing as I drive myself onto him again and again, and he can hear the impending orgasm in my moans. Cum for me he says as he begins rubbing me faster and I lose control as I cum hard. My feet are braced hard against the back of the futon and we hear a crack but keep going, my orgasming fueling his, and we fuck hard until we both collapse.Later inspection revealed we did, in fact, break the futon. But in my book.. quite worth it.

I've been tagged!
Thanks to Shen for tagging me on this latest little game... I was just pondering on what my topic for the day would be! So here's the game:1. People who get tagged need to write a blog post of their own 6 weird things as well as state this rule clearly.2. At the end, you need to choose 6 people to be tagged and list their names. Don't forget to leave a comment that says you are tagged in their comments and tell them to read your blog.So here we go!1-When I get close to orgasming the bottom of my feet itch.2-I didn't purchase my first toy until I was 223-I hate the words hump and horny.4-When I was in highschool I used to masterbate while babysitting (after the kids went to bed, of course), usually to Cosmo magazines owned by the mom.5-I've never given road head because I'm convinced if I do there will be an accident and my head somehow will be stuck like that until my parents arrive on the scene.6-The first time I masterbated was before I knew what an orgasm was. When I felt a very strange thing beginning to happen I got really scared and stopped what I was doing--laying there afraid I'd seriously hurt myself.Well- thats me! And now I get to tag some people! I tag:http://tornshorts.blogspot.com- Torn Shorts & Anteatershttp://rogerothornhill.typepad.com- Confessions of an English Gentlemanhttp://easilyaroused.co.uk- Easily Arousedhttp://bostoniansexpert.wordpress.com- Bostonian Sexperthttp://bribrannabanana.blogspot.com- Bribrannabananahttp://dirtylittlemind.blogspot.com- Dirty Little Mind

Spank me
A new fantasy has been born. I don't know what it never occured to me before... but once it did I couldn't stop thinking about it.There's a slight chill in the air and I get goosebumps when he looks at me. I'm in the outfit he likes. Short brown and blue plaid skirt, knee socks, high heels, tight button down shirt that's open from the nipples up. He tells me I've been bad. I've disobeyed a command. I need to be taught a lesson. He sits on the edge of the bed and summons me to come to him. I do as he commands, of course. He tells me to bend over him, I do as I'm told. He pulls my skirt up over my waist, exposing my ass barely covered in the new black thong I'd bought just for him. He rubs his hands over the cheeks, soothing the goosebumps. Just as I start to relax I feel his hand leave me. He places his right hand on the small of my back, firmly, pinning me to the bed. Then *thwap* a hard slap lands on my left cheek. I can feel blood rushing to the surface as it grows hot from the sting. Before I catch my breath another hard smack lands on my right cheek. He is just getting warmed up. He pulls my thong down off my ass, but not quite to my knees. He admires me laying across him. Thong pulled down but not off, skirt hiked up over my waist, his handprints now clearly visible on my ass. He slaps me again, and again. With each contact I feel a sharp sting, I gasp, and I grow wet. I love the feeling of being under his control. His domination. I crave my punishment. He decides that his hand is not enough and grabs a ruler to inflict a more exacting punishment. I'm both scared and excited. He repeats his process.... holding me down... rubbing, then the rule finds it mark. Its sting is much sharper, I cry out, but only a little. This excites him. He brings it down on my again and again as I grow more and more wet. He soothes my now bright red ass with his hands, rubbing, and letting a finger or two slip. He is pleased with the response I've had to his punishment. He places the ruler next to him on the bed and commands me stand up, and lean over the bed. He takes his place behind me, my skirt still merely hiked up, and reaches his hands around me, inside my shirt, and find my nipples already hard. He gives them a hard pinch, just hard enough it hurts and I love it. He runs his hands from my nipples, down my sits and holds my hips. I know what is coming. He enters me in one long thrust. I feel him buried deep in my and I gasp and fall forward. He fucks me hard. Pulling almost all the way out each time and driving it into me hard. I can feel bruises forming on my hips from his hands digging into me, pulling me towards him as he drives himself into me each time. I can feel him losing control and feel my own orgasm building. A few more thrusts and I'm going to cum and he can hear it in my moaning. He fucks me harder as I cum hard, pressing myself back into him even farther and my moaning pushes him over the edge. He cums deep inside me. I'm satisfied.

Craving
I think I'll be ready to start dating again soon and I find myself daydreaming about the types of men I'll meet and how the dates will be. This inevitably leads me to thinking about all the fun things I've been missing out on, and fantasizing about things I'd like to do to the lucky man that asks me out. Here's one particular scenario I havn't been able to get out of my mind.I sit next to him on the couch. The lights are dim and there's some movie going although I've forgotten which one now. This isn't our first date, but we're not yet out of the akward and nervous stage of early dating. We make distracted chit chat and I know we're both thinking of what may come next. Finally he kisses me. Not our first kiss.. but the first like this. Long, deep, urgent. I sink into his kiss, my hands reaching to caress his face, chest, stomach. I can feel his hand moving slowly up my side, resting just inches away from my breast that is begging to be touched, squeezed, carressed. He makes me wait. It could only be minutes but it seems like hours until he finally moves his hand over me, breathing heavy now. He pinches my nipple and I inhale sharply. I let my hands wander south, to the bulge growing beneath his jeans. We continue like this, kissing and groping, and we both want more. I pull away and slide from the couch to the floor, onto my knees. I see the look on his face... hopefull... but still not sure what is in store for him. I pull his legs apart and shimmy between them. I take my time unfastening his belt and pants, never taking my eyes off his. I pull down his pants and boxers just far enough to let his engorged member pop out... but I don't touch it. Instead I lean back on my heels, keeping his gaze and smiling. I take my time tying my hair back... letting him watch me and wait for what he now knows is coming. Finally I lean over him. Take him in my hand and bend my head so he can feel my hot breath. I take one slow, luxurious lick from the underside base of his cock to the head, all while watching his eyes on me. I swirl my tongue around the head, and enclose my mouth around it. I can taste the sweet precum that has already developed and I can feel the blood pulsing. I pull him out of my mouth and lick up and down, trailing my tongue everywhere and getting him nice and wet. I watch him as I take him all into my mouth. I caress his balls with my hand and slowly move up and down on his cock. I suck him off until he is on the brink and then stop. Wait. Make him be patient... I smile as I tease him. I bring him close again and stop. I tease him until he can't take it anymore and then I take him over the edge. I feel him explode into my throat and he loses control. When its all over I carefully put him back into his shorts, zip up his jeans and smile up at him...

G-Spot
Who says TV isn't education anymore? Certainly not I!I was watching one of my favorite trashy shows last night, Nip/Tuck, and a client came in for a VERY interesting new procedure: G-Spot Amplification. The doctor finds a woman's g-spot and injects it with a shot of collagen. This enlarges the g-spot and makes it more sensitive, causing more intense and more frequent orgasms. Of course I couldn't let this information pass without doing a little research (I AM a grad student after all!). I found a very informative site: http://www.thegshot.com/password/process.htmlApparently this is an actual and not uncommon procedure. How cool! Why is this not offered during yearly checkups?? Apparently it's easy, fast, and safe. There's no information about cost, and I'm guessing insurance doesn't cover it (although they should), but what are amazing orgasms really worth? :)In my research I also learned another very exciting fact: women can learn to have multiple orgasms! Is this common knowledge? I didn't know. I've always just had one and felt done and I just assumed I couldn't do anything else. I thought that some women were just wired to have multiples and others could only have singles. Apparently not true! Most women, it turns out, have to train their bodies to do this. I've always been so jealous of the stories of women who would have orgasm after mind shattering orgasm and want to go back for more... but now I'm determined to become one of those women!Apparently it just takes the right state of mind, a focus on the g-spot instead of the clit, and a lot of practice. I'm willing to put in the time! I'm not entirely sure I've had a g-spot orgasm.. I definitely have some stronger than others, but I'm not sure if it's one of those things where if you'd had it you'd KNOW. I know where my g-spot is and I usually incorporate g-spot stimulation into my masterbation routine... but I usually get so aroused from it that the slightest brush of my clit sends me over the edge.So- a challenge has been born. I will learn to become a multiple orgasmer. I will practice tirelessly until I meet this challenge! :) And to aid me in my new goal: http://www.goodvibes.com/Item--i-1-2-AH-0203--m-39 I've purchased this little item from goodvibes. It will be my first sex toy and I am very excited!!

The internet
No better encouragement for blogging than having a big paper to write!The internet is an interesting place. I've recently rediscovered a previously forgotten facet of the internet: chatrooms. When I was a young teenager, 13 or 14 maybe, I was hooked on chatrooms. I was very curious and had never had a boyfriend, and I loved to pretend I was 16 or 17 and talk to guys about all the stuff I'd done and wanted to do (lying of course about all the stuff I'd done because I hadn't done anything!). "Cybering" as they call it, was a favorite passtime of mine. It's funny to look back on now because all the guys I was talking to that were supposedly anywhere from 16-20 were probably either 13 like me, or creepy old pedophiles. And I'm sure it was obvious I'd never actually done anything in real life- I'd never even seen a naked man let alone had sex with one. Anyways, I then turned 15, got my first boyfriend (which turned into a string of boyfriends) and completely forgot about chatrooms.Fast forward until last week, and my new found singledom, and I remembered a little thing called the chatroom! Of course I'm older now, and I don't lie about my age or my experience. I also don't care to cyber. I don't know why... the idea of it just bothers me now. The whole role-playing thing seems too funny, and straight up mutual-masterbation just weirds me out. I don't know why. I basically enjoy going and finding nice guys to talk to. Sometimes about sex and sometimes not... more often about sex. It's fun to just chat about experiences, preferences, fantasies. I don't know why this isn't crossing a line and cybering is... but whatever!Most guys that "private message" me are annoyed that I won't cyber, but I've met a few very interesting ones:The Married man:We spoke for over an hour before I finally asked him why a man of 32 years hadn't settled down. Turns out he had and his wife was out of town for the weekend. This kind of annoyed me because although I don't think he had crossed into "cheating" in our conversation, it sounds as though he had in many others and that's not right. I was willing to overlook it until he asked me to call him. He said he was great at phone sex and he really wanted to hear my voice. I told him I don't have phone sex with random guys, especially not married ones, and there was no way in hell I was giving my cell number to anyone in a chatroom. He spent the next HOUR trying to convince me to call him. I was not playing coy, I was saying no. After about 1.5 hrs he finally gave up and blocked me haha. What a weirdo.Mr. Big:Now of course I have no way to know if someone is lying in a chatroom... but this man I talked to for about 4 hours. I was being completely honest and I think he was too. I think this because he told me both good and bad things about himself, and I did the same. Of course that doesn't mean he wouldnt lie about the size of his dick... but I choose to believe he wasn't lying because that's more fun. 9 inches long and 3 inch diameter was his claim. That would be a huge dick. He told me about the many problems he's had with it and the girls he's dated, and has discovered that being a bit smaller is really probably preferable. I had so much fun talking to this guy, we had a lot of the same fantasies and he had tried things I hadn't- like anal. He seemed really into experimentation and I just had a blast coming up with fun scenarios we'd like to try out some day. I actually did end up getting myself off while talking to him, and he did the same. I guess that is "cybering," but I don't plan to make a habit of it. By the time we did it I felt like I knew him pretty well and I was going to get myself off as soon as I signed off so I figured why not just let him in on the secret!The Canadian:Super fun guy. Canadian studying abroad in Scotland. He is currently in a long term relationship that is about to end, so we had a lot of common ground to chat about. We talked about nonsexual stuff for as long as we talked about sexual stuff, and I had a lot of fun. He was also eager to experiment, and was very interested in my submissive nature. He'd never tried dominance and was excited to try it out with the next girl he had sex with.Overall... I've had fun. I'll probably keep returning to chat rooms. I still don't think I'll be into the cyber thing... but as long as I keep meeting interesting people, I see no reason to stop!
