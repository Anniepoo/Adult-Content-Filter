The Struggle.
Allie. 25. Loves cats and Netflix. Vet student, single af. I tried to have a normal blog but Supernatural and my love for Dean Winchester/Jensen Ackles took over. Other fandoms including (but not limited to) and in no particular order: Harry Potter, The Vampire Diaries, Arrow, Marvel everything, Disney everything, The Flash, Buffy/Angel, Firefly, American Horror Story, Charmed, OUAT, Sherlock, the list goes on.
Oh, and fair warning: as the Smut Queen, I reblog a lot of smutty fanfiction. I also use curse words and I generally don't tag NSFW language every time I drop an F bomb. If either of those bother you, mabye I'm not the blog for you :) Happy tumbling!

Ok this just came across my facebook and I just can’t.
But like… you chose to have a child? Who do you expect to pay you for caring for a child that you brought into the world?? I’m not anti-stay-at-home mom, and I’m not diminishing how hard it is to raise kids and be a full time mom. But why are you acting like you’re doing the world a favor? You’re literally doing what you’re legally obligated to do by taking care of your kid.
This is why I don’t want kids, man. Because I don’t want to put that much time and energy into raising a child. Kids cost money and contrary to the hopes and dreams of some of my fb friends, they don’t bring in much money for quite some time.
Like you’re saying that you don’t want to diminish the work it takes to raise a child…. But you are. It’s selfish of you to just say “I don’t want kids b/c they don’t bring in money” like people don’t have kids and stay at home and raise them for your enjoyment, people don’t have kids to make money, they have them b/c it’s a joyful experience, it brings people happiness 😒 yikes back at you.
Use of generic “you” ahead. Not aimed at a specific person. Just the general “you”.It’s a joyful experience that brings people happiness, but people think they deserve six figures to do something that’s so great and fun and wonderful? Expecting money for a financial burden that you brought into the world is selfish. Me having a kid would be selfish, because the idea of a baby is nice in a very VERY abstract way to me, but I know that right now I’m not ready for the commitment. However, me pointing out that kids cost a lot of money and don’t bring in money is not selfish. It’s a fact. And I don’t expect people to raise their kids for my personal gain or enjoyment. I simply expect them not to bitch about a choice that they made. Not sorry that I don’t feel bad that moms and dads have to work hard when they chose to have children or to partake in sexual activity without contraceptives. I also believe that you shouldn’t bring a child into the world if you don’t have financial means to support it, just as I believe that you shouldn’t adopt a dog or cat if you can’t pay for its food, shelter, vet bills. (Yes I know kids aren’t pets but I generalize and believe that you shouldn’t be responsible for another life if you can’t keep it happy and healthy.)In conclusion, I’m still annoyed and pissed off that this facebook friend of mine that’s a young mom shared a post about how stay at home moms deserve a big ass salary. Not because they don’t work hard, but because it implies that they consider it “work” and that they need incentive to do it.

oh
and yikes.
i'm at the stage in my life where i still consider having a child
at least for myself
to be a consequence of my actions
not a blessing or whatever
so to me
if i got knocked up tomorrow
and 9 months down the road i had a kid
i would not be happy
but i also wouldn't be saying that i think i deserved to be paid for it
in that case it would be me dealing with the consequences of my actions
i had unprotected sex
now i have a kid that's my responsibility
for me it would totally suck
but i still wouldn't share that facebook post
because raising and caring for the kid is what's expected
it's like graduating from high school
congrats you did what everyone around you also did
here's a special hat

Do you have a selfie tag?
I’m not nearly organized enough for that. Sometimes I tag them “shut up allie” or “my face” but not always. Originally posted by d-e-c-e-p-t-i-o-n-a-l-l-y(The real question is: why would you want to look at multiple pictures of my face?)

I want to know your first name.
I would pay money to see Jensen Ackles step out of his house in that orgasm donor shirt now. Like with the tats and piercings and facial hair and mohawk it’s quirky and cute. With normal Jensen face, we would all be on the ground crying.
Is it just me or did you think he looked younger when he shaved and got rid of the Mohawk?
younger, cuter, more dateable, all the good things.
I wonder if he got to keep the shirts…
photo op idea: bring orgasm donor shirt and make him wear it.
Loads of copies on the photo op idea @but-deans-back-tho
People have done it already??? I want to see!
