Sewing with Porcupines
Sewing with Porcupines
All the pretty dresses drowning in an ocean of ugly mannequins. Life is chalk. Dust in the black. Particles coalescing in a long series of guesses.

Goodbye Pathmark
In New Jersey we have different grocery stores from the rest of the nation. I don't know why that is, but that's how it's always been. There's no Giant or Kroeger or wherever the hell else the rest of the country shops for food. We have ShopRite, Pathmark, Stop and Shop and A&P.
The local Pathmark has been in existence since 1974. As long as I have been alive it's been there selling food and haba and lightbulbs. Because food stores in the northeast also sell hardware. Cuz that's how we roll.But all that is about to change. The various Pathmarks and A&P's have been closing all over the tristate area, but there were a few holdouts.Sadly, now even the hangers on are shuttering their doors very soon.It probably wouldn't be difficult to point out all the ways which these corps could've driven more sales to their locations, but why beat a dead horse. It's done. The grave has been dug.While they may have been poorly managed both at a corporate and local level, I think their primary downfall was Wal-Mart. When Wal-Mart started selling a full selection of food stuffs that was the begining of the end.I don't shop at Wal-Mart. Because they are evil. I won't be starting to any time in the forseeable future. They're not evil because they put this one set of stores out of business. They're evil because this is what they do everywhere. They saturate markets with cheap shit  and cheap labor and destory all kinds of businesses. And really the people are to blame. The customers. For shopping there. But people are stupid. And people suck. You can't fix that. But you can hate Wal-Mart. That's easy.The strangest part is that the people working at Pathmark seem happy about it closing. Most of them .have been working there a very long time. It's like they've been set free from their bondage.Personally, I'm sad about it. I think they are too, brave faces not withstanding.

Truths
America has become a massive joke. This upcoming election is nothing short of embarrassing. Nothing seems to be real anymore. It's all just fodder for the media. A half turned thought that expires in the small space where it barely lived.Clowns and hypocrites and lunatics. Those are our leaders. As if we have a choice in who shall lead us. As if wealth isn't the determining factor in all things of power and influence.Was a time I thought Obama was something big. Something new and powerful.That fact is, there is nothing new. Nothing real. Nothing at all substantial. There are only cartoon faces and demented machetes of men. All of them clamoring for a fading a pot of gold in the midst of our collective apocalypse.Politics are at best a dialogue. At worst, a gauntlet. We are all of us, delusional pragmatists. Imagining there is an end to this eternal conflict.We wager our fury in bursts of righteousness not fit for human consumption. We vainly declare ourselves guardians of a world that is much more powerful that we could ever hope to become.We stumble through our hysteria and greed. Crazed lemmings unaware of the cliff. Certain gravity will spare us.Our self-importance is epic. Our ignorance is immeasurable. As a species we are a balck hole of self awareness. Entirely reliant of the premise of God. That a supernatural force will eventually save us all.And we call animals dumb?

MasterChef Cinnamon Rolls Challenge Bogus
On the latest episode of MasterChef (USA) the elimination challenge was to make cinnamon rolls in 45 minutes. The problem? Cinnamon rolls are a yeast risen dough and the dough rise alone takes at least an hour. Yet the show went on pretending as though the contestants were creating the rolls from scratch, plus icing in the allotted 3/4 hours.I realize that step could've been omitted. If all contestants were permitted to create and rise their dough prior to the timed portion and started all on equal footing it would not affect the overall outcome. Reality TV often skips ahead for the sake of expediency. However, the contestants are clearly seen mixing dough from scratch during the challenge. There is no mention of yeast or rising. And the message that only 45 minutes are allowed is vehemently reinforced. Regardless of whether or not it has any impact on the end result, to pretend the entire feat can be accomplished in only 45 minutes, is insulting to viewers. And bad form as far as urgency tactics go.
Most folks who watch cooking shows know how to cook. To try to imply that one can make genuine cinnamon buns in that amount of time is ridiculous and insulting. I know it sounds crazy, but just be honest. Your audience will appreciate it.

Drivers of New Jersey I Ask You Why
In the state of New Jersey the vehicle to your right has the right of way. This normally applies to uncontrolled intersections or multi-stop sign ones. Not that anyone issued a driver's license seems to understand this concept. Their ignorance of this statute is never more apparent than when one is a bicyclist riding in traffic.
When you are at an intersection and a cyclist is to your right that cyclist is the vehicle to your right and therefore has the right of way. If you wish to make a right turn and the cyclist is going straight through the intersection, then you must yield to the cyclist.
The rules of the road are all well and good. We all disobey them here, there and everywhere. I haven't come to a complete stop at a stop sign without oncoming traffic since forever.
So don't obey traffic laws. Honestly, I don't care.
What baffles me. What truly boggles my mind is that people will just simply go without any worry about killing someone or maiming someone for life.
Automobile drivers in New Jersey are a curious animal. It seems like when people get behind the wheel some part of their brain turns off that's normally active.
You wouldn't swing a bat at some innocent person's head. You wouldn't shoot someone just for walking down the street. You wouldn't punch someone in the face who's just standing there.
Yet when driving your vehicle you'll quite confidently keep going though the sign says to yield. You'll keep accelarting even as a pedestrian tries to cross the street. You'll make a right turn inches in front of a cyclist attempting to go straight.
Even if you don't understand that you're supposed to yield, (you are supposed to yield by the way),  shouldn't your conscience compel you to yield? Seriously.
If you do not yield, you could literally end someone's life!
When a motor vehicle and a bicyclist collide, the motor vehicle is going to win every time.

Organ Donation
I would like to be an organ donor. Just not in the traditional sense. I don't want to wait until I die in a car accident or am shot in the head. I want to donate my organs right now.
Put me under anesthesia, harvest all that you can and then let me die. You can take my corneas, my heart, lungs, kidneys, bone marrow, blood. Liver's probably useless. But everything else is in good working order. I wonder if this is legal anywhere in the world. Suicide my organ donation. That has a nice ring to it. It seems perfectly logical to me. I've got all these vital body parts. There are lots of folks who desperately need them. It's a win win for all concerned.

Food Lies
Here's something I've wondered about for quite some time now. Health activists, dieticians, doctors, scientists... they're always saying soda is bad for you. Diet soda is bad and regular sugar soda is bad too. They're bad for you because fake sugar and regular sugar are bad for you. But lots of other foods contain equal amounts of either real sugar or fake sugar and nobody ever rags on them. How about yogurt. Yogurt really annoys me because it's always touted as being so healthy. Everyone is always going on about how good it is for you. No one ever says stay away from those lite yogurts because they're full of cancer causing aspartame. No one. Ever. And non lite yogurt is just as bad. It has tons and tons of sugar. Like candy bar amounts of sugar. But no one ever says you shouldn't eat yogurt because it's full of unhealthy sugar. No one. Ever. Spaghetti sauce is also full of sugar and salt. No one ever publishes articles on the dangers of eating tomato sauce. Instead we're told it's good for us. Instant oatmeal. No studies on how bad that is for us. Yet it's got lots of sugar and very little nutrition thanks to over-processing. But we're constantly being told how oatmeal is good for us. No one ever specifies that instant oats are not a part of this equation. Ever see any articles on the dangers of consuming instant oatmeal? Yeah... No. All these so-called experts and advocates are nothing more than hypocrites, liars and political/industry pawns. And on another food related note... why do christians eat ham on easter? It makes no sense. Jesus was jewish and therefore would never have eaten ham.

Comcast Madness (In a Good Way)
Labels:
comcast,
xfinity
The funniest thing happened to me on the way to get a modem. No seriously... something crazy really did happen with comcast. Not crazy bad, like most stories about them. Actually pretty good. I'm no fan of them. They will drive you crazy. I think I just got lucky is all. When my modem couldn't connect on March 16 and 2nd level tech support said it ws either my modem or my lines, I asked how much to rent a comcast modem. I figured I could return it at any time and it would be good in the interim. He said $9 or $10. So rather than run to best buy and make a rash purchase I ran to comcast and made a rash rental instead. When the lady at the counter asked me what I needed, I said I wanted to rent a modem. I also double checked with her. I said it's around $9, right? And she agreed. The whole transaction took only minutes. She asked for my home phone and then promptly presented me with their all in one gateway device (internet, router, phone). Apparently, anyone who knows my home phone can show up at comcast and rent modems under my account. A couple weeks later I received my bill and was more than a little confused. It stated that I was now the proud owner of HD Preferred XF Bundle at $119.99 for a period of 12 months. Plus a few taxes, surchages and adapter fees. $128.57 total. But this now includes HD channels, Starz, Performance Internet and Xfinity Voice. Thing is, I'd always had Digital Starter TV and Peformance Internet. No phone. For many, many years. I never asked for any upgrades and was never told any were intiated on my behalf. There was even a brand new phone number given to us that was listed on the bill. This was news to me. No one ever said the TV had been upgraded or that phone had been added. I could've been watching all these additional channels and I could've been watching them in HD. I might not have renewed with magicjack, which I just did days ago. But I had no idea I had all these new features. Weirdest part is, the bill still only rose the $9 they originally said for the cost of the modem. My old bill was $119.74 for just internet and TV. TV with far fewer channels, No Starz and no HD. And no phone service at all. And somehow because I walked into the local office and asked to rent a modem, I'm receiving all these numerous extras for just the cost of renting a modem. And no one thought this was information that they should share with me. So the next time you're unhappy with the price/value of your comcast service, try going in and renting a modem and you might just get a nice surprise.
