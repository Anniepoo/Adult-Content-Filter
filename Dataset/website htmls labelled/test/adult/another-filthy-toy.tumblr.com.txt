Always understand your role!
He smelled like Scotch and expensive perfume when he walked in at 1 am. He skipped the dinner you prepared and ignored your text messages all night long.
It hurts, but you forgive him; and you want to show him he’s forgiven. His pleasure always comes first. Don’t just accept your role, be the best at it.

Perverted: Girls Getting Pissed on in Public Bathrooms
I wish I could say I try so hard to do a good job for some principle reason, some commitment to excellence.  But I do it for the reward, for the taste of your cock I’m allowed when your happy with my performance.
That trashy outfit and those heels (omg so pink!) would humiliate me more than licking any toilet bowl. That’s a sobering realisation.

so much softness on offer. So much beauty. Those tits would feel so good under my hand. But this is better. This makes me harder. and this makes your thighs part more desperately.
This is the sort of thing that makes me doubt that you really like my small tits. If you did, you’d play with them, wouldn’t you? You’d fondle and pinch them, not grind them under your dirty sole.(Source: torturepain)

She sleeps there for one week.
She lies there from 11pm each night.
She holds the phone because he has set the alarm at different hours throughout the week.
12 pm
1 am
2 am
3 am
4 am
5 am
6 am
When the nightly alarm sounds, he unchains her and allows her to crawl in to the warm, soft bed next to him.
He might warm her up.
He might casually push his cock into her pussy, and drive into her, spilling into her before he goes back to sleep.
He may just ignore her completely.
She has no prior knowledge of when the alarm will sound.
Until then she lies on the cold carpet.
Naked.
Shivering.
Feeling a little sorry for herself.
Wondering why he can’t love her in more conventional ways, on these cold, winter nights.
He gets up to get ready for work at 7 am each day.
She knows she must get up to.
Irrespective of how little sleep she’s had.
It’s only for a week.
She can cope.
She can still function at work.
There’s nothing wrong with this.
She’s simply enduring a very slight hardship, that’s all.
Just so that he can effortlessly demonstrate once again, the total control he has over her at all times.

A week of this would drive me insane. It can always be worse, of course. He makes sure of that. See, he fucked me on Monday and gave me these amazing cuddles on Tuesday, but he’s ignored me since. It’s Saturday, and after three nights of laying in the cold darkness, waiting for warmth and acknowledgement, and not receiving any - he just turns over as I clamber into bed and snores on - I’m convinced I’ve done something wrong. Did he hear me sigh on Wednesday? Is that what pissed him off? Has he found someone else to fuck? Has he decided that he prefers sleeping on the bed alone? I can’t figure out what I’ve done wrong, but it must be something! When I apologised yesterday, he just looked puzzled and dismissed me. I’m in bed at 1am, the earliest I’ve been allowed comfort in the last week, but I can’t settle. Without his approval, I don’t know how to go on. Maybe I should suggest something new tomorrow, something I usually refuse to do. Maybe that’ll make him happy …(Source: closetquean)

drecksack2013:
Most of the time the pretty young coed was a normal girl, a normal young woman, going to class, going to work, talking and laughing with her friends, with the worries and concerns of any young woman, but every once in a while, sometimes three times a week, sometimes only once a month, he’d remind her of the debt she owed, remind her of the kind of person she actually was.
He let her keep her old life only because it was so exciting to hear the catch in her voice whenever he called her up, whenever he told her it was time, that he was coming by for a visit, and to prepare herself for him, to prepare herself to make up for her sins.
She looked so sweet, so pretty, so soft and inviting, whenever he was with her.  As much as he enjoyed her youth and beauty, though, the look of suffering in her eyes, the way tears would sometimes flow as he humiliated and abused her, as he degraded her, as he raped her, as he hurt her soft flesh–he enjoyed that the most.
At some point, he knew, he was going to take her old life away from her, he was going to completely and utterly destroy her, turn her into little more than a human fleshlight, into a degraded piece of meat whose only purpose would be to suffer at the hands of men, but, until then, he could enjoy the delicious, delicate suffering in her eyes.

lady-is-the-tramp:
maybe one day I’ll earn sleeping at the foot of the bed
I appreciate this picture a little more every time I see it. I love that she’s naked and uncovered - largely because I’m always cold and can’t sleep blanket-less and this would a wonderful, one-off night of torture. I love that she’s so close to him and yet she has the security of being chained to the bed. I love that she’s holding her phone, presumably because she has an alarm to wake her before him, but it reminds me of nights I know I’m going to be woken up for play and I have my phone close so I don’t miss the texts.(Source: closetquean, via lipstickissmeared)

littlesubshay:
That really problematic feeling when you have completely inappropriate feelings about Kilgrave.
But like.. Complete mind control… so hot
If only it was used within a framework of consent and boundaries.
So, my head and pussy are having very very conflicted feelings about Jessica Jones right now.
It’s unfortunate.
Omg yes! Not the mind control so much for me, but the little tortures. Like when he wouldn’t let his staff blink? That was awful but so hot. I loved how casually he ordered them to do this little thing that hurt them so much. And yet the context of control was so wrong and my brain just wanted to skip the scene because I don’t like watching people in pain. That show was so hard to watch.

little-miss-morgan:
My dream is to be permanently wet. I want to soak every pair of panties I put on, and to have every person around me be able to smell my desperate cunt and know what a whore I am. I want my cunt to be such a mess that that men have no trouble identifying me as a desperate slut who should never feel the pleasure of an orgasm. I would leak a trail of wetness wherever I sit and feel the humiliation of having to clean up after myself everywhere I go.
That seems like a fittingly simple dream to bring about.
