Lonely At The Top on iTunes and Audible NOW
6/3/2015
Check out Amber's latest audiobook narration Lonely At The Top by Christina Lewis Halpern, available on iTunes and Audible today!Publisher's Summary:Anxiety, fear of failure, self-consciousness: these are not the qualities you imagine when you hear the word "heiress". But in this powerful account, Christina Lewis Halpern applies a journalist's eye to her own struggles following the death of her father, the late entrepreneur Reginald F. Lewis, when she was 12. At the time of his death in 1993, Halpern's father was the richest black man in America, the Jackie Robinson of American business. His best-selling biography, Why Should White Guys Have All the Fun? details his amazing-rags-to-riches journey from the poverty of segregated Baltimore to the board rooms of Wall Street. This essay, a mix of memoir and reportage, is an exploration of Lewis's legacy: a bluntly honest and deeply human account of what it's like to be the sensitive child of a rich and powerful man. As Halpern follows the past to seek the secrets of her father's success, focusing on his time at Harvard Law School, we learn the story of an American legend, but also the complexities of living with his legacy. ©2012 Christina Lewis Halpern (P)2015 Audible, Inc.What the Critics Say:"Christina Lewis Halpern has written a touching, powerful memorial to her extraordinary father, Reginald Lewis, a Harvard Law School legend." (John Jay Osborn, Jr., author of The Paper Chase)"Christina Lewis Halpern offers a relatable and eye-opening window into her family, racial progress in America and just what success really is." (Baratunde Thurston, author of How to Be Black)"Exceptional" (The Very Short List)

Brooks knows exactly where Cora can find her brother, except he says it's a suicide mission. Cora doesn't care. But Brooks can't let her go....©2013 Frankie Brown (P)2014 Audible, Inc.
The Truth About Truth
2/5/2014
I was honored to take part in the staged reading of a new interpretation of Luigi Pirandello's Così È (Se Vi Pare), a play by Jon Laskin and Michael Aquilante, The Truth About Truth. I read the role of Bethany, a politically-minded blogger recounting the strange behavior of two neighbors in her parents' building. I look forward to the opportunity to help stage a full production of the play soon.
