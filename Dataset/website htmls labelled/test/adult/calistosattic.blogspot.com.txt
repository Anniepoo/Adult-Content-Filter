Warning Objects Appear Closer...
Lust is to the other passions what the nervous fluid is to life; it supports them all, lends strength to them all ambition, cruelty, avarice, revenge, are all founded on lust.

Sunlight In The Morning...
All, all is theft, all is unceasing and rigorous
competition in nature; the desire to make off with the substance of
others is the foremost - the most legitimate - passion nature has bred
into us and, without doubt, the most agreeable one.

Negative Images Of Great Inspiration
It’s better to go out with a bang and a press release than with a whimper and a secret.

Secrets Unfolded
If it is the dirty
element that gives pleasure to the act of lust, then the dirtier it is,
the more pleasurable it is bound to be. One of the advantages of being disorderly is that one is constantly making exciting discoveries.

Docile Slumber
It is always by way of pain one arrives at pleasure.
Lust is to the other passions what the nervous fluid
is to life; it supports them all, lends strength to them all ambition,
cruelty, avarice, revenge, are all founded on lust. Lust's passion will be served; it demands, it militates, it tyrannizes.

Are His.....
Woman's destiny is to be wanton, like the bitch, the she-wolf; she must belong to all who claim her.

A Monday Something
He leaves for work, and she sighs, how she misses Him during the day when He is at work. The day was very hot, humid almost electric in the hair, the breeze a heavy blanket of moisture as she saunters in their bed room. Top drawer is where she keeps her toys, her plays thing, His manipulations of pleasure. She opens said drawer and it silently opens offering for the gooides of her desires. She squeals softly in excitement as her right hand delves into the drawers becoming darkeness.She selects two clothes pegs, the old fashioned wooden kind, that pinch with metal claws closed. Lifting her blouse no bra does she wear, as she tugs pertly on her left nipple before encircling the slightly engorged nipple. Her body arcs as the clothespin clips closed. She does the same to the other one, pert, hard and ready to accept the pain and hardship.Dropping her blouse with groan, she now begins her day. Dishes first..as the pinching tightens further with every passing movement. Drying them was sheer torturing bliss as she moaned softly dripping wetter as the chores past. By the time she had done the vacuuming an hour had past. Her nipples ached hotly now. Reaching up underneath her blouse she release the left one and then the right one.The hot burning flashed made her grunt and then groan, she he taunted and teased herself to a bad state. It was only noon, now what?...

If I Could..
If I could turn back time, change a few things, do something different instead of the path I chose, I would have done things differently. Most of my life has been wayward, now I have direction and guidence with a caring loving hand. At times my direction gets clouded and I lose my way and fall assunder. Try as I may, I still lose my direction and get lost, in the process the owner of my guidence and direction; I lost sight and did not follow the instincts that have been shown to me by Him. I should have seeked out His guidence and direction, now I understand fully the consquences of my actions, and can only hope that I can repair what has been wrought. I have learned a valueable life lesson again in my life, something that should not have been forgotten. Repect. First I must respect myself and then those around me. I can only hope that my short commings will repent itself and so then carry on my life with my hand in His, His in mine.
I think of you, and I miss you. You are the axis in which my world spins, of this I never lose sight on. Please bare with me, I am only human and sometimes it takes a few mistakes to sink into my head the true faction before me. All that I am, all that I will be. I wish to fill that void in your heart that I created...

A Random Ramble
T'is been awhile since I last devulged into the dark recess of my mind, body and soul. A flicker of anticipation tantalizes my lips, a mixture of sweat and spent tears. My face buried into the cradling depths of the pillow, caress my stinging eyes. My knees scored underneath me, my brazenly red buttocks exposed. Earlier this day I had decided I was going to spend the day being mouthy, and pressing the rules/regulations deemed to me by His hand. The sun had set, a glass of red wine each before us sitting on the tray. Unbeknownst to that of myself, He had been brewing hottly with bemused anger, and planning His conquest of reigning in my temperment. The glowering almost smoldering look He gave me went un-noticed, that is until He grabbed mt hair and pulled me stumbling along down the hallway to the bedroom. Where He tossed me upon the bed roughly; I could hear His belt come undone, a shiver ran through my body. My simple white cotton frayed shift was rudely yanked up, exosing my pale globes of an ass up in the air for His inspection. His dark skin hand stroked the left cheek, His darker flesh a deep contrast against my pale whitness.The first lash of the soften leather, was a sudden electrifying shock, as my body jolted forward and His respones was to take a fistful of hair and yank back, arching my back and buttocks higher. Two more full lashes sending a welting arc arcoss both cheeks. I whimpered as three more fell, His grunt apparent as He seemed to enjoy over much this pelting of pain.My eyes clenched closed, my hands curled in child like fists, my tears falling silently as I can be. He stops-I do not hear His actions behind me. I shouted out suddenly as a lash came stingingly against my already pinkish flesh; the tears, turned to sobs, quelled only by that of His cool hand over my burning welts.``Careful what you wish for my Precious.``

Mistress In A Bottle {Part 3}
“Come on precious,” he said breathlessly, gyrating his hips up towards her face thrusting his cock into her ruby painted mouth.  She took his entire length with ease. her lips virtually kissing his pelvic bone as she deep throated his entire shaft, feeling each throb and pulsation.  “Oh yessssss...”  He chanted as she turned up the suction and the pace even more, her dazzling tongue danced on his hardened member making soft suckling sounds echoed in the large chamber.Henry’s body tensed as he held on to the moment of rapture as long as he could.  His toes tingled and his fingers dug into the mattress his fingers churning in the spread upon the bed. Then he released with an “aaaaauuuuuugh” of a sigh.  His cock spasmed with a life of its own, and he blasted rivers of his hot desire down Alisa’s throat.  She sucked his dick like an estranged heathen, vacuuming every drop he could squeeze out of his balls.Henry was spent.  The feeling reminded him of the night he first met Shannon, when she drained him of more than one vital fluid.“Master,” Alisa purred as she crawled up his body her long pony tail teasing a path up his stomach.  She dragged her hard nipples over his bare chest, the thin fabric of the halter separating him from her burning flesh.  “Master, I need you.  I’m so hot.  I’m burning for you.  I need your vampire cock to cool me down.” She pleadedUsing his inhuman power, he willed himself erect again.  Alisa felt his rod press into her wet crotch, and she wiggled her hips against it as she cooed.  Next, Henry flipped over, his body pinning her lithe form into the soft mattress.  He straddled her waist, and he pinned her hands over her head with his own. Looking down at her with an evil tainted smirk.“Do you like that, slave?”She shivered at the word.  “Oh yes, master.  I need you to command me.”“Look into my eyes, slave.”  He stared deeply into her gleaming eyes, pressing his hypnotic powers into her.  “You are helpless to resist me.”Alisa shook her head, a disappointed look on her face.  “I’m sorry, master, but it just doesn’t work that way.  I NEED you because of your wish, but I can’t be controlled by you.”“Why not?” he demanded.  The frustration he was feeling from the situation was becoming evident.“I’m not going to tell you.  You can demand me back into the bottle if you want, but I’m not revealing my secrets.” She whimpered.For the first time in his existence, Henry wanted to strike a woman.  He thought it might beat some sense into her.  Just as quickly, though, the thought passed.  Alisa was beautiful, sexual, and, though he had only known her for a few minutes, he wanted her for more than just a plaything or a source of blood.  He felt stirrings he hadn’t let himself experience since Shannon had been taken from him five decades before.  Given these feelings, he decided a different approach would be better.“Fine,” he said.  “I have my second wish then.  I wish that you be compelled to tell me the truth whenever I ask you a question starting with the phrase ‘tell me this.’”Again, Alisa’s eyes flashed brightly, and then returned to their emerald hue.  “Damn you,” she cursed.  “Why can’t you be like all the others and just wish for things or changes to yourself?  Why do you keep fucking with me?”  She seemed almost on the verge of tears. “What’s wrong with me making wishes that involve you?”She sniffled.  “I’m not used to all of these feelings and things.  I know that I’m going to be stuck back in that bottle soon, and then someone else will free me and it all starts again.  It’s better if we don’t get close, you know?” A sorrow almost edged those beautiful green eyes.Henry pondered her explanation, which started an idea growing.  He put the idea to the side for a moment, though, returning to his original reason for expending the second wish.  “Tel me this: why are you able to resist my hypnosis?”Alisa again shook her head, but then answered anyway.  “I’m a being of magic, so your powers don’t affect me like they would a normal woman.”  Her expression betrayed her surprise at having answered, until she realized the compulsion of his wish.“Tell me this: why didn’t you want to tell me that in the first place?”“Because I want to be affected.  You might say I’m something of a submissive.  That’s why I loved your first wish so much.  No one had ever paid any attention to my wishes before.  But I know it’s all going to end soon, and it hurts too much to think about it.” She trembled, her breasts quivered under the flimsy halter top, the pert nipples poking through like wanton beacons.

The Master Of Her Domain
There is One for everyone. The Master of my Domain is the axis in which my world spins. There shall only be but One.
Among men and women, those in love do not always announce themselves with declarations and vows. But they are the ones who weep when you're gone. Who miss you every single night, especially when the sky is so deep and beautiful, and the ground so very cold......

Quotes Of The First
No person was ever honored for what he received. Honor has been the reward for what he gave.
... and then the day came when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom.
Some people must go to extremes to get the world in balance for themselves. Some can't bear bright lights, so wherever they go they search for the dark; they turn the lights down, anything to sustain some level of comfort.
A casual stroll through the lunatic asylum shows that faith does not prove anything.
Those who hear not the music think the dancers mad. We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars.
See - one side of my face is gentle and kind, incapable of anything but love of my fellow man. The other side, the other profile, is cruel and predatory and evil, incapable of anything but lusts and dark passions. It all depends on which side faces the moon at the ebb of the tide.
Vanquished in life, his death, By beauty amends: The passing of his breath Won his defeated ends...
Alone he rides, alone, The dark and fatal king: Dark night is all his own, That strange and solemn thing.....
Because of thee, the land of dreams, Becomes a gathering of place of fears: Until tormented slumber seems One vehemence of useless tears...
Because of thee, not thought, no thing, Abides for me undersecrate: Dark Angel, ever on the wing, Who never reachest me too late...
Dark Angel, with thine aching lust, To rid the world of penitence: Malicious Angel, who dost-My soul such subtile violence...
The devil's agents may be of flesh and blood, may they not?

Inner Lust
"I am interested in anything about revolt, disorder , chaos--especially activity that seems to have no meaning. It seems to me to be the road toward freedom ... Rather than starting inside, I start outside and reach the mental through the physical."
Her Choice
"History is an account, mostly false, of events, mostly unimportant, which are brought about by rulers, mostly knaves, and soldiers, mostly fools."
Her Inquisitiveness
"I have no special gift; I am only passionately curious."
Her Penance
"How people keep correcting us when we are young! There is always some bad habit or other they tell us we ought to get over. Yet most bad habits are tools to help us through life."
Her Distinction
"Some look at things that are, and ask why. I dream of things that never were and ask why not?"
For The One
"If it is the dirty element that gives pleasure to the act of lust, then the dirtier it is, the more pleasurable it is bound to be."
Defiance Of Authority
"The holder of authority is like the rider of a lion - he is envied of his position but he well knows his position."
Her Displeasure
"One should judge a man mainly from his depravities. Virtues can be faked. Depravities are real."
A Prophecy
"Believe, if thou wilt, that mountains change their place, but believe not that man changes his nature."
Her Pet
"Perfectionism is not a quest for the best. It is a pursuit of the worst in ourselves, the part that tells us that nothing we do will ever be good enough--that we should try again."
Is His
"In this world of extremes, we can only love too little. A kiss never tasted is forever wasted."
Her Incantations
"So many of our dreams at first seem impossible, then they seem improbable, and then, when we summon the will, they soon become inevitable."
In Captivity
"When she raises her eyelids it's as if she were taking off all her clothes."
Her Capture
"It has been my experience that folks who have no vices have very few virtues."
His Demand
"Ordnung ist das halbe Leben. (Order is half of life.)"
By His Command
"Not necessity, not desire--no, the love of power is the demon of men. Let them have everything--health, food, a place to live, entertainment--they are and remain unhappy and low-spirited: for the demon waits and waits and will be satisfied."
Destiny
"In Heaven an angel is nobody in particular."
Her Loyalty
"People who have given us their complete confidence believe that they have a right to ours. The inference is false; a gift confers no rights."
Her Discovery
"Someday, after mastering winds, waves, tides and gravity, we shall harness the energy of love; and for the second time in the history of the world, man will have discovered fire."
Her Curiosity
"If clouds are full of water, they pour rain upon the earth. Whether a tree falls to the South or to the North, in the place where it falls, there will it lie. Whoever watches the wind will not plant; whoever looks at the clouds will not reap."
Forbidden Sin
"The devil's agents may be of flesh and blood, may they not?"
