I think that i at least owe the general public out there some form of explanation.No doubt, some of you have thought to yourself "Finally! The stupid bastard's run out of things to say. He was getting monotonously boring and excessively whiny anyway."Then what the fuck are you doing coming back here when you jolly well know it's supposed to have been shut down?Equally, some of you must have been stricken almost dumb with grief and impotent rage at the disappearance of your favourite source of insightful, witty observations and pertinent pearls of wisdom. Yes, both of you.You see, this blog started way back about two and a half years ago, because I was bored almost to tears by the drudgery of the daily grind of medical school. What begun as a collection of whimsical posts slowly evolved into a kind of public diary, a record of sorts, where I would pen (or type, as it were) down my thoughts, little snippets of emotion and records of how I spent my days in the most unproductive, sometimes unfulfilling of ways.As the content evolved, so did the readership. At first, it was only close friends and family. Soon, however, there were too many people reading - casual acquaintances, people from secondary school whom I'd lost touch with for years, people I actually had a pretty decent amount of loathing for, complete strangers.And still I wrote, and still i blogged.Honest, true to myself.But slowly, gradually, I began to suspect that I wasn't really comfortable having so many people know so much about me. Granted that I didn't write about every single thing in my life, and that even my closest friends, the people I would do almost anything for, didn't know everything about me even after reading this page and correlating what they read with what they knew of and from me during our day-to-day interactions.Still, there was too much of me on display for the world to see.And to know.And to judge.And to indulge in their voyeuristic tendencies.But that's not the reason.You see, I've been through a lot this past year, most, if not all of which remains unknown to everyone. Not almost everyone. EVERYONE. Things that have made me feel, in various measures, angry, sad, depressed, frustrated, lonely, despairing, devoid of all hope, small, worthless, unloved, unappreciated and sometimes, jut plain not good enough. For myself, for the world, for everyone.Of course, all this negativity had to come to a head, and it did recently, culminating in, shall we say, a series of events that tipped me over the edge and decide that it just wasn't worth sharing any of myself with anyone, ever.I will not say what has happened this whole year, nor will I ever again post on this page. The page will remain here as it is.Long term, I have (very tentative) plans to start another blog, somewhere out there, that will be a secret to all by myself and perhaps, just perhaps, a handful of friends. I also plan to write somewhere else, because my fingers and the artistically-inclined part of my brain sometimes itch as badly as my balls do on a warm and humid summer's day, and this second page will be made public, will be amusing and offer devastatingly insightful observations and discussions in equal measure. It's been fun so far, but as this page dies, so does a part of me - the young, innocent, optimistic, idealistic part of me.So long. I'll
let everyone know if and when I ever do set up that other page.And let my parting words be this:
Excessive masturbation can make you blind.posted by

sex and beer.women and wine.what is a man to do when the very things that he was banking on to give him a brief but welcome reprieve from the daliy drudgery of that pesky little thing known as life only end up causing him to sink deeper into his own little private mire of loneliness and self-loathing?a betrayal of trust of sorts, but i suppose i'm just being an oversensitive angry prick.that's what i always am, isn't that right?it's funny. sometimes the people you feel closest to, the people you'd trust, or want to trust, most to care, don't.and people you hardly know, do.or, at least, they put on a better show of it.being nice? honour? principles? worth next to nothing in today's world. and that's an optimistic estimate as well.posted by

it's happened. it's finally happened. from a mild disdain for the moronic buffoons who fail to properly appreciate the august (why august? what did january and december or even july do to exclude their usage as honourable adjectives?) members of my future profession, to a niggling but persistent suspicion that i might not actually be cut out for the job due to my slightly uninspiring academic abilities and pathological attraction to the concept of sleep and enjoyment, i have now arrived at a point where i experience nothing short of of an intense and damning feeling that i may just very well be more suited for another profession instead. like law. or banking.sitting in the gym, bantering with a couple of the guys there while huffing and puffing for breath between killer drop sets of lateral raises and upright rows, discussing those horribly disgusting yuppie types who want and demand whatever they want, whenever they want, the goup suddenly arrives at the damning indictment that no future doctor wannabe should ever have the lethal triad of a tattoo, nipple piercing and bad attitude. which apparently i do.quote erat demonstrandum.i've never particularly enjoyed nor been very adept at studying, reading or memorising, really - the very that, rather unfortunately, most medical students and doctors ahve to do a LOT of. i've always enjoyed thinking, matching wits and arguing. i have rather awesome.. uhhh... oral talents (heh heh), as many who've seen me when i wanted to use them will readily attest to. and i like to strut. i walk with a constant cocky swagger. these are indeed the evry attributes that no good doctor should have, but apparently i do. in abundance, too.don't get me all wrong though. in many ways, i'd still love to be a doctor. a great one. yyou know, the kind of go from bed to bed, bringing joy and laughter and hope and healing to the patients under their care. the kind whom junior residents and insignificant medical students talk about in hushed tones and awed whispers. the kind who receive numerous awards for dedicted service/exemplary clinical practice/being an icon of beneficence in society and all that mumbo jumbo.and i'm not saying that i'll never be someone like that, because for the love of my two fragrant testicles and their ssociated recently-trimmed pubes, i have always, and will always be able to get whatever i so fucking want.all i'm saying is that definitely, probably, maybe, i would have found it easier and more natural in some other field. something more oral.

there was a huge ass motherfuker of a moth with a wingspan wider than the diameter of a good-sized elephant penis perched on the toilet wall last night. today, it is gone.this morning i felt something small and hard scuttling all over my foot. fearing that we were being invaded by the fearsome walking midget erectons from quontag-5, i glanced down, only to see a little scorpion-cricket-like insect thingy preparing to sink its pincers into my delicate and fragrant flesh. i crushed it with my shoe.i live in a veritable wildlife sanctuary.i also live in a den of vice and sin which is unbefitting for one aspiring to a place in the much-maligned medical profession. surrounded by alcohol and liquor, clouds of savoury cigarette smoke and enforced sloth and gluttony, i'm a living, walking, breathing example of all the evils that a man should avoid if he wishes to live till a hundred.i'm also a living, walking, breathing proponent of the school of thought that without all these little tasty tidbits and morsels of enjoyment, there's no point at all living till a hundred.posted by

every time i board a plane, whether it be for a potentially life-changing trip to the venue of a potentially life-changing interview or just a frivolous jaunt to some random holiday destination where 90 percent of the population carry exotic colourful STDs, i like to have an aisle seat. it's so much easier to get up and go tot eh toilet to pee pee or poo poo, there isn't the intense piercing discomfort of being wedged between two large hairy flatulent individuals while in the middle seat, and you don't have to wait forever and a day for your turn to disembark like the poor buggers in the window seats.plus, sometimes, if you happen to be a broad-shouldered individual, the air stewardesses tend to brush against your shoulders or arms with their perky pert perfumed asses as they sashay down the aisles.at least, that's what my friends tell me. i swear. *nonchalant whistle*in other news, at the risk of sounding smug (which i am) and arrogant (which i'm not; i'm just cocky) and perhaps even rather self-satisfied (again, i'm not; i'm extremely dissatisfied with life), i wold just like to say that loud vulgar and uncouth as i may be, i really am much more mature intelligent than the vast majority of people out there. and by "vast majority" read "almost everyone".in yet other news, the sheer insolence and lack of self-awareness that certain people possess astounds me. you'd think that i'd be pretty much the pinnacle of all kuailan-ness, but nooooooo. some people, who shall not be named, not because i respect their privacy but more because it just sounds fucking cooler to not name them, have actually published a book! a book on love! and dating! and the hows and whys and ins and outs of it all! when one of the authors has had only one girlfriend, and the other two have extensive experience "talking and discussing about relationship issues".everybody together now. oooooooooooooooh aaaaaaaaaaaaaah. fucktards eggtarts stupids retards! hohoho.i mean, honestly. it's one thing to be dumb and thick-skinned enough to even try to tell others how to ru their lives. its another thing to even hold a seminar to "enlighten" everyone. and it must indeed the peak of stupidity and idiocy and many other things which can only be described using adjectives unsuitable for public viewing when the 3 in question don't even goddamn fucking realise how strange and screwed up and self-absorbed they are.gah.i'm a happy kid you know. i really am.posted by

you know what i like about island life? the warm, reinvigorating sun, and the fresh, cool air, carrying with it a hint of the salty scent of the sea.everybody say it togetehr with me now. the warm reinvigorating sun and the fresh cool air. the warm reinvigorating sun and the fresh cool air. the warm reinvigorating sun and the fresh cool air.do you know what happens when the haze, blown over from indonesia, after making an intrepid journey across the straits of malacca, settles above the little island that you call home? that's right. no more warm reinvigorating sun, no more fresh cool air.and what is our lovely daring responsible capable go-getting government doing to alleviate our woes? "citizens are advised to pray for a quick and speedy resolution to the situation." no fucking shit. i now call upon the grace of xulaxulamecombie, the botswanan goddess of freshly-shat manure and emaciated livestock to lay waste to the kingdom of indonesia. to clear our fair skies of the evil thrice-accursed smoke. and to cure hiccups adn excessive flatulence everywhere.i wanted to say something intelligent about this,, but it's late and my balls, itchy as they are, need to be scratched.posted by

i swear, i seriously honestly sincerely swear on the watery maritime grave of my late pet turtle james who wa ceremoniously cast adrift at sea in a small light-blue tub, that i ahd nothing but the most noble, serious intention to buckle down and get some good old-fashioned hot sweaty heavy studying done tonight, but as usual the universe and the fates themselves conspired to thwart all that's good and noble, and i find myself staring mesmerised by the bright hypnotic glare of my 15-inch lcd laptop monitor.and it's not that there's an exotic bootleg porn clip of two voluptous polish twin sisters getting down and dirty with a green metal strap-on, peanut butter and a sprig of parsley. no sirree, the reason i find myself in this most dire of predicaments is because
- everybody sit downa dn take a deep breath here - i can't think of anything that i want to study.not that there's nothing that should be studied, nor is it that i know everything so damn bloody fucking well that i don't have to study, but because i don't seem to be able to find within myself the tiniest impetus to pick any single one of the bewildering array of diseases to read up on.you know what? this seemed like a waaaaaay better reason for enforced sloth before i actually made this valiant yet futile attempt to put it inot words.today, i found myself cringing at the incredibly gay effeminate mannerisms of a certain lecturer who shall not be named. for the love of all things holy, from doughnuts to vaginas, a man who wears a silver metal watch with a GODDAMN BRIGHT FLUORESCENT PINK face is NOT heterosexual by definition.posted by

i spend a lot of my free time thinking, brooding, ruminating any or all of the uncountable things in life that fill me with dread, anger, rage, despair, cynicism and/or frustration in varying measures - partly because i have nothing better to do, partly (or, as i sometimes suspect, mostly) because i secretly rather enjoy the secret heady thrill of having pure unadulterated negativity rushing through my veins , and partly because i'm a pessimistic cynical angy bastard by nature.but today,even as all of the above encircle me languidly, whispering enticingly seductive blandishments into my ear, i shall write about something else.there are very few things of which i am truly proud. or rather, make that "there are many things of which i am not proud". i'm not proud of how i've slowly shut myself off to everyone, even the ones who know me best. or maybe, especially them. i'm not proud of my pride. i'm not proud of the pathological inborn defect that prevents me from acting like the bastard i sometimes wish i could be, even if only for the short-lived superficial pleasures that would provide me access to.but i am proud of what i'm doing in life, and god-bloody-motherfuckingly proud at that. ladies and gentlemen, barring any unforeseen and extremely devastating fuckups, i am fucking proud
of my future profession. doctor, physician, healer, carer of the sick, helper of the hurt, friend of the suffering, no matter how you choose to look at it, no matter how many dodgy murky ethical issues dog the modern-day practice of medicine, i'm so damn fucking proud that (in theory at least), i chose, i want, to spend the rest of my life doing something for other people, and at the same time, doing it for myself.and just shut the fuck up if you think that we're a bunch of overpaid, under-skilled morons. because, in actual fact, we are a bunch of underpaid, under-skilled morons. yes, you read that right. we graduate knowing jackshit, but that's just the way it has to be. how long before an accountant can reeeeeaaally work on his or her own? training period required, correct? despite all those years slogging away and obtaining their degrees. well here's the news bozo, it's the same for us over here in healthcare except that mistakes tend to end in death of disfigurement, not merely someone scratching hisher head, muttering angrily and sending it back down for corrections. it comes with the territory. your chances of dying are still higher if you stayed away form the hospital than if you come in. that's the bright side folks. hurrah.so the next time someone out there feels the need to moan and groan and criticise some poor junior doctor, remember that we're just doing our jobs, and we're not even getting fucking paid well for it. the next time one of you uneducated wannabe fucktards feels like bitching about how we earn so much, remember the following: 1. we don't. 2. we spent tonnes of cash just learning our way to where we are. 3. actors, singers, sportsmen, bankers and other useless un-functional characters of odubtful moral character earn far more than us for doing things far less good and beneficial to mankind, so just layt he fuck off. 4. i'm sure that, all other things being equal, you'd like your doctor to be happy. complaining pisses us off. pissing us (or me) off may possibly conceivably result in painful iv cannulation, blood-taking, unnecessarry catheterisations just to strip you of your dignity and bone marrow biopsies performed without a trace of anaesthetic just for baseline monitoring.and i know, i know, aren't i always the one bitching about how life sucks, how we're not paid enough how it's not too late for me to jump ship and go into banking, how that's really the only intelligent option available, how i hate people, how i want everybody to die long drawn-out painful deaths because i'm a sick perverted dickhead. but really, honestly, i'm glad that at the very very very plumbing-the-depths least, i can always walk with a swagger, toss my hair back and proclaim that i fucking made a diference to that one person over there. at least i'll be doing something to help make someone better and hopefully even happier.and don't any one of you forget it either.ps: i still think we're treated shittily by society, that we're underpaid and overworked, adn that it's a thankless job, but hey, i really wouldnt trade it for the world. wait. ask me again next year when i actually hit the wards.posted by

you shake your head groggily and slam your hand down hard on the alarm, and realise that the reason no one loves you is because you're so angry and negative, and the reason you're so angry and negative is because no one loves you. and that's when you realise that you may have a teeny tiny bit of a problem there.goddamnit but i swear on the freshly laid turd of a three-headed spotetd hyena having her first menses that it's harder writing in the second person than it looks. or sounds. or wait. looks. hmmmm.anyway.i've surprised myself by enjoying my infectious disease posting far more than i thought i would. after all, boring medical specialty with not-so-good career prospects, slow paced as they come, many lectures on topics that'd been covered over and over and over again ad infinitum back in year 2 when i was still young, eager, enthusiastic, idealistic and alive. ah, way back then.what i'd forgotten about, however, was how way back then, microbiology was my favourite subject, antibiotics were my favourite part of the pharmacology module, and that i loved the way ID physicians had this nifty little knack of interweaving their lectures and talks with stories - both highly personal in nature, and those involving famous public figures and/or well-known historical events and episodes.and so i find myself having a bit of a blast, probably the first time ever while doing a medical posting. interesting lectures, intellectually stimulating discussions, fascinating narratives. okay, so maybe i exaggerate somewhat, but i really do find it rather fun. surprisingly so, at times.for perhaps the million-and-twenty-one-point-two-seventh time in the past few months, i find myself brooding moodily (is there any other kind of brooding? like brooding gleefully? or brooding sensually? or brooding merrily like a gay pixie transexual lap dancer?) on the myriad injustices i perceive in society, at the many stupid things that people think and that people do, and at how the fact that i'm constantly raging and seething while others aren't either means that i'm special - more sensitive and attuned to things around me, or that i'm just fucked in the head for caring about so many things that maybe shouldn't even be an issue at all.what i wouldn't do to be young and too stupid to know again.posted by

the boy scratched his head, feeling genuinely bemused for the first time in his life.he needed to talk. he wanted to talk. but the only people he trusted sufficiently to dole out good advice were part of the tangled and almsost anarchic web of confusion and uncertainty he found hiself entangled in.so he made a decision, thinking that at the very least, scars on the inside couldn't be seen easily by others. and what they couldn't see, they couldn't worry about.and thus it came to be, that he would be walking around, exsanguinating lusciously from a million horrendouly gaping wounds within, but hearty and hale and right as rain on the surface.and they all lived happily ever after.posted by
