Guillermo del Toro announced the development of Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark, a movie based on the successful trilogy of books written by Alvin Schwartz and illustrated by Stephen Gammell.
Deadline reported that John August wrote the script, and that del Toro could potentially direct. Plot details are obviously a secret.

omG sonny look horror wheezes!
Remembering one of Alan Rickman's final roles — a student project. To help refugees. →
upworthy:
So how does it work anyway? It’s simple, really. You watch the video, and that’s it.
The way it works is that the more views the video gets, the more advertising dollars its creator —OneClickGiving, a charity created by students at Oxford University — makes from YouTube. OneClickGiving then donates the ad revenue to Refugee Council and Save the Children. You are helping them raise that money — all just by watching a cute little video. Make sense?
Let’s honor Alan’s memory by raising money for a cause that was important to him. It counts for your daily dose of cute, too.

girl in the bar: *6 wings unfolding from her back as her body morphs into a conglomeration of lion’s heads covered in burning eyes* you will forget all you have seen *painless white holy fire sweeps across the bar, when the blinding light fades no one remembers a thing and she is gone*

Method actors like to talk about something called “public solitude” — that is, the ability to seem alone onstage. Really, to be alone, without wondering how you look to the audience. They will tell you this is the basis of naturalistic acting: to forget about the audience. Only then can you build a character, pay attention to others onstage and act out a scene.
To write a story also requires public solitude. You can’t be worrying how you sound. You can’t wonder whether you or your characters are likable or smart or interesting. You have to be inside the scene — the tactile world of tables and chairs and sunlight — attending to your characters, people who exist for you in nonvirtual reality. This takes weird brain chemistry. (A surprising number of novelists hear voice, and not metaphorically. They hear voice in their heads.) It also takes years of reading — solitary reading.
For all these reasons, writing fiction is pretty much the opposite of writing a good tweet, or curating an Instagram feed. It’s the opposite of the personal-­­­slash-professional writing that is now part of our everyday lives. More than ever, we need writers who are unprofessional, whose private worlds come first.
