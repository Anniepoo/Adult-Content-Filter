Iâ€™ll trade. You do the practice exam for the next couple of hours, and Iâ€™ll go to the beach!
Trust me, you wonâ€™t like the beach anyway. You get all sandy, thereâ€™s seaweed, probably sharksâ€¦Iâ€™m actually doing you a favor. No no, donâ€™t bother thanking me, itâ€™s nothing.
By the way, score over a 90.

Hey itâ€™s me.
With my tree.
At the end of the weeâ€¦.k.
Do you ever say out loud whatâ€™s in your head and then think, â€˜Today is one of those days where I should just talk to the dog?â€™

I went out last night with my good buds. I rarely see them right now between work and studying, so I organized the weekend to allow me a few hours free. The lot of them decided to start the evening with shotsâ€¦and we all know how evenings go when shots are poured. I was obviously not drinking and my one friend turned to me later and yelled, â€˜How can you put up with us when you are sober??â€™ I laughed and replied, â€˜What makes you think I need alcohol to find you delightful?â€™
I was quite lucky when I moved here to find this small group of wonderful people that can tease me about owning a girlcock and harness in the same sentence as asking me to spend a holiday with their family.
