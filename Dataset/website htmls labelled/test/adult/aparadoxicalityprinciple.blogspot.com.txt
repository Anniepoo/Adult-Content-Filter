To go buy buss
If tired of everything you see around you than you need a rest. You need a rest and change of sceneries and the best way for you to do the whole stuff is to leave this place and to go someplace else. And there are a number of ways for you to get there. But I guess the best way is to go there by buss. It is not just a place that is of great importance when looking for something new but it is also a road itself. When going somewhere you look through the window and see a number of faces and cities and everything there. And you will never get bored with those landscapes because those are shifted every second. And buss is the best way; buss is the best transport in this case. You can go together with your friends and sometimes there are too many of you to go there by car, but if it is a buss there could be as many of you as you want. Sure, you can never stop any time you want and go by something t drink, but you will have a great fun chatting with your friends while going. So, buss is not as fast and car and not as convenient but still buss is the greatest fun for trip.

Car is meaning of the life
Transport was made by people because they needed something to save the time for their travelling and this reason used to be the only reason. But, years have passed since that time and things are different now. Today, there are people who can’t imagine their lives without cars even if they now that those will give them no chance to save their time when driving to work or something. They are car-lovers and they are crazy about cars. They never buy those cars ads tell them to buy because they know for sure what the car is and which on is care for them. They choose the car like they choose their best friend and purchasing is not the last stage, it is just a beginning. They buy their cars and fall in love with them…well, they fall in love with cars at first and they buy them and after they did they modify them. They change almost everything outside and inside the car and they make it different from all other because car is like the second self for them. They are people with engine instead of cars and seems like they will die the very moment you take their cars away.

Transport: From Point A to Point B
Transport options have changed the world drastically in the past centuries, and not everybody would call it for the better. With more places to go than ever before, we’re in a dreadful hurry to get there so much that we hardly notice the journey. We can experience all kinds of different cultures, but may lose our own selves along the way. The world has become so fast that we sacrifice a bit of relaxation in order to get things done quicker, which may be a good thing, since we’re polluting the earth so fast that we’re running out of time to enjoy it. The increased possibilities of transport certainly have their advantages, but there are drawbacks as well, which many are beginning to see. When the railroads were first built, many poets bemoaned the tarnished landscape. What would they say about our highways? The landscape is certainly destroyed with cars and parking lots everywhere you look. The advantages, though, are fairly clear. Transport has allowed for economic growth and for many luxuries otherwise unavailable. People can travel easier and experience new places and different ideas without having to leave home forever. We’ve become accustomed to the luxuries of modern transport as well as the fast-paced lifestyle we’ve built up around it. Now, though, the whole system comes under question again. Is it ethical to fly on an airplane? Or to eat imported kiwis in the middle of January? All these luxuries we took for granted are being considered at a much deeper level, and the perils of our modern transport system are called to account.

Transport Laws
The transport laws of the world are continuously changing and simply because you aren’t aware of them don't mean you aren’t obligated to oblige by them. When many of us were infants there were no such things as seatbelt laws or car seat laws, but as safety concerns for children grew, the transport laws regarding children changed dramatically in just a few short years. The same applies to the transport laws of today. Especially if you are traveling abroad you need to be aware of the current transport laws and be sure to adhere to them.There are many transport laws that may seem to be out of touch with reality, but the laws are there just the same. For instance, in California, if someone leaps out in front of your car on a suicide mission and you hit them, the law states that you are still responsible for their death. It seems like just one of the many transport laws that requires reworking as there is not much you can do to avoid the jumper on the overpass who decides to leap on your car. Nevertheless, being aware of the transport laws can help you stay in a neutral position should something unfortunate happen.As more transport laws continue to change, more people need to be aware of the changes. Our world is growing smaller and a driver’s license from the United States, Canada, or European countries can be interchanged with other driver’s licensing laws. This means you don’t have to take a test on local transport laws in order to rent a car in a foreign country but you will still be held liable for any violations that may occur.
