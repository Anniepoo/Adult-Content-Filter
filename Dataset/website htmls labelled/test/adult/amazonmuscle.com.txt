Of course, both male and female body comprises of same muscle group and both have about 6000 muscles in their respective body.
In spite of this, women body cannot produce same level of muscle as that of men. This is because of the role of testosterone which is a steroid hormone and it plays a vital role in body growth, bone mass and formation of muscle.
