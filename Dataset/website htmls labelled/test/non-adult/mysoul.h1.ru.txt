Robert
"I loved being a part of your site. It was friendly, accessible and I felt it was much less of a cattle market than some other sites'"
Alison
"I love your website, it's so friendly and easy to use plus you get a real insight of the people who are on it, a great concept."
Rachael
"Fab site and the most genuine of all the dating sites! Great customer service! So fast and friendly!"
Paul
"I love the way that friends write the profiles, it's more helpful to read what the friends say, than people themselves."
Karen

Joanna
"I'll send Sarah Beeny a piece of wedding cake as a thank you!!!!"
Andrew

Nick
"Great idea for a dating site - you feel less strange as you don't have to sell yourself, your friend does it for you!"
Gita
"I was initially sceptical about internet dating, but I found a great guy. We've been together for more than three months now and it's all going well, thanks very much!"
Lynne
"If you're thinking about joining STOP and DO IT NOW best thing I ever did, now the happiest man in the world!!!!!"
Nick
"Very good website and better than most, with family/friends reviewing a person you are getting in touch with - an original idea which helped me meet someone very special.
Philip
"Fantastic, I'd have never joined up to online dating if it wasn't for a friend of mine who set me up on your site. It's such a great idea. I've never been a fan of writing about myself or trying to 'big' myself up......I just let my friend do it for me!"
Andrew
"I was not expecting to meet anyone, my friends persuaded me to give it a go and it all feels very surreal because I have found an amazing man I now call my boyfriend!"
Vicky
"It works, but sometimes takes a while. Keep trying, never give up. The site is full of hotties!"
Daniel
"Great news, through MSF I met my now fiancée Polly, two years ago. We are getting married in a month's time. Was very impressed with the site"
Chris
"I met a total hunk on MSF, very true to his profile and one of the most gentlemanly men I have ever met! Forget chancing meeting a nice guy on a night out, life is too short to play a waiting game! It could be your turn next!!!!"
Amanda
"Well worth the effort - glad I finally listened to my friends' advice! if you are looking for love, try this site- you have nothing to lose! good luck!"

Why mysinglefriend.com is different...
There's no cringey profile writing, because we believe that your friends know you best - so they write your profile for you! Just like having a virtual wingman by your side, it takes the hassle and stigma out of dating and paints a better picture of you as a person. Your friends can even recommend other singles on the site to you, and it doesn't matter who starts the process - your friend can add you, or you can join up and simply give us your friend's email address.
MySingleFriend was founded in 2004 by TV presenter and property extraordinaire Sarah Beeny, who is notorious for setting her single friends up. She had the ingenious idea of being able to describe all her single friends online. Since then we've had amazing feedback from our site members and hundreds of happy couples who are getting hitched, thanks to meeting on MSF!
