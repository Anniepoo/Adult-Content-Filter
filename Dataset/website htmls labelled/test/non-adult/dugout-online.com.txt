Welcome to Dugout-Online, free online football manager game
Dugout-Online is a football manager game where you take charge of a small and unknown club.
Your goal is to bring that club to the top and win the World champions' cup! It won't be easy though,
and you'll have to use your management, trading and tactical skills to the best of your ability if you want to
stand a chance amongst thousands of other managers from all over the world. The game is actually never-ending,
so all the data is passed from the season to the season. If, for example, you win a title in some lower
division, your club gets promoted to a higher one, if you win a cup then you'll be defending the title next season and so on.

...we would like to warn you about a few things that proved to be a common downfall for a lot of new managers. Two of the probably most important things the new manager should do are the following:
1.Read the guide for new football managers
If you want to start climbing towards the stardom without learning a hard lesson
or two, then we strongly suggest you read the guide for new managers, where
all the common traps that resulted in downfall of many new managers are listed and explained.
2.Read the rules!
We just cannot stress enough how important this is! There are not a lot of rules anyway, but
you need to obey them because otherwise you can find yourself in trouble.
If you break any of the rules, you can find your club financially
fined, reset(you need to start from the beginning) or (in worst case) you can even get thrown out of the game!
Please note that the interpretation of the rules, type (and amount) of fines, decisions to ban managers
and all other things directly or indirectly linked to the rules are solely in the domain
of the game administrators that are making sure the game is fair for every manager involved!
