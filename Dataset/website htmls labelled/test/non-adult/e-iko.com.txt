How to get rid of man boobs… not a topic any man wants to bring up, especially when it’s about them.
I recently had to ask myself the same question. There is a shocking amount of men  struggling today with their man boobs.
It’s a constant struggle to feel comfortable in your own skin when you always feel that you have to hide your chest.
It’s especially difficult for you to be intimate with your partner when you feel self conscious about your body.
Before we talk about how to get rid of man boobs, lets go over what causes them…
What Causes Man Boobs
There are two reasons men grow breast.
The first reason is due to your body fat percentage being high, causing a build up of fatty tissue anywhere on your body. In this case… your breast.
The second reason is hormones… I know, who thought hormones would effect a mans breast size!
Basically your body starts producing less testosterone and more estrogen… which is the same hormone a female produces that makes them a female.
Now that you know what causes manboobs, lets go over your options.
How to Get Rid of Man Boobs Fast
There are a few options to help you figure out how to lose man boobs.
Diet and exercise – watching what you eat and doing cardio as well as anaerobic exercises are a great way to give your chest a work out to reduce the fatty tissue build up.
Herbal Remedies – Green tea is great for burning fat. Studies showed that people who drink green tea on a regular basis actually burn fat faster then people who don’t. Flax oil will help you decrease any flab on your chest by helping you eat less, it acts as a mild appetite suppressant.
Surgery – If your manboobs developed from a hormonal change in your body then gynecomastia surgery is an option for you. It’s the best way to get rid of man boobs fast, but it comes at a high cost. The average price of this surgery is around $3,000… for me that is a little steep!
Supplements – there are supplements available that are non prescription and are geared to target the fatty tissue around a mans breast.
Option number 1, diet and exercise, sounds good if you have time to go to the gym and track everything you eat. I can find a little time to go to the gym and somewhat what what I eat but I don’t think that will give me the results I want since I really need to know how to get rid of man boobs fast… not if & when I have time.
Option number 2, Herbal Remedies, I think are great for those looking for the most natural way but I still think that would take time and a lot of supplements contain herbal ingredients plus other ingredients to speed up your results.
Option number 3, Surgery, sounds good if you have the money and are willing to go the most invasive route… but financially and emotionally not for everyone.
Option number 4, Supplements, this option sounds like the most realistic option for me, and probably most men suffering from moobs would agree. Supplements will get me the results I’m looking for the fastest, and at an affordable price.
Let’s look at the top supplements that are available over the counter and through process of elimination find the best one for us.
Top 3 Supplements for Reducing Man Breasts
Supplement #3: Gynexin
This supplement claims to work by targeting fatty cells in your memory glands. The company also says that the formula was developed by top leading nutritionist in the field.
Now, that all sounds great except when you read the small print.
Each bottle contains 60 capsules, and you take up to 4 a day, if you do the math that means one bottle will last you two weeks. At a price of $70 per bottle, that’s a total of $140 per month. I don’t know about you, but that’s a little steep for me. I don’t mind spending the money if I’m 100% positive that the supplement will work.
So to figure out if this supplement will work I did some research and read some reviews. I was able to quickly eliminate this supplement as an option after reading the first few reviews I could find.
Firstly, you can buy this on Amazon which tells you that anyone can sell it and causes me to not trust the product, it’s kind of like you never know what you’re going to get in the bottle if you buy on Amazon.
Secondly, the reviews are absolutely horrible. Almost all the customer reviews gave it an average rating of 1 to 2 stars. They said that the product was a scam and it didn’t do anything for them.
For obvious reasons let’s discuss supplement number two…
Supplement #2: GyneMax
This supplement will supposedly boost your energy to increase the burning of fatty tissue around your chest. It has ingredients that have the same effect as green tea.
What made me skeptical about this supplement is the company’s sales page. It was full of what I like to call “fluff” in regards to content and reviews. It immediately made me not trust the company.
What made me eliminate this product in the end was, once again, the fact that I could buy it on Amazon. Not only could I buy it on Amazon, but I can see all the honest reviews from past consumers.
These reviews all made the same claim as Gynexin. Not only did the product do nothing for them, but the green tea left them with a very jittery feeling all day which caused them to experience bad insomnia.
Since I would like to see results and I enjoy my sleep, I moved on next supplement.
Supplement #1: Gynectrol
This supplement is truly made up of all-natural ingredients, without the negative side effects.
It specifically targets the fatty tissue around your chest by triggering the process of lipolysis. Lipolysis is the breakdown of lipids and fats by hydrolysis to release fatty acids.
Another ingredient is Chromium, which also helps burn fat and build muscle. Another great active ingredient is green tea, but this formula doesn’t give you jitters or insomnia.
Another point to make is that each bottle contains 60 tablets, and since the recommended dosage is one tablet twice a day that means that one bottle will last you an entire month.
My final point to make is that you can’t find this product on Amazon and all the reviews I have found are positive.
The company even has an amazing offer, when you buy a two month supply you get one month free. They also offer free shipping to the US and UK, as well as flat rate shipping internationally. Another reason to trust this company is they offer a safeguard guarantee.
