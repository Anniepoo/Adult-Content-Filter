Four Ways to Say No (Opt out)
Download opt-out cookies. This
is a process that usually involves clicking on a button to download the opt-out
cookie. To do this, you go to the marketer's Web site, find the privacy policy,
then find the "opt out" information. The cookie your computer will
get tells the company not to track you anymore. Yes, it is a little bit of extra
work to click on the links. See the "More About Opt Out Cookies" section
below for more information.
Use the cookie management tools in your Web browser.
Also, use cookie management
tools to be selective in what long-term cookies you accept. In the newest versions
of most web browsers, you can set your browser to accept only session cookies,
or to turn all cookies into session cookies. Session cookies are generally harmless.
For Macintosh Safari users, you can tell the browser to only accept cookies
from "the site you are navigating to." This means that you will not
accept third party cookies. To explore what cookie settings are available to
you, look in the "preferences" or "options" section of your
browser's menu.
View current cookies and delete what you don't need.
Most Web browsers allow
you to see what cookies you already have stored. You may have thousands of cookies
if you are like many Web surfers. Some cookies, such as registration cookies
for Web sites you visit frequently, are useful to keep around. But other cookies,
like tracking cookies from atdmt.com, doubleclick.net, 2o7.net, atwola.com,
and other advertisers aren't necessarily helpful to you. Delete the cookies
you don't need, and do a periodic check every couple of months to weed out your
cookie folder.
Check your account preferences on registration sites. Some sites, such as
eBay, require registration and the use of cookies. On eBay, for example, if
you do not opt-out of advertising tracking, information about your eBay activities
can be used by other sites and advertisers outside of eBay. EBay discloses this
in its privacy policy. However, using your account preferences, you can opt-out
of this kind of tracking. In this case, you are not downloading an opt-out cookie,
you are setting a preference on a site where you have registration information.
For more information: the World Privacy Forum published a report about various
kinds of online tracking cookies as part of its testimony about behavioral advertising
to the Federal Trade Commission. That report discusses opt out cookies (see
below), and it also discusses rarer kinds of cookies such as Flash Cookies,
Silverlight Cookies, and others. The report is located here: http://www.worldprivacyforum.org/pdf/WPF_NAI_report_Nov2_2007fs.pdf.
