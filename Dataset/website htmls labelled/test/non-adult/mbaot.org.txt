Welcome to the Mortgage Bankers Association of Tallahassee web site!
Our association is composed of companies involved in residential lending in Northwest Florida. Our members include banks, credit unions, mortgage bankers, mortgage brokers, appraisal firms, credit bureaus, settlement agents, private mortgage insurance companies and Fannie Mae.
The association encourages its members to adhere to sound business practices and methods in originating, marketing and servicing of real estate mortgage loans. As to standards of conduct in dealing with the public, members are also encouraged to help protect the public against fraud, misrepresentation or unethical practices in the mortgage field.
Our association recognizes that today’s mortgage consumers seek accurate and straightforward information. We have assembled information on our web site which we believe will help educate consumers about the various aspects of mortgage financing.
