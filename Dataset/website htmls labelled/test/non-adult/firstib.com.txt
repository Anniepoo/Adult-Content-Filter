Q
Can I really bank without branches?
Yes! First Internet Bank is a pioneer in the “direct banking” model. We’ve been around since 1999, and our thousands of customers across the country have discovered the benefits of banking without branches. Chances are, with direct deposit and ATMs, you probably don’t visit bank branches that often anyway… so why pay for something you don’t use? Without a costly branch network, we pass our savings on to you in the form of great rates and low fees. We’ve loaded up our online banking site with tools and resources to help you manage your money more easily and make smart financial choices for your future. When you have a question, an experienced Banking Specialist is here to help – by phone, email or online chat.
Q
What Commercial Banking services does First IB provide?
First IB Commercial Banking offers new and refinanced working capital lines of credit, equipment loans, acquisition/expansion loans, owner-occupied and investment commercial real estate loans, SBA loans and commercial credit cards. Our experienced Commercial Relationship Bankers can offer flexible loan structures that are tailored to your company’s needs. Our treasury management product suite includes commercial online banking, ACH and wire origination, sweep and zero balance accounts, remote deposit capture and commercial mobile banking. First IB offers real-time processing of all transactions which means no delays on inter-account transfers and debit and credit transactions.
Q
How quickly can you close my mortgage?
First IB can typically close home purchase mortgages and refinance transactions in 30 days or less. Our experienced loan team will work with you to identify the documents we will need to meet your closing date.
The time to close may vary depending on property and borrower circumstances. Be sure to speak with one of our experienced loan officers about your specific situation.
Q
Can I apply for a mortgage loan before I find a home to purchase?
Yes, applying for a mortgage loan before you find a home may be the best thing you could do! If you apply now you could pre-qualify online in minutes. Or, take it a step further, and we will review requested documentation in order to issue an official pre-approval. You can use the pre-approval letter to assure real estate brokers and sellers that you are a qualified buyer. A mortgage pre-approval helps give more weight to any offer that you make.
Q
How do I make deposits to my personal account?
In today’s wireless world, you no longer have to make deposits in person. First IB offers multiple ways to deposit your funds. Learn more in this brief video.
