Copyright © 2014 El Dorado Savings Bank
El Dorado Savings Bank was established in Placerville in 1957 to offer
competitive savings programs to local residents while promoting home ownership
through construction, purchase and refinance loans.   As El Dorado expanded its
operations over the years, the bank remained faithful to these original
principles by developing new loan and savings products, while adding service
delivery channels with ATM’s, telephone banking and Internet banking.   more
