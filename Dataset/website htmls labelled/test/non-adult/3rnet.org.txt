Happy New Year! Our 2015 Recap
2015 was another busy year for 3RNet! Here’s a recap of some big accomplishments we saw over the past year.
Arizona: Partnering Toward Success
It's always great to hear when our members work closely with other organizations in their states who share our mission. One example of an outstanding partnership comes from our member in Arizona. We spent some time with the three entities that work together in the Grand Canyon state to find out more about the importance of partnering.
