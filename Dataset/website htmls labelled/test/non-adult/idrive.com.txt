IDrive – Your Data is Stored Forever!
January 14, 2016
Businesses have ceaselessly battled to defend data losses. With frequent data loss experiences in the past, businesses have coped up with backing up their data more assertively than before. The outcome is the realization that there is no fail-safe solution to protect your data from disasters! The most businesses could do is to back them up to an offsite location, to avail in case of a disaster. By doing so, data loss from disasters can be prevented as a copy of the data is saved offsite.
Cloud solutions have boomed in the market during the last decade with its good offerings. Cloud service also has picked its place in businesses due to simplicity and affordability. But there’s a lot that you must be considering when choosing a cloud solution as your data matters most for your business!
Imagine that your data is deleted from your devices, but not backed up for quite a long, and you want the lost data recovered. How can you fetch the data that is not backed up for a long time? The answer is, there is very little or no chance! But if your data was once backed up with IDrive, you can be sure about recovering it. True Archiving in IDrive ensures that your files that are sent once to your cloud account, stays there as long as your account is alive. With us, even if you accidentally or intentionally remove a file from your computer, it will always remain on the cloud. This means, unless you don’t manually delete files or use the automated Archive Cleanup process, you'll always have access to your files.
What is Archive Cleanup?
Archive cleanup is a feature on your IDrive application, with which you can delete files from your cloud account. The ‘archive cleanup’ option, compares the files of your cloud account to the existing files that you have chosen for protection, and then deletes the ones present in your cloud and not on your file transfer set. This feature is great to free up space in your account.
Your Data is Secure with Us
IDrive has the best-in-class security. Your files are encrypted during transfer and storage, using military grade 256-bit AES encryption. IDrive also offers the option of private key encryption, wherein the encryption key is defined by you and not stored anywhere on IDrive servers, ensuring only you can access your backed up files. Not just that, your data is stored in our data center with world-class facilities like, smoke detection, fire suppression systems, motion sensors, 24/7 secured access, video camera surveillance and security breach alarms.
What IDrive Offers?
All-to-one Protection
You can protect data from unlimited PCs, Macs, iPhones, iPads and Android devices into a single account. It doesn’t matter how many devices you own, IDrive makes backing them easier to one account, at one price. Unlike other cloud services that charge per computer or device, IDrive securely protects data from any number of devices into one cloud account, for one low fee.
Server Protection without Downtime
You can secure data from running databases and servers - MS SQL Server, MS Exchange Server, VMware, Hyper-V, MS SharePoint Server, Oracle Server and Linux Servers, without suspending them. This means, you have an interruption-free operation while backing up your data, ensuring efficiency with no downtime.
Save Data Locally and On Cloud
You can store your files locally and to the cloud. Local feature is a perfect complement to your cloud storage by enabling you to locally store your important files to IDrive Wi-Fi - a storage device that combines the security of cloud and the convenience of local connectivity. Your data is encrypted and stored locally (IDrive Wi-Fi) and on cloud. Local storage helps speedy recovery of your data when compared to cloud!
Multiple File Versions
All the files backed up previously to your cloud account can be retained. You can restore 10 previous file versions to any location on your local computer. The additional storage for the previous versions has no impact on your account's quota, as your storage is calculated only for the most current version.
Securely Share Files and Folders
You can transfer all your data to your cloud account and then safely share files, using a single secure link. With an edit option, your recipients can access your files, make changes and upload them back to the account. You can share files from your computer, mobile device or via the web.
