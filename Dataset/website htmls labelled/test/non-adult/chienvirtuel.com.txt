New Horizon: Architecture from Ireland
October 3, 2015–January 30, 2016
The Chicago Design Museum and Irish Design (ID2015) present New Horizon: Architecture from Ireland as an Affiliate Program Partner of the Chicago Architecture Biennial. New Horizon represents an international extension of a year-long initiative backed by the Irish government exploring, promoting and celebrating Irish design throughout Ireland and internationally. New Horizon features installations by ten dynamic emerging architecture practices from Ireland across three global partner cities: London, Chicago and Shenzhen.
In the gallery of the Chicago Design Museum, three Dublin-based firms—A2 Architects, GKMP Architects, and Ryan Kennihan—create an intervention, part installation, part exhibition. The design concept pays tribute to Chicago’s famous grid system established by Daniel Burnham in the Plan of Chicago and the world famous architecture of Mies van der Rohe. The physical expression of the installation features a mirrored ceiling that visually extends a supporting grid of i-beams out to infinity. A large communal table—inspired by traditional decorative arts of Ireland—showcases the work of each firm via stories, models, drawings and photographs.
