Meet the man behind eHarmony
Dr. Neil Clark Warren, Founder
Dr. Warren is a clinical psychologist and author of eight books on love, marriage and
emotional health. During 35 years of counseling thousands of married couples, Dr. Warren
observed a set of characteristics that seemed to be present in all successful relationships.
He called them the 29 Dimensions of Compatibility. After extensive research involving
thousands of married couples, Dr. Warren confirmed that these dimensions were indeed
highly predictive of relationship success and could be used to match singles. Ten years
later, eHarmony's compatibility matching is responsible for nearly 4% of U.S. marriages.*
*2012 U.S. survey conducted for eHarmony by Harris Interactive®
eHarmony - #1 Trusted Online Dating Site for Singles
eHarmony is the first service within the online dating industry to use a scientific approach to matching highly compatible singles. eHarmony's matching is based on using its 29 DIMENSIONS® model to match couples based on features of compatibility found in thousands of successful relationships.
eHarmony is committed to helping singles find love every day, and with over 20 million registered online users, we are confident in our ability to do so. The eHarmony Compatibility Matching System® matches single women and men based on 29 Dimensions® of Compatibility for lasting and fulfilling relationships.
Traditional Internet dating can be challenging for those singles looking for love that lasts. But eHarmony is not a traditional dating site. Of all the single men or women you may meet online, very few will be compatible with you specifically, and it can be difficult to determine the level of compatibility of a potential partner through methods of conventional dating services – browsing classified ads, online personals, or viewing profile photos. Our Compatibility Matching System does the work for you by narrowing the field from thousands of single prospects to match you with a select group of compatible matches with whom you can build a quality relationship.

Because of this, we are committed to assisting singles everywhere in their search to find love and romantic fulfillment.
