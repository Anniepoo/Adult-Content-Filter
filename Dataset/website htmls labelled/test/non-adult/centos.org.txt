The CentOS Project
The CentOS Project is a community-driven free software effort focused on delivering a robust open source ecosystem. For users, we offer a consistent manageable platform that suits a wide variety of deployments. For open source communities, we offer a solid, predictable base to build upon, along with extensive resources to build, test, release, and maintain their code.
We’re also expanding the availability of CentOS images across a number of vendors, providing official images for Amazon, Google, and more. For self-hosted cloud, we also provide a generic cloud-init enabled image.
For more information about updates and improvements in CentOS 7, please check out the release notes or the release announcement in the mailing list archive.
