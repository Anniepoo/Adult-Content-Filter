Tal Feigel, Campaign Manager Director, Marimedia
Adperium has been an invaluable partner since 2009 providing us with tools and support unmatched by any other network. The Direct Ads self-serve platform has given us a way to acquire traffic outside of our own network through an easy to use interface. The latest update brings increased functionality and a more
efficient workflow.
Jamie Dalgetty, VP Network Operations, Bootcamp Media
For more than 5 years, I am getting excellent results with my online campaigns at Adperium. The team is very responsive and efficient. This is a company I'm sure I'll do business with for many years to come.
Oren Mizrav, Director of Ad Operations, Musiclab
It's always our greatest pleasure to work with Adperium! Unlike their competitors, everyone we are in contact with is competent and feature requests we have, are actually getting done. Furthermore, they have the most competitive prices on both sides, buying & selling and we appreciate that they are always taking efforts for innovation. Adperiums' professionalism should be a leading standard for the industry and we sincerely believe that all of our advertisement needs are met and taken seriously here.
