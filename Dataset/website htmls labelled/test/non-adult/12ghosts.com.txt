What others say
"Thanks for 12Ghosts Quick and friendly responses.
It's
so rare in this age of megacorporations." (Simon Essex)
"I routinely deal (or try to deal) with many vendors via email as part of my job & that you respond at all puts you furlongs ahead of most of the crowd. The fact you respond quickly, consistently and with intelligence is essentially unheard of!" (Keith Sherk)
"I've recently evaluated and then bought 12Ghosts Complete. It's a remarkable set of utilities. It replaces several programs I had before as it does comparable functions very easily. Congratulations." (John Godfrey)
"As I test hundreds of software programmes and utilities, my system is often on the blink, but 12Ghosts never fails to work under these less than favourable conditions." (Rod Druce)
