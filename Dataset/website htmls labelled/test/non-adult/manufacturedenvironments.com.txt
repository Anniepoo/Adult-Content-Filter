Hey there! I’m Daniel, and here are a few of my amazing photos. Cameras featured include an iPhone 6, Canon EOS 700D with a 50mm f/1.4 lens and a Yashica-Mat LM (c. 1958).
I first shot square photos as a kid with my Polaroid 600 in the ‘80s. But I fell in love with the format in the ‘90s when my father passed down his Yashica-Mat LM. It’s a 6x6 TLR (twin lens reflex), and it's totally badass.
