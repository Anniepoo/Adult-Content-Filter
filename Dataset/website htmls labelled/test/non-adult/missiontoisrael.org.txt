An Open Response to Martin Selbrede and Archie Jones’ ‘Book Review’ of Bible Law vs. the United States Constitution: The Christian Perspective
Open letter addressing objections brought up in a Chalcedon book review.
Excerpted from An Open Response to Martin Selbrede and Archie Jones’ ‘Book Review’ of Bible Law vs. the United States Constitution: The Christian Perspective:
Dear Mr. Selbrede and Mr. Jones,
I feel honored you considered Bible Law vs. the United States Constitution weighty enough to review in the Chalcedon magazine Faith for All Life, although I would have preferred a more accurate review. With that said, I would like to comment on some of your points. After you have read my response, I hope you will view the book and this entire issue in a different light. READ MORE

HAILING KINGDOM AMBASSADORS
An Open Letter From Ted R. Weiland
Dear Brethren,
My preaching and writing about the U.S. Constitution has not been about exposing the Constitution so much as it has been about promoting Yahweh’s law and advancing His kingdom. Following salvation and personal discipleship, these two issues should be paramount in everything we do as Christians.
We have been called to be ambassadors of Yahweh and His kingdom (2 Corinthians 5:20). Consequently, we need to move beyond merely the understanding that Yahweh’s kingdom and laws are integral to the New Covenant (Colossians 1:12-13, Hebrews 8:8-10). We need to move into action and start taking some ground on behalf of our King.
One of the key battles for the kingdom at this time is being waged on the Internet. Others and I are posting Scriptural responses on prominent conservative, patriot, Tea Party, and Christian blogs (see below). I hope you will join us in this exciting means of representing our Lord and Savior. The fields are white for harvesting (John 4:35). Several people have recently requested I create an email list of “kingdom ambassadors” like you, who would like to join this battle. Anytime I post on one of these sites, you will be notified so you can participate in and add weight to the discussion.
Email:
The following great idea comes by way of Dennis Woods and provides another means by which we can recruit more of our brethren into the battle for dominion (2 Corinthians 10:3-6).
Please prayerfully consider becoming a part of this project and help us make an impact for Yahweh’s kingdom!
Serving the KING of kings,
Ted R. Weiland
Tea Partyers, patriots, and Constitutionalists gather in two principal places: 1) offline at monthly Tea Party and other patriot meetings and 2) online at favorite sites. As pronomians, seeking to promote the kingdom of Yahweh, we can engage them in both worlds. (See Mission to Israel’s Tea Party Project for assistance in engaging them at their meetings.) If you enjoy expressing your opinions in writing, Tea Party and Conservative blogs are another great platform from which to engage these folks and begin the process of challenging their thinking. Following is a starter list of Conservative/Tea Party/Christian Constitutional blogs:
The American View
American Vision
American Vision News
The Cameron Connection
Christian Constitutionalist Blog
Christian Liberty News
Conservative Byte
Constitutional Emergency
Daily Tea
Economics Mythbusters
Education Mythbusters
Freedom Outpost
George Barna
Godfather Politics
History Mythbusters
Last Resistance
The Liberty Crier
The Patriot Post
Political Outcast
Personal Liberty Digest
Politichicks
The President’s Desk
Providence Foundation
Renew America
Tea Party Economist
Vision to America
WorldNetDaily
World View Weekend
Zionica
Please add to this list and notify us when you do, so that we can update others involved.
If you choose to participate in this kingdom-promoting project, please abide by the following Top 10 “Rules of Engagement”:
Keep your comments as short as possible. Try to limit yourself to one paragraph, no more than two. Save some of your “ammunition” for whoever responds to your initial comment.
Reinforce other pronomian comments.
Be polite. Pretend you are sitting at a dinner table having a conversation across from the person(s) you’re engaging. This will help you assume the appropriate tone.
Try to be forthright without being confrontational.
Share at least one pertinent Bible verse.
If possible, try to also reinforce your comments with people that the conservative/Tea Party person respects such as Ron Paul, Patrick Henry, Ronald Reagan, Benjamin Franklin, etc. (Be careful with this one, as you do not want to appear as if you’re promoting the person himself, especially if he is antinomian, anti-kingdom, etc.)
Pick 5-10 sites to monitor for articles or discussions that provide a topic or theme to which you can respond with something from Yahweh’s law or with a link to a pronomian, kingdom-promoting article that addresses the subject matter in more detail. (See the Hot Topics page for subjects and links to articles available from Mission to Israel Ministry.)
Avoid the temptation to say everything at once. Select one point and address it well, leaving other points for other pronomians to pick up on.
Take it easy. There is a great temptation to “dump the truck” in response to some outrageous comment. Begin by looking for things you can agree with and be complimentary. Seek to gain credibility and respect over time.
Be a humble student. Ask questions that might provoke thought, e.g. “How is it possible for us to resist the Muslim invasion given the First Amendment as it stands?”
(Bottom Line: Remember Who you represent. “The Church is looking for better methods; God is looking for better men.”—E.M. Bounds)
Imagine the impact we could have if just 300 pronomian Christians were to take up this challenge and become faithful participants on a weekly basis on these targeted blog sites. Very quickly, the pronomian kingdom position would become the predominant position, which alone would prompt people to take it more seriously. This would be like Gideon’s band of 300 who routed tens of thousands of Midianites. Will you be one of Yahweh’s 300?
Perhaps at times we should publish a list of the “good-guy” sites as well, so our people could be building up traffic to these places when blogging on different topics. I’ve got a starter list of 11 in that Hall of Faith page on America Betrayed. For example, when talking about welfare replacements they could refer to the Love INC site. Or when talking about the Second Amendment, they could refer to Larry Pratt’s Gun Owners of America site. This would further encourage practical action toward kingdom rebuilding, beyond just politics.
Kingdom Bloggers, if you want to be part of “Yahweh’s 300” please email me, Dennis Woods, and I will keep you updated of our progress toward reaching the goal of 300 Kingdom bloggers.
Dennis Woods
