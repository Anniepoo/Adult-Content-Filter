Success stories
"i3 connected us to a corporate strategic that we did not have an established relationship with. That company is aligned with our technology focus and actively looking to partner with new companies. i3 also proved value in helping connect with the right person and the right department."
- Greg Jenkins, CEO, Ciris Energy
"i3 has been a huge help to NBD Nano. Because of i3 and Cleantech Group, NBD has been able to connect to several large corporate partners including General Motors and EDF. NBD is now in the testing / sample exchange phase with both companies and potentially moving into longer term research collaborations."
- Miguel Galvez, Co-Founder, NBD Nano
"Cleantech Group and the i3 network have been an invaluable asset for us. We're in talks with multiple investors right now and we have them to thank for it. we'll remember what Cleantech Group meant to us well past the funds we raise"
- Mark Walter, CEO, Biix
"Through our free i3 access as a start-up, we were able to connect with a prominent corporate venture capital team, which we'd tried previously to contact unsuccessfully. The corporate venturing team was then able to connect us with their business unit experts who already see great value in our technology. We are both very excited for the potential here, and are looking to try to move a partnership forward as soon as we can!"
- Sue Wang, Co-founder, AnCatt
