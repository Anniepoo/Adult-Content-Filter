Music theory for every musician!
InstruNOTE is a series of courses designed to teach PRACTICAL music theory from the ground up, from novice to lifetime performer, in 5 to 15 minutes a day.
Our courses incorporate proven memory techniques into a learning approach customized to each student on an individual basis, with reports and recommendations available for teachers to view at a glance.
Students receive review and new lessons when they’re ready for them, and as a result, the skills they learn are for life!
