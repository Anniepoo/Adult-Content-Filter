What is a KSA?  Knowledge, Skills and Abilities
... that list of special qualifications and personal attributes that someone has decided you should have in order to fill a particular job.
When
required, KSAs are the single most important aspect of your federal application and our
KSA Workbook will help
you understand and craft job-winning KSAs.

Not sure what a KSA looks like...how long they should be...what writing style is used.
Then take your KSA writing a step further - our KSA Sampler is loaded with over
75 sample KSA responses to help you avoid
"writer's block" and prepare clear and concise KSA statements.
Review our sample KSAs and identify those that, with the substitution of a few keywords, are similar to KSAs you
might encounter when applying for federal jobs.

Are you using your
private-sector resume to apply for federal jobs? If
you answered yes, let our experienced Federal Resume Writers help you tackle these
issues by converting your private-sector resume into a
'job winning'
federal-style resume, in both a presentation and
on-line format.
I
cannot thank you enough for the extra-ordinary
service I have experienced working with FRS.
Applying for federal jobs can be a nightmare
(preparing resumes, KSAs and the application
process) if one does not have the value added
service and guidance that is provided by FRS.
