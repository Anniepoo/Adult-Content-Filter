Get Paid to Help Radio Stations Play Better Music...From Your Computer!
ListenerPOWER Online™ is a Worldwide Research Company that is dedicated to improving the quality of radio entertainment based on what you tell us you like and dislike!
If you have already been invited to participate in a survey in progress, please feel free to browse the various pages above to see what you can expect.
"What's it Like" even has an example of a recent music survey. If you have already been invited to participate you are already registered, so no need to fill that out again but you can click on "Update Your Info" to be sure we have all your correct information.
The "Support" page has answers to many of the questions you may have while taking your survey, and the "Contact Us" page lets you email us with any general questions about ListenerPOWER Online.
If you would like to participate in an upcoming survey, just click here to register. When you register online, that tells us you would like us to contact you when a survey comes up in your area. If you qualify, we will send you a link to download the survey or, for longer studies, send a CD-ROM that you simply insert in your computer, login, listen to music and other audio content, and tell us how you feel. When you complete the survey you can discard the CD-ROM or remove the downloaded survey file... It's that simple!
Be assured that we will NEVER sell you anything..and NOTHING is ever installed, downloaded, or read on your computer!
All you need to participate is a computer and an internet connection, mouse, and speakers or a headset!
So register now and we will contact to let you know when we will be conducting an online survey in your city!
Again, if you have any problems or questions, please click on our support page or click here to contact us.
Thank you for your interest in joining our effort to help radio stations provide better programming!
