HAIR LOSS HEADWEAR
At Xazha we care about the impact a cancer diagnosis can have on a woman’s psyche. Apart from dealing with a life-changing event, you would still like to look beautiful and maintain some sense of femininity during and after chemotherapy. We are proud to present our range of hats, head scarves and accessories, carefully designed and meticulously crafted for women dealing with the side effects of hair loss from cancer, alopecia and various other medical conditions.
Our headwear is made from the finest silk and cotton fabrics, carefully assembled for maximum comfort, and offered in a range of stylish and contemporary designs. All of our hats, caps and head scarves are designed to provide full head coverage, so there is no need for additional liners or padding to conceal hair loss. All hand made with loving care in the UK.
We also stock an exciting range of headbands, brooches, corsages and jewellery to compliment your headwear for “that little something extra”. You can mix and match various items to create a unique effect that is entirely your own, and bring your whole outfit together.
As an online store, we strive to make the purchasing process as safe and easy as possible. We hope you enjoy browsing through our products, and feel confident you will find something that is right for you.
Thank you for visiting our website!
Xazha was inspired when a friend who was going through the hair loss side effects of chemo and was struggling to find something stylish and practical to wear.
