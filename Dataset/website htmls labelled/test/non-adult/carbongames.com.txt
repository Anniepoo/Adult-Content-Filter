New Networking Model and Menu Tutorials
New Networking Model and Menu Tutorials
We've been doing a lot of work on the network code and are ready to try out a new model. Give it a try in multiplayer and be sure to let us know if it plays any smoother for you. Feedback is always appreciated. http://airme.ch/1GNQ45x
New players will now be greeted upon exiting the Challenges and given a brief tutorial for the Basecamp and some pointers to help them out in the menus. A Comms Mk1 structure will now be required to view chat, and they'll be prompted to get a blueprint from the Shop. Existing players will also need a Comms Mk1 Blueprint before they can access chat!
The Nanoforge has finally broken loose from the Info tab and is now a floating window with it's own chat channel and redesigned UI.
There are a number of minor bugfixes and UI updates in this patch, but it's main purpose is to test updates to the networking layer and work to address the disconnect issues we've been monitoring, as well as gain more information on startup issues that some players are having.
General Updates:
moved the Nanoforge out of the Info tab and into its own window
group selected units will now continue to their capture target even if it is captured before they arrive
new Basecamp and menu tutorials for new players

Happy Halloween!
Happy Halloween!
We made it just in time for Halloween, and made a special Name Your Price bundle to help you celebrate with some new flair! The Halloween Bundle includes 4500 diamonds and 10,000 kudos for whatever price you want. If you beat the current average price, you'll also receive a Ghost Gigi and Halloween Crate (Key included).
This update isn't just about Halloween. We've got many big changes you'll notice as soon as you jump into a match. For starters, your AirMech abilities will no longer be built and picked up at structures. You'll be able to upgrade them instantly with ability points earned with each level-up. We're also raising the in-game level cap from 15 to 20! This will allow you to fully upgrade most of your abilities at max level, but not all of them. Choose wisely!
What does this mean for Guardians? Since Guardians can be destroyed or lost, we've added an automatic respawn timer to rebuild them. When your AirMech is destroyed or a Guardian is shot down, it will take 30 seconds for each Guardian you've unlocked.
To top things off, we're throwing a new skin into the Fall Crate -- the Raptor Neo. Don't forget to the Shop to find the Ultimate Boxer, as well as all your favorite Halloween event items for a limited time!
General Updates:
abilities are now upgraded instantly, one ability point per level and no build time/cost
AirMechs can now reach level 20 in-game
