With Mibbit, chatting online is easy. Just choose your nickname, pick a channel and press
go! You don't need to sign up for an account and you can use it wherever you are with
just a web browser.
With Mibbit you can browse through and connect to channels or go straight to chat with people
you already know. You can embed Youtube clips, use a pastebin, share the channel URL with friends and lots more.
Signing up for an account gives you the option to control the way Mibbit works for you with a bunch of
preferences for colours, smileys, and skins.
Mibbit chat runs on all PC and Mac browsers, and if you're not at a PC it also works on PS3,
Wii and iPhone too!
