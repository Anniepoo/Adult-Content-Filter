"Chicago Rapid Transit" was written on April 12, 1999 by
George McClellen and dedicated by him to the memory of John Roache. In George's words, it's
"sorta in the style of Zez Confrey and Robin Frost."
Arranged and sequenced 8/99
by Irwin S. Schwartz. Enjoy the ride!

ANNOUNCEMENTS
Ragtime Store Opens
I have had so many requests for ragtime music recommendations that, in association with Amazon.com,
I have opened a RAGTIME STORE here in the
lobby of the Library. I have searched and researched the Amazon.com database of available material
and present my recommendations here for you to purchase.
These are all items which I have in my
own personal library and I only recommend what I know. All the items in the store are neatly
catagorically arranged in tabular form and are just a click away from the purchasing source.
I think you will appreciate and use this handy service.
Here's what one recent visitor had to say about the Ragtime Store:
"I just finished reviewing the offerings you listed as available from Amazon and I want to
thank you so very much for involving yourself with this effort! As many other long suffering
Ragtime fans have no doubt discovered, finding available recordings is a painfully slow and time
consuming task which normally meets with little success. I know I have personally spent many
hours doing web searches and searches of the data base of Amazon's biggest competitor with
disappointing results. My only problem now would seem to be financing everything I want since
I want it all! Thanks again John, I know that all your many fans and Ragtime enthusiasts really
appreciate it!" - John B., Ft. Lauderdale, Florida
