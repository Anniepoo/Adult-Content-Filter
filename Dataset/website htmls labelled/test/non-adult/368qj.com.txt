Knowing how to “read” your skin can prevent you from making mistakes that can harm your health and well being. What you need to be aware of is that what you see on the outside is a representation of what is going on inside of you, physically and emotionally.
Secrets and professional tips on how to preserve and prolong your youth, revealed in a simple and graphic way; important notions that everybody should know, which will lead to a conscious and informed decision regarding your skin.
Even if you decide to retire from work, you should never retire from life! Keep doing what you love and continue to give unconditionally. Beauty is not only a matter of how we look to others, but mostly how we make others feel in our presence.
Stay healthy, stay beautiful, stay positive in the next 365 days
and in the years to come!
