a real love and devotion for an animal. They also learn how to control something much bigger than they are, but with finesse and grace."George and Donna Harrison - 7J Ranch Diversifies with Commitment to Land StewardshipOn the Harrisons' 7J Ranch southwest of Bay City, majestic bald eagles, white-tailed deer, countless waterfowl and other wildlife thrive in tandem with a commercial cattle operation, largely due to the couple's strong commitment to land stewardship. Their tireless work enhances a roughly 6,000-acre ranch that encompasses hardwood bottoms and coastal prairies and even a restored wetland.Stubbs Ranch - Janna Stubbs, Beef Agvocate"Any amount of positive effort that a producer can give to promote their product is worthy," says Stubbs.
