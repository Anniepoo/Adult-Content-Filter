Mahjong
Instructions: Mahjong Solitaire is a tile matching puzzle game. You may click on any "free" tiles (those that are on the edge) to select them, and match them
with other free tiles with the same face to eliminate them from the board. Beat Mahjong by eliminating all tiles.
Additionally, you may also match flower tiles with other flower tiles, and season tiles with other season tiles--even if they
don't have identical faces:
flower tiles
season tiles
Mahjong is a strategy game, so it's best to think about your moves before you do them. A good plan to follow is to (whenever possible) only eliminate
tiles that free up additional tiles. This will always ensure that you have plenty of resource tiles while playing, so
you never get stuck without a move.
