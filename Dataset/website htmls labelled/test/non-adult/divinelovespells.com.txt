Success Stories
Ditch or Date Wedding!
I met Ian at a Ditch or Date event in Swindon sometime ago.
It was the first time that either of us had been speed dating.

We had our first date 9 months ago and have never looked back. We hit it off instantly and have such a great laugh together. I really think that she will be the one so we are looking to move in together in the new year - something which I never thought would happen again to me in a long time.
