﻿Welcome to the Community Bankers Association of Georgia﻿
As the state’s only advocate working solely for the interests of community banks and your customers, the Community Bankers Association of Georgia (CBA) is a member-driven organization, governed by a Board of Directors of independent community bankers. The Association was created in 1969 as a way to pool community bank resources for political representation. Today, the CBA represents approximately 200 community banks and 200 associate members. Our passion is collectively creating value for Georgia’s community banks through lobbying efforts, professional development, profit enhancement, expense savings, networking opportunities, industry updates and a full range of free member benefits.
