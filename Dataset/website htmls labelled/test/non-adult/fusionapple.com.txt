About PhotoTale
Gainesville/Ocala wedding, portrait, children and family photography by Gainesville Photographer, Lucian Badea
An unique photographic experience for you and your family
Top Shelf. Black Label. Boutique Style. These are words typically used to describe the consistent quality of the images that Lucian, the PhotoTale Studio main photographer, produces for every session, being a portrait, wedding, family or children session.
PhotoTale Studio is far from your average Gainesville portrait, wedding or family photographer. Each portrait and family session and every wedding is treated with care and creativity and customized for you and your family, contrasting with many offerings from other Gainesville  photographers who treat photography as a production line.Your session is carefully crafted to offer you an unique photography experience that best presents you and your family. For Gainesville, this is portrait, wedding, family and children photography at its best.
Creative. Stylish. Professional. Easy going.
We take pride in offering our clients the type of portrait, wedding, children and family photography they are looking for. We don’t just take pictures. We create art for our clients. We help our clients create memories.
Our Gainesville and North Florida clients are typically looking for artwork for their home and for an unique memorable photographic experience that best matches their lifestyle and family dynamics. And this Gainesville photographer is best at offering just that.   This is why our clients choose to come back and wholeheartedly recommend us to their friends and family whether they need portrait or wedding photography, family photos or children portraits.
PhotoTale Studio is serving Gainesville, Florida and the vicinity and mainly offers professional photography services (portrait photography, wedding photography, children and family photography, business headshots) in the Gainesville area, including but not limited to Newberry, Alachua, Silver Springs, Jacksonville, Saint Augustine, Tampa, Orlando. Addtional photographic services offered at this time are: high school senior photography, business headshots, lifestyle photography, maternity photography. We do no offer newborn sessions or birth and labor photography but we can recommend you other local Gainesville photographers that are excellent for this type of photography. And rest assured, we would only list recommended photographers that we would use for ourselves.
For additional information or to inquire about any other photography services not listed above, please  contact  us.
