Welcome to litecoinpool.org
Mining litecoins since October 21, 2011
New to Litecoin mining? Read our Beginner's Guide!
Welcome to the first true pay-per-share (PPS) Litecoin pool.
Some of our key features:
Exclusive ultra-low-latency Stratum server implementation, written in C
Support for Stratum over TLS, to prevent MITM attacks
Merged mining (AuxPoW) of 7 altcoins, paying out in litecoins
Support for the resume extension to Stratum
Adaptive share difficulty (“vardiff”), with support for manual tuning
Network of 8 geographically-distributed, redundant servers
Detailed stats updated every few seconds
Email notification of idle miners
Fee-free automatic and manual (instant) payouts
Two-factor authentication support
Website and mining interface also accessible as Tor hidden services
Extensive JSON API
The Reward System
Every valid share you submit to this pool is instantly credited to your account
at the current pay-per-share (PPS) rate.
This rate, expressed in litecoins,
also takes into account merged-mined coins such as Dogecoin,
resulting in higher payouts
than a regular Litecoin pool. Thanks to merged mining, you have to pay no fee;
in fact, your earnings may even be higher than with a 0-fee PPS system.
This is not a PPLNS, SMPPS or RBPPS pool:
we always pay for your work,
even if the pool has not yet solved enough blocks to cover the earnings generated.
On other systems, miners are only rewarded when and if a block matures,
but sometimes blocks get orphaned from the Litecoin network,
and therefore yield no reward.
A PPS pool, on the other hand,
takes on the risk of bad luck so you don't have to deal with variance
and orphaned blocks.
A Bit of History
LitecoinPool.org was started shortly after the birth of Litecoin by Pooler,
who is well known in the community as a member of the Litecoin core development team
and for being the maintainer of the cpuminer software package.
Since the very start, the pool used ad-hoc software:
Pooler wrote the front end entirely from scratch, with security and efficiency in mind,
while the mining back end was originally a heavily-modified version of Jeff Garzik's pushpool.
After two weeks of intensive testing, on November 5, 2011
the pool opened its doors to the public, becoming the first PPS pool for Litecoin.
In April 2012 LitecoinPool.org also became the first pool to support
variable-difficulty shares, a technique later dubbed “vardiff” by Bitcoin pools,
allowing miners to drastically reduce their network bandwidth usage.
Thanks to its advanced features and its reliability, the pool quickly attracted
a very high number of miners, to the point that during the first half of 2012
it often constituted over 40% of the entire Litecoin network.
Due to centralization concerns, it was decided to temporarily close new registrations;
later in 2012, registrations were reopened, but have since been subject
to approval.
In August 2013 the back-end software was completely redesigned and rewritten
from scratch to implement advanced efficiency and scalability optimizations
that Pooler devised after implementing support for the Stratum protocol in cpuminer.
This new implementation makes LitecoinPool.org the first Litecoin pool
based entirely on software written from scratch, and the first pool
to implement extensions to the Stratum protocol such as
“resume”, “suggest_difficulty” and “suggest_target”.
In September 2014 LitecoinPool.org also became the first Litecoin pool
to offer secure mining over TLS-encrypted Stratum connections,
protecting miners from potential man-in-the-middle attacks.
