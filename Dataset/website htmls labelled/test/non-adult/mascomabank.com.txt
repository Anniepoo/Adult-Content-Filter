Up-To-Date Contact Information is Essential
We are “watching” your ATM and debit card transactions – day and night – with an innovative fraud monitoring solution that uses state-of-the-art intelligence technology and skilled fraud experts.
If suspicious transactions are detected, a specialist will attempt to contact you via phone right away.
If fraud is confirmed, your card will be disabled immediately.
If you cannot be reached, a special “watch” status will be used on the card until we know all is well.
To assist us with this monitoring, it is very important to ensure we have your correct phone numbers on file.
Please contact an employee at any of our branch locations, or call us at 888-MASCOMA (627-2662) to verify this information.
It’s hard to put a price on peace-of-mind, but luckily you don’t have to as this service is absolutely free.

EMV Chip Technology allows for increased protection against fraud and identity theft.
Mascoma Savings Bank will begin issuing new EMV Mastercard® Debit Cards in 2016.
These cards will provide additional security of chip card technology – along with the same great benefits you enjoy now.
With a chip card, a unique code is generated with every in-person transaction which helps protect you from thieves trying to steal your data or create a counterfeit card.
All of Mascoma Savings Bank Debit Cards will be replaced in 2016 with this new technology.
