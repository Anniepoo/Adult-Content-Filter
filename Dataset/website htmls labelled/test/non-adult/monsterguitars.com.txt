Rhythmic Lead Guitar: Solo Phrasing, Groove and Timing (2010) by Barrett Tagliarino. This book/CD pack takes you step by step from beginner to master of the rhythmic aspect of soloing and riff creation.

You'll apply exact timing to bends, slides, legato articulations and grace notes to get your soloing under your complete rhythmic control. No prior music reading knowledge is required, but you will learn a bit about correct rhythmic notation as you go. Over 150 examples are tabbed and notated, and demonstrated at slow tempos on the CD.
Chapters 1-11 set up the basics: counting beats and divisions, playing in time, finding any beat, syncopation, pickup phrases, articulations, determining and contributing to the groove, finding and defining the correct phrase length.
Chapters 12-19 cover motific development; setting up audience expectations with form signaling; odd meters; creating syncopation with displacements, additive rhythms, pedal tones, polyrhythms, and metric modulation.
For reference, an appendix provides positional scales of the CAGED system, arpeggio shapes, 3-note-per-string scales, and modes.

The Guitar Reading Workbook is great for beginning guitarists or experienced by-ear players who want to get started reading notation (not to be confused with the Guitar FRETBOARD Workbook, which may be what you're after).
Early assignments in this book might take about 5 minutes to complete. Later ones can take up to half an hour. The exercises differ from chapter to chapter. Sometimes you just have to write the names of some notes or chords that you see on the staff. In others, you write which beat number a rhythm falls on. Later, you'll read some tab and translate it into regular notation, or look at some notes and identify the chord they make, and so on. When you've finished the written part, you pick up the guitar, turn on the metronome, and play the notation.
Throughout the book everything is made easy and clear as possible, so you don't ever have to learn two new things at once. But if you get this book, you should spend at least 6 months to a year with it. Go slowly! It starts out basic but takes you into some reasonably advanced territory.

Instructional DVD
Classic Rock Guitar Soloing (2000) by Barrett Tagliarino (click title to buy). On this DVD Barrett plays some examples along with a jam track so you can hear how'd you use them live, then lets the track roll on so you can try the licks by yourself.
It starts with basics like the 5 minor and major pentatonic scale patterns, dorian and aeolian modes, and the blues scale. Then you cover soloing techniques: string bending, vibrato, pull-offs, hammer-ons, and slides, along with some finger exercises to break out of the scalar rut.
There are then some classic blues and country licks that are essential to the style, with a demonstration of how to use them in major and minor keys.
Finally Barrett demonstrates phrasing principles using solo excerpts from classic songs, including "Black Magic Woman," Maggie Mae," Already Gone," "La Grange," "Money," "Stairway to Heaven," All Along the Watchtower," and Alvin Lee's "Goin' Home."
