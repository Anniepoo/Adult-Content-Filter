Below are words from some very cool people I've worked with. Note: I didn't design most of these sites. In many cases I helped out in some other way, such as creating forms and databases.
Jason’s versatile skills make him both a people-person and a techie. He is a pleasure to work with and highly skilled with all things computer. If you get the chance to hire him, take it! You will be happy you did.
Saloma Miller Furlong, Author and Speaker
Jason Woof is terrific! He hosts two sites for me and provides invaluable help on both. If there's a problem, he comes up with a simple, elegant solution. I recommend him very highly if you want a website that not only works, but that works better. Thanks, Jason! You rock!
Trevor The Games Man, Entertainer
Jason built me a creative, professional website that clearly communicates my practice. He was a pleasure to work with, making the task simple and straight-forward. I highly recommend him!
Dr Jen Green, Naturopathic Doctor
Jason Woofenden has hosted my webpage for almost ten years. He is patient with my inexperience and promptly responsive to all my inquiries. My page is clear, attractive, well organized, and has directed many people to my work.
