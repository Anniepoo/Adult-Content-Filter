How to Browse and Purchase Board Games on this Website:
Scroll Window Below for Information:
Board Game World accepts secure credit card payments through PayPal.
We also accept checks (drawn on a US bank)
or money orders payable in US dollars.
For our international customers (non US) only we accept bank transfers (or Giros).
There are basically three ways to use this website in order to purchase board games:
1) Use the automated ordering system and pay online with a credit card.
Click here if you want to see how to use the automated
ordering system.
2) Place the order by e-mail and then pay for the order.
The payment can still be made by credit card after the total is calculated
with shipping charges.  Click here to see how easy it is to e-mail your order!  For European Community (EC), US, Canadian, and Austrailian shipping addresses and most current web browsers even e-mailing your order is automated!
3) Place the order by telephone and then pay for the order.
The payment can be made by credit card after you place the order by telephone - BUT IT MUST BE MADE ONLINE if
it is made by credit card.
There are several reasons for placing your order by e-mail or telephone.
Here are the main reasons:
1) Automated Online ordering is currently available to shipping addresses in the US, Australia, Canada and the European Community.
Orders for shipping addresses from most other countries require an initial e-mail or telephone call in order to make the arrangements.
Once your e-mail is received we can calculate the
shipping cost for your order and give you the correct total.
Once you approve the total for your order we will provide instructions for buying
with credit card or bank Giro.
2) Another reason one might need to place his or her order by e-mail or telephone is that some items in the inventory may be low in available quantity.
In that case the system will advise you that an e-mail must be sent before your order is processed.
3) You may prefer to pay by some means other than a credit card.
In that case your purchase must be completed by either e-mail or a telephone call.
4) Finally, this web site may not be compatible with your web browser and if so it may be difficult to use the automated ordering system.
There is one really good reason to use the automated ordering system: It is quick and easy if you see exactly what you want on the website and you are paying by credit card
and your shipping address is in the US, Australia, Canada, or the European Community.)

To use the automated ordering system:
Scroll Window Below for Information:
1. Use the tabbed Menu Window to choose the category of board game you are looking for and see the listing of games
in that category.  There are tabs across the top of the window that let you search by the language, country, or game title.  If you are not sure which category will list the game(s) you will wish to look at (and hopefully buy) then the first menu tab, "THE PLACE", will offer numerous possibilities.
&nbsp Clicking on the first link at the top of the list on "THE PLACE" LIST, titled "The Place to Buy Board Games From All Around the World" will show you everything.   It will show you the entire list of games that you can browse through the automated system.
2. When you find a game you wish to learn more about you can click on the "thumbnail" picture.
Clicking the thumbnail will open a separate window with
either a larger picture or possibly a written description of the game.
To return to the Board Game Listing where you clicked the thumbnail just
close the window that opened when you clicked the thumbnail picture.
3.
If you wish to purchase a game from those you see listed, just enter the number of games of that particular edition you wish to buy in the "Order
Quantity" field on the row for that particular game.
4.
Choose as many items as you wish to purchase in a given category.
It is fairly easy to return to the tabbed Menu Window for a different search, once you've clicked on a specific link to a list of games, by clicking the "Board Game Menu" or "Home" link near the top of the web page.
Please note:  Clicking on the "Update" button to the right of any item quantity or at the bottom of a list of games will add all of the items you have selected from the same menu page to your shopping basket all at once.
This means that if you are buying multiple items in the same category you only need to update
your shopping basket once to add all of the items that you select.  Please remember to add items to your shopping basket by clicking one of the "UPDATE" buttons before you search for additional games to buy.  Each time you add items to your shopping basket, the shopping basket page will appear and you can either review your order and check out or continue to shop!
It should also be noted that if you leave your web browser idle for a prolonged period your session will "timeout" and you will need to return to the home page (www.boardgameworld.com) and start over from there.
5. On the order review page, once you select "Check Out Now" and provide your customer ID and password (or create a customer ID and password) then you will be able to select your payment type.
Once you select a valid shipping method and "Secure Online Payment by Credit Card or E-Check&quot you will be directed to the final check out screen which will transfer you to the PayPal secure
payments website.
There you can finish paying for your order.
6. You will receive an e-mail within 12 hours, usually much sooner, confirming that we have received your payment.
7. Your order will typically ship within 24 hours.
In most cases it is guaranteed to ship within 72 hours.
