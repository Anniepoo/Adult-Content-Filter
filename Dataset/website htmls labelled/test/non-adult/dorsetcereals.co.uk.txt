FAQs
Introduction
What is a Token?
Tokens are a virtual currency that you can collect by playing our online games like Spring to Win and Mini Games, entering our prize draws and competitions and taking part in our B&B Awards
You will also have been awarded tokens if you entered our Win a Woodland on-pack offer
You can then exchange your Tokens for a range of offers that will change over time
To see what Tokens look like and for a summary of the current offers, click here
How do I take part in Tokens?
Taking part in Tokens is a simple three-step process:
Register for a Tokens account – you just have to log-in if you already have one. If you don’t, you can create an account for free
Collect Tokens online
Swap your Tokens for your chosen offer from those currently available
How many different offers are there to choose from?
At the moment, you can swap your Tokens for a £1 voucher for one of our Ultimate Mueslis or Ultimate Granolas
The voucher is delivered digitally, via your printer, and you may need to install a printer driver – full instructions will be provided
The voucher is valid in any store that sells Dorset Cereals Ultimate Mueslis or Ultimate Granolas
More offers will be added over time
How many times can I take part?
You can exchange your Tokens for one voucher for Ultimate Mueslis and one voucher for Ultimate Granolas each month
There is no limit to the number of months in which you can claim a voucher
When does Tokens start and finish?
You can start collecting Tokens from 1st September 2015
Tokens is a rolling scheme, like many others of this type, and there is no set closing date
Before Tokens closes, we will give you at least three months notice by email and online and explain how and when to spend your Tokens
My Account
How do I take part in Tokens?
If you already have a Tokens account, you can sign in here
If you do not, click here to register for free
I have set up an account – why haven’t I received my activation email yet?
Make sure you check your junk or spam folder, as sometimes emails get sent there instead of to your inbox
I am trying to set up an account but have received an error message – what should I do?
When entering your personal information (name, email address etc) please ensure you have completed all the required fields and that all the information you have entered is correct
What if I have forgotten my password?
Not a problem – just log in as usual with your email address, click on the link next to "forgot your password?" and we will email you a link that lets you reset your password
Can I change my account details?
Of course – make sure you’re signed in and go to my account
This will let you change your email and/or delivery address and even your name, as well as decide whether you want to subscribe to our email offers
What happens to my Tokens after I have used them for an offer?
Tokens will be deducted from your account instantly for each offer you redeem
You can easily check your balance and recent activity by logging in to your account
How can I find out my Tokens balance?
Again, make sure you’re signed in and go to my account
You will see a mini-statement showing how you have earned your Tokens and, just as importantly, how you have spent them
If you have any questions about the number of Tokens in your account, just email pleasetellus@dorsetcereals.co.uk
Offers
How many different offers are there to choose from?
You can spend your Tokens on the following offers:
Voucher for £1 off Ultimate Mueslis
Voucher for £1 off Ultimate Granolas
How do I claim my voucher?
Once you’ve banked enough Tokens, you can swap them for the offer of your choice
Just click through to the page offering you a choice of £1 off Ultimate Mueslis or £1 off Ultimate Granolas
A message will pop-up on your screen and you will be asked to confirm that you accept the terms and conditions and understand the voucher print instructions
If you have not already installed the printer driver, instructions will appear explaining how to do this
Once your printer driver is installed, a message will appear on screen while the voucher is printing, then another once it has successfully printed
If for any reason the voucher does not print successfully, an error message will appear.
After I have claimed my voucher, how long will it take to print?
As long as your printer is set to default, switched on and contains paper and ink, the voucher should print within moments
What happens if I the voucher does not print?
This may be for one of the following reasons:
The printer driver is not installed correctly
The voucher is not being sent to the default printer
The printer is out of paper or ink
The error message will direct you to an online help screen which should help you solve the problem and print the voucher
If you are still experiencing difficulties printing, please email pleasetellus@dorsetcereals.co.uk and we will send you a coupon in the post
What if I don’t have a printer to print my voucher?
Maybe you could ask a member of your family or a friend if you could use theirs, or print it off at work if they’ll let you. Failing that, you could use a local library or print shop
By when do I have to redeem my voucher?
Each voucher can be redeemed any time up to a month from when you print it, after which it is no longer valid
Why do I have to collect so many Tokens for the voucher?
We think 20 tokens is about right as a reward to you for playing our games and hopefully having fun on our website
Offers start at 20 Tokens, which is the equivalent of two entries to Win a Woodland or playing one our games each day for just three weeks
What’s more, we no longer reset Tokens each month, so if you play the games less frequently, you can collect over time
Spring to Win
I have registered to play – why haven’t I received my activation email yet?
Make sure you check your junk or spam folder, as sometimes emails get sent there instead of to your inbox
Why am I not being allowed my full three jumps?
You may have clicked “jump” twice without realising – take care to make just one jump at a time
Why is the game skipping during play?
Why can’t I see properly when I log-in to play?
Either of the above may happen if you have a slow internet connection, which causes Spring to Win to slow down, jump or stop
I receive regular emails from you, so why can’t I play?
You may be signed-up to receive our monthly newsletters and enter our prize draw, or to have opened a Tokens account, without registering to play Spring to Win

Technical Queries
How do I print my coupon?
Click ‘CONFIRM’ and a message will appear telling you your printer software is running – make sure the printer is turned on.
When the printer software has downloaded, a message will appear – the software will have been sent to your ‘downloads’ folder unless you have your computer set up to send it to another location.
Double-click on the printer software package and follow the instructions.
When the installation has completed, a message will appear and your coupon will print automatically.
If your coupon cannot print for one of the following reasons, please click ‘Help’ for further instructions:
The software has not been installed correctly.
Your printer is not set up or is not switched on.
You have already printed the coupon.
If the online instructions don’t solve the problem, please contact the coupon helpdesk:
wecare@valassis.co.uk.
What if the Tokens website isn’t working?
It may be a problem with our site or it may be a problem at your end
We suggest that you close down your internet connection, wait a few minutes, then try again – if there’s still a problem, email us at pleasetellus@dorsetcereals.co.uk
What if the website stops working while I am making a claim and the Tokens are removed from my account, but the voucher does not print?
We will look into it for you – if your Tokens have been removed, your claim will almost certainly have been processed so we ensure that you receive your voucher
Why don’t you support my browser?
We support the following browsers which cover over 98% of all internet traffic – if yours is not in this list and you want to take part in Tokens, we suggest you upgrade your browser:
Google Chrome (latest version)
Firefox (latest version)
Safari (latest version)
Internet Explorer (version 8 and above)
How will my data be used?
We will only contact you again if you have ticked the box to opt-in to hear from us again
We never sell data to or share data with other brands or third parties
General Questions
Why can’t I keep the Tokens that I collected up to August 2015?
The new Tokens collector programme is a different scheme from the one we used to run
Because Tokens is now different, we have reset Tokens so that everyone has the same opportunity to claim our offers
To help those of you who had collected Tokens before September 2015, we have allowed you to keep up to 20 Tokens from Win a Woodland entries and 10 from playing our games
This has been backdated, so tokens collected at any time count, even though we used to reset tokens every month
We are no longer resetting tokens, so you can keep on collecting
Can I take part in Tokens if I don’t live in mainland Britain?
Of course, as long as you are aged 18 years old or over
Tokens is open to all UK residents, including Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands
However, you are not able to participate if you live in the Republic of Ireland
Why do I have to be 18 to take part?
This is a legal requirement and ensures that we are not in breach of any rules regarding marketing to children
Can I take part in Tokens if I don’t have internet access?
Unfortunately not – as most people have internet access, you can only take part by going online
If you don’t have internet access, you could visit a local library or internet café, or use a friend’s computer
Where else can I find out about Tokens?
We will mostly be using our products and our website to promote Tokens, but there will also be some magazine and online advertising, so keep a lookout and you may be able to take advantage of a special offer
Can I change my mind once I have claimed a voucher?
No, sorry, once you have clicked “Claim” the Tokens have been deducted from your account and the voucher print process is underway
What if I do not want to claim any of your offers?
We are sorry there is nothing you like, but we will be refreshing our offers so please keep looking
Why are Tokens not on your packs?
We have started with Tokens from our online games and offers but do have plans to feature them on our packs in future
Who should I contact with questions about your Ultimate Mueslis, Ultimate Granolas and products?
Our customer service team are happy to help you with any product enquiries – just email them at pleasetellus@dorsetcereals.co.uk
There are lots more questions and answers on our website – all you have to do is visit dorsetcereals.co.uk/about-us/faq/
Why is there no phone number that I can call for help?
We find that nearly everyone who contacts us finds it easier to email their queries, which also makes it easier for us to find the problem and hopefully fix it
Our customer service team are busy answering all your questions about our delicious products, so we have created this list of questions you’re likely to ask about our Tokens offer, to save you having to call them
If you still need to know something that isn’t covered here, please email pleasetellus@dorsetcereals.co.uk
What if I have a question that is not covered here?
Please email us at pleasetellus@dorsetcereals.co.uk
We will be updating these questions regularly, so if we think that your question – and our answer – will benefit others, we will add it to the list
How long will you take to get back to me?
We will try to respond to all your questions within 48 hours (two working days), but bear with us if on occasion it takes longer than that
