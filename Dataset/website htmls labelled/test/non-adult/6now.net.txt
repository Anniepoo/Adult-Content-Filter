From our 1996 Objectives
The fundamental human desire for communication has been the engine
driving social, cultural, scientific, and economic development throughout
history. The new medium of the Internet has brought about widespread,
creative communication between individuals and groups that previously had
little chance of contact.
The overriding objective of the Society is to give expression to the
needs and wishes of individuals, groups, or organisations that have a
common interest in the viability of the Internet in Australia, so that
all Australian users of the Internet may continue to benefit from, and
contribute to its applications, technologies, and evolution.
Thank you to all ISOC-AU members for your ongoing years of
commitment.

Data Retention Bill: A threat to civil rights protections that just won't
work!
22 January 2015: The Internet Society of Australia has called on the
Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security (PJCIS) to recommend
a total rethink of the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment

his board and members are extremely concerned that the legislation, as
currently drafted, simply won't achieve the Government's stated aims while
constituting a serious threat to existing civil rights protections.

Ten Questions about Metadata
Retention
The Australian Government has announced it will mandate the retention of
communications metadata for two years.
ISOC-AU believes the proposal requires
a rigorous business case and/or regulatory impact assessment process which
takes into account the costs and risks across industry and the economy as a
whole.
Based on the technical and policy experience of its members,
ISOC-AU poses ten questions in relation to the proposal ...
