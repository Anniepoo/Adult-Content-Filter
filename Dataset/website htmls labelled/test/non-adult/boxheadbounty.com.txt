BOXHEAD : 2 PLAYER
Boxhead 2 Player allows you and a friend to team up and fight the never-ending battle against the hordes of zombies in this multiplayer game of the Boxhead series. What makes Boxhead 2 Player different from the original Boxhead game? Boxhead 2 Player allows for multiplayer action. Teaming up with a friend not only doubles your fire power, it opens up a whole new style of game that is Boxhead. Also, you can change the difficulty in the options tab before starting a game. Doing so will increase zombie speed and the rate at which they appear. This can be benificial however, because the faster they come, the faster you can kill them and get upgrades! Also in the options tab you can adjust whether or not devils appear and toggle 2 player friendly fire. Doing either of these will forfeit a high score, but you can still have all the fun you want! Boxhead 2 Player is one of my personal favorites, I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!
