Welcome to 40-2-60 South East London & Kent's friendliest social club!
Our Social Club is open for membership to people between 40 and 60 living in the following postal regions:
DA, SE and BR  Most of our members live in Abbey Wood, Beckenham, Belvedere, Bexley, Bexleyheath, Bickley, Brockley, Bromley, Catford, Charlton, Chislehurst, Crayford, Dartford, Eltham, Erith, Gravesend, Greenhithe, Lee, Mottingham, New Eltham, Orpington, Petts Wood, Plumstead, Sidcup, Swanley, Thamesmead, Welling, West Wickham and Wilmington. For ME, CRO and TN postcodes membership is at the discretion of the management. Please note ID will be asked for prior to joining either driving licence or passport.
Some of the most common things said to us by potential members are:
"I thought I was the only one who felt this way" or "I can't tell anyone I am doing this because of the stigma of joining a dating agency"
We are not a dating agency, but a social club for single people over 40. Most members are not looking for a relationship just new friends and a social life.
After joining us they say:
"You were right, there is light at the end of the tunnel"
"I have gone from being sad, bored and lonely, to having such a full social life with so many friends"
"It has changed my life, there is no stigma, I have told everyone about this great social club"
