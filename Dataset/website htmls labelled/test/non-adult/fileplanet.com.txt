Cloning Chicken
Posted on March 13th, 2012
If you're craving a whacky demo that takes the idea of cloning and takes it to hilarious extremes, try out the Cloning Clyde Demo. Our tower defense fans can now finally get a taste of Defense Grid: Gold with its latest trial client. We know many have tried it, but it's still one of the best tower defense games to date. - Ferret
