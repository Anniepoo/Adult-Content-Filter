Fantastic Contraption
The Game
Fantastic Contraption was originally a building game made way back in 2008. Millions of people played it obsessively and saved over 12 million contraptions. You can still play it for free. For years we loved the idea of a three dimensional Fantastic Contraption but just couldn't figure out how it would work. Then we tried the Vive.
The new Fantastic Contraption has been designed from the ground up to be a room-scale VR game. Imagine walking around a grassy island floating in the sky making a contraption the size of a horse with your hands then watching it roll out into the world. It's a VR experience you and your friends will play for hours.
