Personal Development for Smart People
The purpose of this website is to help you grow as a conscious human being. This includes guiding you to discover and accept your life purpose; inspiring you to feel more motivated, energized, and passionate; helping you shed disempowering relationships and build a network of loving support; teaching you how to achieve stable financial abundance doing what you love; and encouraging you to make a genuine contribution to humanity -- so you can finally experience the kind of life that deep down, you always knew you were meant to live.
You aren't here to struggle and suffer. You're here to express and share your creative gifts, to give and receive love, and to be happy. It will take time, but this site can certainly help you get there, and the vast majority of resources here are free.
This site will help you make conscious decisions in your personal development journey and courageously follow through. This means having the maturity to take 100% responsibility for your health, your career, your finances, your relationships, your emotions, your habits, and your spiritual beliefs. It requires taking a deep look at yourself, consciously deciding what kind of person you truly are on the inside, and then getting your external reality to be congruent with your inner being. The goal is to help you achieve outstanding effectiveness while maintaining internal balance, where your thoughts, feelings, actions, and skills are all working together to create the life you truly desire.
Personal development is hard work. It takes time, consistency, and patience. If you're only here looking for shallow quick fixes and you aren't interested in real, lasting change, this isn't the right place for you. This site is designed for people who are serious about personal growth and willing to commit to it.
This site will help you learn to live more consciously, to summon the courage to face the unfaceable parts of your life, and to solve the deep problems you've not yet been able to solve. You'll learn practical ideas to make important changes in your life, both big and small, so you can get your life on track and start living up to your potential.
This site can't teach you to be perfect. Perfection isn't the point. The point is for you to get yourself onto a path of practical, positive growth. It's very likely that this site will be of tremendous assistance to you on your journey.
The main themes of this site are:
Truth: Accept reality and rid your life of falsehood and denial
Love: Improve your ability to connect with yourself and others
Power: Build your motivation and discipline to create the life you desire
Oneness: Stop fighting against resistance, and make the world your ally
Authority: Take command of your life, and learn to make clear decisions
Courage: Summon the inner strength to take action in spite of fear
Intelligence: Live authentically, and express your genuine creativity
The areas of your life this site will help you improve include:
Habits: Create a daily routine that gives you a sense of flow
Career: Build a career you're truly passionate about
Money: Achieve financial abundance without compromising your integrity
Health: Adopt health habits that empower your physical body
Relationships: Enjoy loving relationships that help you grow
Spirituality: Raise your awareness and live more consciously
