Vaughan Williams On Wenlock Edge andWarlock The Curlew Ian Partridge, The Music Group of London. Re-released together on a new 2-disc set from EMI Classics.
If there's a lovelier recording of...On Wenlock Edge than the version recorded in 1970...I certainly haven't heard it. This magical account has returned to the catalogue...Partridge's voice is at its freshest and his delivery of words is so intelligent: always clear and expressive. In 1973, Partridge and the Music Group of London teamed up to make another memorable recording - The Curlew...Strongly recommended. International Record Review, January 2010.More details
