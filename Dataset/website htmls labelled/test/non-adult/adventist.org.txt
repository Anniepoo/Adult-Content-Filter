The Clifford Goldstein Story
To view this video please enable JavaScript and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video.
Clifford Goldstein didn’t believe in much, but one thing he did believe in was Truth. He just didn't know what it was or where to find it. As the fiery writer traveled Europe and Israel in search of his novel's soul, his quest for meaning of life continued, leading him to a different kind of altar.
Little did he know that one dark night in the summer of 1979, his search would end with a decision that would change his life forever.
Our beliefs
