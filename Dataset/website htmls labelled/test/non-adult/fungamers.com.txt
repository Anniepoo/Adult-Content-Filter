BCAMT Book Club
Posted on 17 December 2015 by Colin | Comments Off on BCAMT Book Club
Just in time for our winter break, the BCAMT book club web page is operational.
http://www.bcamt.ca/bookclub/
The featured books will change over time, but we will keep a history of all reviewed books with reader comments and ratings. If you have read any of the feature books already, please take some time to write your own comment and give a rating. The comments section can also be a place to start a discussion – this is how it will start to feel more like a book club.

Apply for BCAMT Grants!
Posted on 25 November 2015 by Colin | Comments Off on Apply for BCAMT Grants!
Each year the BCAMT budgets $5000 to give away in grants, generally to groups who want to work collaboratively on projects related to math education in BC.
Last year we supported the Math Challengers program (https://apeg.bc.ca/Math-Challengers/Math-Challengers-Home) and a cross-district Reggio-inspired project (https://twitter.com/hashtag/BCAMTreggio).
Although the deadline has passed this year, there is still a significant amount of money available, so we have extended the dealine to January 8.
Note that successful applicants must write an article detailing their work for “Vector”.
For more information, and an application form, please visit www.bcamt.ca/grants.

Basic Number Facts
Posted on 26 June 2015 by Colin | Comments Off on Basic Number Facts
Children learn mathematics to help them make better sense of the world around them, and to develop skills necessary in their lives.
Part of this is achieving computational fluency with basic multiplication and addition facts. The BCAMT has produced a pamphlet (and accompanying web page) for parents, teachers, and students that attempts to answer some frequently asked questions about how to learn basic number facts.
You can access it and download the pamphlet at www.bcamt.ca/facts.
