Thank you to Elizabeth Morin for the beautiful photo, Winter Sledding, a 2014 Annual Community Photo Contest winner. Each year, amateur and professional photographers are invited to submit photographs that capture the character and beauty of central New Hampshire. The winning photos are displayed on the MVSB website and/or in the annual Community Calendar. Visit any of our local offices to pick up a copy of the latest Community Calendar; but don't delay as quantities are limited.
