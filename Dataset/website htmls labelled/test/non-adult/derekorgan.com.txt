What's on your mind?

Manager Product Management @Workday
"Simplicity is hard work. But, there's a huge payoff. The person who has a genuinely simpler system - a system made out of genuinely simple parts, is going to be able to affect the greatest change with the least work. He's going to kick your ass. He's gonna spend more time simplifying things up front and in the long haul he's gonna wipe the plate with you because he'll have that ability to change things when you're struggling to push elephants around."
Rich Hickey, Creator of the Clojure programming language

Co-Founder / SeenBefore
Find that website you read weeks ago, faster than any other tool.
Works across multiple machines, displays results within Google's results and stores the website so if the content online ever changes, you can still read it.
40% of searches online are people simply looking for what they have already seen before. Time to improve this experience!
The service is built on Ruby on Rails, MongoDB and Solr.
We also have some fairly complex Browser plugins written in a mixture of Coffee Script and raw Javascript.
We were fortunate enough be called for interview in Y-Combinator but didn't take it past that stage.
