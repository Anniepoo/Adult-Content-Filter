Aardwolf RPG is a unique and free text based roleplaying game. Aardwolf is based in the fantasy world of Andolor where magic is common and there are hundreds of exotic realms to explore, puzzles to solve and quests to
complete. Aardwolf features a realistic game world with multiple continents and real geography. Each area includes a real time line-of-sight overhead map to see other characters and points of interest around you.
Create your character from any one of 28 classes including fighter classes such as Soldiers, Knights, Hunters, Barbarians, Rangers, Archers, Assassins and Paladins or select a magic based class including Elementalists, Necromancers, Healers, Priests, Witches and Enchanters. Once you have choosen your race, your guild and your profession then the rest is up to you. You have absolute control over your character's actions and there are many ways to play Aardwolf.

You can play the game solo or group with other players, focus on gaining experience and levels, take part in hundreds of quests, solve puzzles, explore, map, play casino games for in-game currency, join a clan, take part in our forums, enchant and craft equipment, compete with other players in
player-vs-player combat and global quests, answer trivia, create your own
private manor, experiment with hundreds of spells and skills and even, eventually, build your own additions to the world.
If you have never played a text based RPG before, we offer an extensive in-game help system to help you get started and a team of volunteer
"helpers" who answer questions in real time. We also have a very detailed
starting area called "The Aylorian Academy" - your first major quest in the
game where you are guided through playing Aardwolf in an interactive format.
