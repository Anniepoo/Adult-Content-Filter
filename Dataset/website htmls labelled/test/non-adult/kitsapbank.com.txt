"What a great place to do business. The Sequim Branch is extremely active in the community. Some of the staff volunteer in the community and the Branch has worked to be able to contribute $1000 for the City Music in the Park for summer outdoor enjoyment and also contributed $1000 to the dedication of our new City Hall. Who could ask for more!!! I greatly enjoy working with all of the staff and certainly Lori sets the tone for a wonderful banking experience. My gratitude to all of them."
