Rating Songs. Have so many songs that you've never gotten a chance to rate them?
MP3-Boss makes this EASY!
Individually rate the song that's playing, change the song category, even rename the file!
Plus, an audio-preview function means that you can listen to song snapshots to QUICKLY rate your songs!
Extensive database functions - sorting, searching, filtering, reporting. Want to play just a specific artist, album or title?
Just filter the database and INSTANTLY play the songs you want.
No other manager makes on-the-fly playlist so fast and convenient.
General file management - rename, copy, move, delete (even while playing music).
No longer will you need to worry about WHERE you store your audio files -- MP3-Boss keeps track -- and changing the name or folder in MP3-Boss automatically updates the actual filename and folder!
Wait until you see how FAST you can move hundreds of files to a new drive -- MP3-Boss caches the changes you want to make and takes care of all that tedious work in the background -- while you continue to play your music!
Safe! Plan to move a lot of files around?
Most programs will blindly move your files from drive to drive without worrying about file corruption.
MP3-Boss verifies that the file transfer was successful before the original is deleted -- you'd be surprised how easy it is to get corrupted files without this extra safety check!
File cleanup - find exact or partial duplicates, and delete the songs you don't want - move the duplicates to the recycle bin, a new folder, or even to CD!
Artist cleanup - an amazing new way to look at your songlist by Artist -- and correct hundreds of artistnames with just a few clicks!
CD functions - create CD label inserts, automatically delete duplicates from your hard drive that are already on a CD, find filenames that will cause problems when burned to CD.
PLUS, a smart-search that will treat all of your CD drives as equivalent.
Rename or move your files.
Want to move all your Death Metal to a new folder with subfolders based on the Artist & Album?
MP3-Boss makes it EASY!
Plus, because it intelligently moves files in the background, you can keep playing your songs while it does the heavy lifting in the background!
Album Art
New release (Nov2008) now shows all the graphics files that are in your music file directories.
A great way to get additional information about your songs -- plus MP3-Boss gives you immediate access to those files -- for printing, cleanup or to use with other graphics programs.
Copy Shortcut
New release (Nov2008) lets you click on the selected song and drag ... so you can paste in other applications.
Or, right-click on the selected song and use Windows Explorer functions to bring up the song in any of your other associated applications.
PAR, PAR2, SFV Cleanup
New utility function (Nov2008) lets you cleanup and confirm your Usenet downloads.
Just specify the download directory and a cleaned directory -- and MP3-Boss will verify that the song sets are complete (using MD5 or CRC32 checksum verification) and then move the complete sets to a new directory based on the tagged Artist/Album information.
While other utilities can cleanup Usenet downloads, MP3-Boss actually reads the embedded information and can really organized the files.
This is a first for Usenet cleanup!

Want to sort your songs by BPM (beats-per-minute)?
How about automatically and quickly calculating beats-per-minute for all your songs using AutoBPM?
Advanced calculations make sure that only the CORRECT BPM is entered for your songs.
A quick-BPM mode moves through your songs as quickly as possible...moving to the next song once the BPM calculation is stable.
Create reports based on all or some of your songs, songs on a specific CD, or just the songs in the current playlist.
