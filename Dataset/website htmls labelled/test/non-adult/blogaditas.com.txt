We Are PAD
Portland Alternative Dwellings (PAD) is a tiny house education, resource and consulting company based in Portland, Oregon. We are dedicated to making tiny house living a reality for those who have a dream to build tiny.
Dee Williams has lived in her little house since 2004.  She founded PAD to help others find a way to make their housing serve their life, instead of the other way around.  Her memoir, The Big Tiny, is now available.  Dee has been featured in The New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Yahoo.com, National Public Radio, CBS This Morning, and more.  Learn more about Dee Williams.

Dee Williams’ TEDx Talk
“What purchase, what new item, would you want to hold in your arms as you die? What favorite room in your house could accommodate that last breath? Can you imagine how our consumer patterns would change, and how small our houses would shrink, if we asked those questions a little more often?”
