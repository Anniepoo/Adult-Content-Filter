Prince Noctis is Back!
11 Jun 2013 by Nightmare
The game you've been waiting for i.e. Final Fantasy Versus XIII has finally returned, but with some major changes. Instead of Final Fantasy Versus XIII, it is now called Final Fantasy XV which means that it is the next installment in the series. Also, it is no longer being developed for the PS3. The game will be available for both Playstation 4 and Xbox One which explains why Square Enix kept it under wraps before Sony and Microsoft announced their new consoles.The trailer shown at E3 focuses on Final Fantasy XV's story and gameplay. From the dialogue it becomes evident the game is about a war in which the nation's crystal must be protected at all costs. Regarding gameplay, it can be seen that the User Interface is different from that of previous trailers. It is now more action oriented like that of Type-0.In case the previous video wasn't enough, here's another one for you to enjoy...
