The Colorado capitol had a back to school vibe Wednesday, with families and friends joining lawmakers in the chamber for the opening of Colorado's annual legislative session. The building hummed with activity — and the usual pomp and ceremony and opening day speeches — after the eight month interim. Isaac Slade, the lead singer of the Denver-based rock band The Fray, sang the national anthem in the Senate. But it wasn't all fun, the first bills are introduced on opening day, and lawmakers begin to outline their priorities for the next four months.

Saw Peter is Karen. That’s an ethnic group in Myanmar, formerly known as Burma. And for more than 100 Karen refugees in rural Delta, Colo., he’s the go-to person for advice, translation and other essential information. Like the other refugees in this community, life hasn’t been easy for Peter. As a young man, he smuggled his family to Malaysia because the government in Myanmar seized their farm and threatened to kill them.
