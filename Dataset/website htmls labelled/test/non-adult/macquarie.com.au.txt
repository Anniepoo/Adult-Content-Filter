1 Qantas Points, offered by Macquarie, accrue and will be credited to your Qantas Frequent Flyer account in accordance with the 'Macquarie Bank Flyer Home Loan Terms and Conditions'. You must be a member of the Qantas Frequent Flyer program to earn and redeem Qantas Points and to qualify for a Macquarie Bank Flyer Home Loan. A joining fee usually applies. However, Macquarie has arranged for this to be waived if you take out a Macquarie Bank Flyer Home Loan. Membership and the earning and redemption of Qantas Points are subject to the Qantas Frequent Flyer terms and conditions available at qantas.com/terms. You will not receive any Qantas Points while you have defaulted on a loan repayment on your loan account and this amount remains outstanding for 60 days or more. Macquarie is not responsible for the administration of the Qantas Frequent Flyer program. Qantas Airways Limited remains at all times solely responsible for the administration of the Qantas Frequent Flyer program.
Qantas has made no enquiries as to the accuracy of the Macquarie products or services described, and is not responsible for errors or omissions. Macquarie Bank Flyer Home Loans are not Qantas products and are not offered or issued by Qantas but by Macquarie as Servicer.
