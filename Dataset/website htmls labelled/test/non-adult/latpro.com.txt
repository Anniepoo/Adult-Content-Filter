Weve always believed that the most satisfying careers for Hispanic and bilingual professionals are the ones that use our language skills or multicultural experience. But dont take our word for itlisten to their voices as they tell their own stories. Take this opportunity to learn from their ups and downs and share your own!
My native language is Portuguese (the Brazilian flavor) and
it has helped me a lot since it was either a requirement or a
desirable skill in my last 3 jobs...
Multilingual
Webmaster
Being fluent in English and Spanish has helped me immensely
at work, giving me the opportunity to participate in media
interviews in both languages. It has also helped me establish
a closer bond with our clients...
Senior
Event Planner
Speaking more than one language has been an enormous help to
me professionally. Without English I may have had to flip
burgers when I arrived in the US...
The key is to live a lifestyle that is within your means and
finding satisfaction in what you can afford...
Bilingual
Sales Rep
Sometimes is better to say no to some money, but have a
well balanced life...
Software
Development Manager
This industry is an Old Boys Club. Coming in as a young,
female, Latina professional, Ive been overlooked often as
too young or inexperienced when meeting new people in the
business...
Bilingual
Insurance Agent
I knew at that moment that what I did for families was a good
thing and I knew at that moment that I didnt want to do
anything else...
Financial
Divisiobn Leader
I learned by working in the ghetto that there is a tremendous
misunderstanding of the industry. I noticed that the scripts
we use have no fit with the low income families I serve...
Supervising
Insurance Agent
Im Mexican-American and early on in my career it was a
little more difficult because they didnt classify us as
Hispanic... at that time there was a bit more of a stigma being
a professional Mexican. Even today there is still a stigma
out there but it has gotten better...
Once you get in the workplace, no matter what your surname
is, when you perform well, the creme will rise to the top...
Telecommunications
m Mexican, first generation in the US. Ive had a wider
range of cases at the Shelter due to the diversity in San
Diego and the strong Hispanic population, so it has helped me
a lot. Speaking Spanish in Southern California is a must at
times. It has helped me tremendously and Im glad my parents
enforced that I remained fluent in Spanish...
Social
Worker
I deal with Hispanic media and am good at what I do because I
not only buy, plan and place the media... I also consume and
understand the programming choices.
Hispanic
Media Buyer
When I am teaching a particularly complex lesson, and I get
an Aha! moment from my students, that is an amazing
feeling. At that moment, your world feels complete...
High
School Dept Chair
Fresh out of college, I was working late and one of the
managing partners came over and asked me to empty out the
trash cans from the offices before I left for the evening. I
was shocked, but then I laughed at her. I just reminded her
that I was part of her team. I dont let these kinds of
things get to me.
Once I had an agency share proposals for a TV spot and they
presented an ad containing paper mâché piñatas, ceramic
figurines, and all the stereotypical souvenirs a tourist in
Mexico would be interested in. This was only 5 years ago with
a major ad agency, and even though we had a VERY long meeting
with them about it, they never really understood what the
problem was.
Multicultural
Marketing Expert
When I was starting out and I was put on the spot by
management and was asked to explain something I did and why,
I would be told not to be defensive. After many years of
hearing it and not quite understanding it, I realized I
wasnt always in front of a firing squad for my actions, and
that I wasnt always being blamed for something going wrong.
Sometimes management just needed to understand what decisions
were being made, and the reason behind them, so they would
know how to move forward, or how to best change direction.
Efficiency
Expert
People who come to the US from other countries seeking the
dream tend to work very hard to achieve their goals and that
is why most of us succeed.
International Travel
Agent

"We have filled the position. Thanks to your service, we found Carlos, who is bilingual, and is performing the job perfectly. Many Thanks. "C.H. President10/27/2005
