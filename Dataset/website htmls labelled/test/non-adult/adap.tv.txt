AOL Shifts Toward More Live Daily Programming on Web
This year, AOL is all about live. Indeed, as the Web pioneer heads toward it fourth NewFront presentation on Tuesday, the company appears to have made a strategic programming shift.

Web Series Wednesday: Since NewFronts 2014...
Since NewFronts is coming up next week, we figured we’d revisit some of the best series that were announced at the event last year. Now showing on The New York Times, AOL, Hulu, Yahoo, and Vice News, these series mean that this year’s NewFronts have a lot to live up to. If publishers manage it, we’ll have some great web series to look forward to this later this year.
