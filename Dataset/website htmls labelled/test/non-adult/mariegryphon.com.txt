People all around the world are increasingly realizing that drug prohibition has failed to achieve its goals. Drug use rates have not declined and drugs are more available—and cheaper—than ever before. At the same time, the drug war has resulted in a long list of unintended consequences: militarization of law enforcement, the imprisonment of hundreds of thousands of non-violent people and more than 60,000 homicides in Mexico. AMERICA’S LONGEST WAR tells the stories of some of the countless victims of the drug war and points to a viable alternative approach to drug policy.
