Sober nations have all at once become desperate gamblers, and risked almost their existence upon the turn of a piece of paper.”- Charles Mackay, Extraordinary Popular Delusions And The Madness Of Crowds, 1841.
Economic bubbles are great examples of societies failing to learn from previous mistakes. Time and time again something comes along that seems too good to be true and it inevitably turns out that it is.A Brief History of Stock Market BubblesWhen Fundamental Analysis Fails“Everyone is following the economy, but I’m following the market.” – Joe Granville
There are those who invest successfully using only fundamental figures, and there those who successfully trade using only technical analysis. There are those who combine the two types of analyses and make money.
Nevertheless, I can see that many investors believe so much in fundamental analysis that they refuse to smooth their orders when caught on the wrong side of the market direction, because the fundamentals support the wrong side.When Fundamental Analysis FailsInvesting in Oil, Gas, Gold or SilverCommodities an be a vaulable addition to any investment portfolio.
