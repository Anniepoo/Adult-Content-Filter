New Games Launch Today!
Thursday, October 15th, 2015
from Kyle Gabler
Happy 7th birthday, World of Goo! Today, both of the 2DBOY’s (Kyle and Ron) have released new games! They feature wildly different styles and gameplay, and we hope players have as much fun with them as we’ve had building them.
Kyle has launched Human Resource Machine – a puzzle game where you program little office workers. Available today on Windows and Mac. Nintendo Wii U and tablet versions in a few weeks.
Ron has launched Subterfuge – an online multiplayer game that plays out in real-time over the course of about a week. Available today on iOS and Android.
And by sheer coincidence, our friends at Untame have launched their multiple award winning Mushroom 11 on the very same day. We had so much fun with it, we funded it via Indie Fund.
