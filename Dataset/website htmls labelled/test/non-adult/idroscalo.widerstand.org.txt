New delay with the vinyl version of Drumcorps's "Falling Forward"
Sunday, 20 December 2015 15:43
When it rains, it pours: we wrote extensively about the reasons behind the delay of the vinyl version of Drumcorps's new "Falling Forward" album (adn188) back in October, and explained how problematic it was for us. The pressing plant had back then promised to deliver us the record in the very first days of December.
This deadline came and went, and the records never reached us. Apparently, this time, there was not enough colored raw-vinyl for the production (whether or not it could have been pre-ordered is a question we would rather not ask at this moment). The consequence of this all is that records which we were originally expected in October were allegedly sent to us at the end of this week. Taking into account the usual delivery problems during the holiday season, we expect to receive them in Berlin either right before or right after Christmas, and be able to start sending orders right before New Years Eve.
We are extremely sorry for this new delay and are baffled by the amount of difficulties we are encountering on this LP. It is definitely worth it, but we have never encountered so many repeated delays on any production.
You can still pre-order Drumcorps's new LP (on blue & white vinyl, black & white one, or solid black) as well as purchase it immediately on CD or as digital files.Comments
Friday Freebie: listen to Swarm Intelligence's Skizze #01 set
Friday, 11 December 2015 00:00
Friday Freebie. First, sorry for the lack of update to this section of our website recently. We ran through some weird technical problems with the server that prevented us from adding new articles to this blog.
Anyway, let's come back with a loud and noisy bang: we sang the praise of the first party of Berlin's young Skizze crew when it took place (for example with this great trailer), and are happy to now get the chance to listen again to the whole set played by Swarm Intelligence's there. This raw recording of his show is here and below. Now let's see whether we also get to enjoy again what Ontal played right afterwards.

Friday Freebie: listen to Oyaarss playing at Riga's cathedral
Friday, 04 December 2015 17:54
Friday Freebie: Oyaarss just played a very particular concert on December 1s t. Invited to take part in an evening dedicated to church organs, this musician played a set of entirely new, group-oriented music in Latvia's biggest cathedral made almost entirely of samples from organs recorded at churches all across this country.
The whole show was recorded but apparently needs some additional mixing and post production to be enjoyable to people who did not attend this concert. However, below are almost 5 minutes from this set, prepared by Oyaarss for this week's Friday Freebie.
You can listen to this excerpt of Oyaarss's set here or below. You can also find pictures of this concert after the cut.

Friday Freebie: listen to new podcast by Swarm Intelligence
Friday, 06 November 2015 17:08
Friday Freebie: while "Rust" might still be very fresh (and gathering a lot of praises" at the moment), Swarm Intelligence's not getting any rest. He has just recorded a new podcast (he is quite generous with these) for the Berlin based Mindwaves collective. Starting quite calm and building up the noise and beat level little by little, this new mix showcases many sides of this artist's talent. A very nice companion to Swarm Intelligence's new album, it can also serve as an accurate introduction to people not yet familiar with this act (something they should correct quickly).
Click here or below to listen to Swarm Intelligence's "Mindcast 25". The tracklisting is after the cut.

out today: Drumcorps's "Falling Forward"
Friday, 30 October 2015 17:33
It will have taken 8 long years for Drumcorps to come up with a sequel to his remarked and remarkable "Grist" (adn70). That's almost 100 releases on Ad Noiseam, and many generations of fans (things go fast with underground music). But here it is (with an exception discussed here yesterday): Drumcorps's new album, "Falling Forward" is out today. The CD and digital versions are available immediately, and the LP is up for pre-order.
Few works have been as eagerly awaited as Drumcorps’ second album. Coming out nine years after "Grist" (Ad Noiseam adn70, 2006), "Falling Forward" looks to the future while staying true to the project's heavy guitar music roots. Dense riffs, vocals, melody, guest musicians, and a diverse array of modern electronics combine with concise songwriting to form a complete work of integrity. The result is powerful, cohesive, tender, and in a class of its own: keeping all the elements which made "Grist" a success and taking them forward, confirming Drumcorps’s position as not only a perfectionist, but also an innovator.

Drumcorps's new album: out tomorrow on CD, vinyl edition delayed.
Thursday, 29 October 2015 18:37
Tomorrow, October 30th is the release date of Drumcorps's long awaited new album. It took Aaron Spectre 8 years to craft this follow-up to “Grist”, we're very proud to be able to release “Falling Forward”, everything about this album should be a reason to rejoice.
We have bad news for some of you, though: we have learned that we will not be able to release the vinyl version of this album on time. Worse still, this LP is not being delayed by a couple of days or a week, but by six solid weeks. Yes, we now expect the vinyl edition of “Falling Forward” to be available on December 14th only. We are very disappointed and angry about this, and we would like to apologize to all of you who have pre-ordered this record and will have to wait.
Click below to read our rants about the reasons behind this delay and our annoyance with it. First thing first, though, here's a breakdown of what is happening for people who have ordered Drumcorps's new album:
if you have pre-ordered the CD, your order has been shipped already, or is being shipped this week. No change there.
if you have pre-ordered the digital version, you will be able to download it at midnight, Central European Time. No change there either.
if you have pre-ordered the vinyl version (in whatever color), your parcel will be sent only on or a bit before December 14th. We are very sorry for this. However, you will be able to download a digital version of this album from your store account page, free of charge, at midnight tonight. This applies only to paid orders, placed before today. If you want to change anything about your order (something which we would of course understand, considering the very long delay), please get in touch by writing an email to

.
if you pre-ordered the LP at the Maschinenfest, we have your snail mail address, but not your email one. Please get in touch so that we can send you this album's digital version.
And now for the longer rant...

Watch a video for Swarm Intelligence's "Iridescent"
Wednesday, 28 October 2015 18:34
Anybody listening to Swarm Intelligence's new "Rust" album and comparing it with its previous one, 2014's "Faction" will very quickly notice a sift towards somewhat more accoustic sounds, more organic soundscapes and away from purely electronic synthesis. This is something made very obvious by the brand new video for "Iridescent" which you can watched here or below. A year after their work for "Antenna" (taken from "Faction", the29nov team have come up with something very different this time again, reflecting well the partly humane, partly machine-like, but definitely rustier side of Swarm Intelligence's new album. The result is hypnotic, perfectly in sync with the music, and provides a great visual pendant to the track. Enjoy.

out today: Ontal's "Entropia" album.
Friday, 23 October 2015 15:34
We are proud to announce today the release of "Entropia", the first full length studio album by Ontal, a young but already very remarked duo from Serbia.
"Entropia" (adn190) is out today and available right now on CD and as digital files. You can get more information here and listen to the whole thing there.
From well-kept secret to one of the most praised names for dark, distorted techno, Ontal are already among the most talked about names for the genre. With "Entropia", this Serbian duo gets the chance to display its talent in a full-length format, offering very diverse material rich in heavy percussive beats, grating noise soundscapes and dynamic arrangements. Drawing inspirations from industrial forefathers as well as from modern producers, Ontal confirms with this album its position as one of the driving force when it comes to heavy, noisy and precise composition. Ever-changing but constantly powerful, "Entropia" is an industrial tour-de-force.
