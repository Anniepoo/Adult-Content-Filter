The Mortgage Bankers Association of Louisville is a local chapter of the Mortgage Bankers Association, the national association representing the real estate finance industry. We are comprised of bankers, brokers, loan officers and processors involved in the business of mortgage banking in the Louisville area.
The local chapter has a mission to promote the interest of those engaged in the business of lending money upon real estate and of those engaged in the business of buying and selling mortgages secured by real estate, and to better safeguard and protect the borrower on real estate and the investor in real estate securities. Additionally, the local chapter provides opportunities for certified continuing education at both regular luncheon meetings and training conferences and workshops.
The national association, headquartered in Washington, D.C., works to ensure the continued strength of the nation’s residential and commercial real estate markets; to expand homeownership prospects through increased affordability; and to extend access to affordable housing to all Americans. MBA promotes fair and ethical lending practices and fosters excellence and technical know-how among real estate finance professionals through a wide range of educational programs and technical publications. Its membership of approximately 2,600 companies includes all elements of real estate finance: mortgage companies, mortgage brokers, commercial banks, thrifts, life insurance companies, and others in the mortgage lending field. For additional information, visit the MBA website at www.mbaa.org.
