Letter to Bruce Springsteen, from South-West of France, Monday, October 19th, 2015
Hi Bruce !
I created this web site more than a decade ago.
It was supposed, at
first time, to be called : 'Letters to Bruce'...
But, than, I discovered that web domain name www.BruceSpingsteen.fr was available, so I thought it was more convenient to espect to join you one of this futur years because...
My first intention was to get the opportunity to try to communicate with you!
Than I thought, I was no more (and no less ;-) than one of you long time french fan (since The River) so I decided, to stay in the shadow, and oriented this site to informations about you in french language to the attention of your french fans (and some of them, like most of french people are so bad when come the time to speak and understand foreign language...). So I was usefull for the community.
Because, I discovered, by so many contacts I had with
them since (because of this site), that it was also a pleasure to be a part of and exchange with
this
unique community: Bruce Springsteen's fans.
I am 56 now, became a grand father a few months ago of my first grand son, and
what is his first name ?... Clarence ! (my daughter is a
big fan of you too).
So came
the third generation and I hope I will get time enough to show him one of your next concert !
When I first listen to The River album I was only 21 and I almost cannot believe that I jumped in that River since... 35 years. I was a young guy full of dreams (I had the chance to realized most of them) and became since one of your million fans.
It is always weird to try to define why you are a fan of a singer, a writer, a composer, a painter or any other kind of artist.
Some kind of strange alchimy (that define more or less what you are yourself) worked between you and this artist for some unkown reasons.
Since 1980, I had the pleasure to see so many of your concerts, from big place (Tunel of Love tour 1988)* to intimate Ghost Of Tom Joad Tour concerts and last Stade de France, Paris
in 2014. Took hundreds of photographs (hided camera and big lenses in my socks ;-)
So I wanted to thank you so much to be part of my life since these 35 years. You are some kind of Grand Brother, I have never had. Thanks for your music I listen so often, words and songs I appreciate so much, and most of all: generous ideas you carry and kind actions for so many people you had, which gave me good exemple and embody part of my life.

* : I was not abble to be one of those to see Born In The USA tour in La Counrneuve, France, my only brother got married the same day (God dawned brother!-).
