Hello World
My name is Nikita (Kitta) and I’m a Perth based geek girl. I’m currently the Managing Director (Boss Lady) of EnjoyPromotions and EnjoyPerth. I love events, event promotion and anything event related. If you live in Perth and love events too, I suggest you check us out. We’re pretty awesome. I’m also a self confessed high heel worshipper and Doctor Who fan that suffers from Multipletabitis. I tweet random thoughts as @kitta and in my spare time I enjoy blogging sporadically, gaming, volunteering and taking photos of the contents of the universe.
This website has been my online home for over ten years, a place where I could blog my thoughts and share other random sarcastic musings. I’ve taken a bit of a hiatus from blogging over the last few years, but I hope to return to my former passion one day. However, I am still quite active elsewhere online. If you would like to know more read my colophon or poke around my website and blog.
Over 4,382,235 users have visited my cyber home since July 18th 2002.
