Welcome
to the Indiana Mortgage Bankers Association (IMBA) Web Site!
Mission Statement
The mission of the Indiana Mortgage Bankers Association is to provide services, support, and information to its members, and to promote sound and ethical business practices consistent with industry standards.
History
In existence since March of 1958, the IMBA is the voice of the mortgage banking industry here in Indiana. Although closely affiliated with, and a member of, the national MBA, the state association works on an independent basis to improve and educate lenders in Indiana. Our mission statement includes providing services, support, and information to our members, and, to promote sound and ethical business practices consistent with industry standards.
Individual chapters began forming in July 1989 with the Greater Indianapolis Mortgage Bankers Association came into being. In April 1991, members in the Fort Wayne area formed the Northeast Chapter and this was soon followed by the Northwest Indiana Chapter, serving the Northwest Indiana Area. The South Central Chapter, which serves the Bloomington area, formed next and then, Michiana, which serves the South Bend metropolitan area in Northern Indiana. The most recent chapter to form is the Southwest Chapter, which serves industry members in the Evansville and surrounding areas.
Following the basic guidelines and bylaws of the IMBA, the chapters work closely with the state association in order to be a stronger and more unified voice, and, offer valuable and timely industry-related meetings as well as networking opportunities.
IMBA is also a proud to be a member of the national Mortgage Bankers Association!
