Digital Smoke - Developers of Solitaire City
Digital Smoke's latest masterpiece is called 10 Pin ShuffleTM which contains three great games in one for iPhoneTM, iPad and iPod® touch devices, played in a realistic 3D environment ...
(Now also available for Android phones and tablets and BlackBerry PlayBook and BB10 Smartphones)
Regular table Shuffleboard that you've enjoyed in the local bar. Play against a friend over Bluetooth® or Wi-Fi or a computer controlled opponent trying
to out-shuffle each other's weights or blast them off the table.
Shuffle Bowling which is very similar to regular Ten Pin Bowling except played on a Shuffleboard table with weights
instead of bowling balls. The impressive "Newton" 3D physics engine provides realistic pin collisions, just like Nintendo's® WiiTM Sports Bowling.
10 Pin Poker is a combination of Shuffleboard, Bowling and Five Card Draw Poker. Earn playing cards for Strikes and Spares.
Draw new cards when you have five. The player with the best five card poker hand after 10 frames wins.
Game Features
State of the art 3D graphics engine with reflections, shadows and realistic chrome Shuffleboard weights.
Real pin physics. Unlike many iPhone bowling games, 10 Pin Shuffle pins collide realistically with each other. Shuffleboard
weights tip off the edges of the table and roll down the gutters just like they do at the bar.
Play against a friend over Bluetooth® or Wi-Fi or one of several computer controlled opponents. Unlock new opponents of increasing skill levels.
Instant replays of great shots.
Realistic sound effects and crowd reactions. Listen to your iPod music library while you play.
Bowling game statistics are updated and saved each time you play.
Turkey rewards and winners animations.
Saves the game state when your iPhone is interrupted so you can continue playing where you left off next time you start the App.
