...helping you find the health and financial freedom you need to LIVE THE LIFE YOU WANT TO LIVE!
Bertha Pond and all of its wildlife are flourishing; we have truly created a wildlife refuge!  We have nesting Loons, with one to two babies hatched every spring.  We watch families of Canada geese, Mallards, and Wood ducks swim and thrive in our waters.  On our deck, we see a multitude of birds—Chickadees, Nuthatches, Cardinals, Goldfinches, Blue Jays, Titmice, Woodpeckers including Pileated, Red-headed, Red-bellied, Hairy, Downy, Yellow-bellied sapsuckers.  By mid-May, we can count on Ruby-throated hummingbirds, Baltimore orioles, and Red-breasted grosbeaks arriving.  We provide food for turkeys, deer, coyotes, bobcats, flying squirrels, and whatever stray dog or cat happens by.     How can we do this?  We are AbleAgain because Body Balance gives us solid health, and Life Force International gives us financial freedom.  Health     First and foremost, we have our health again.  After being diagnosed with Lupus, Mixed Connective Tissue Disease, and Ulcerative Colitis, to name only a few of the autoimmune illnesses that have plagued us for the last ten years, we discovered a healthy supplement that has given us relief!  Early in the fall of 2010 Roberta Kirn told us about Body Balance, and that has helped us to be AbleAgain!      Body Balance is a supplemental liquid made from Aloe Vera and nine different sea vegetables—a natural, cherry-citrus flavored drink that has up to a 98% absorption rate [nutrients in a pill form are only 10 to 20% absorbed] that goes directly into the blood stream and into cells within a matter of minutes.  This easy-to-swallow drink provides a broad-spectrum of nutritional supplements and antioxidants. One drink [instead of a handful of pills] and you're done!     Aloe Vera, black cherry, honey and an exclusive blend of 9 sea vegetables provide over 120 naturally occurring phytonutrients per ounce [74 minerals, 23 vitamins, 3 essential fatty acids, 21 amino acids, 7 enzymes, nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen].  See details here.Residual Income     We are AbleAgain because we are members of Life Force International.  With this helpful, residual income, you will have the money to support the activities you love, too.  Although we are not the type to take cruises or travel [why should we when we live in paradise?], there are plenty of Life Force members who do just that—in fact, several of them have multiple homes, take incredible vacations, and live in luxury.       This life can be yours, too, if you choose to become AbleAgain.  Check out Life Force International and order products at http://www.mylifeforce.net/20856488
