The Farm Credit Advantage
The Farm Credit Bank of Texas has been a leading source of credit and financial services for rural Americans for 98 years. Our long and successful history of financing agriculture and rural America is rooted in our cooperative structure and in other distinct business advantages:
We are owned by our customers; therefore, we operate in their best interests and share our earnings with them in the form of patronage. In 2014, we returned 69.4% of our net income to our customers.
We don't take deposits. Rather, we access the nation's money markets through the sale of AAA-rated Farm Credit bonds, which provides a reliable source of funding for rural Americans.
Our policies are set by our board members, who are Farm Credit customers elected by their fellow customers. This form of governance offers transparency to our owners and investors.
