Heavenly Creatures
by Toni
In the days before camp hobbits and wizards, Peter Jackson directed low budget horror films. Heavenly Creatures, originally released in 1994, was his first more mainstream effort. The film features the screen debuts of Melanie Lynskey and Kate Winslet. Lynskey, who for the record is a damn sight hotter now than she was then, plays the dark moody teen that no-one likes whilst Kate Winslet brings some pre-Titanic English class to this flick set in New Zealand.

Lesbian Sex Positions For Dummies
by Helen Childs
A girl's got to start somewhere hasn't she!? I'm sure we've all been in situations where we're left wondering what exactly the side-show contortionist we've hastily bedded is trying to achieve as she vaults across the room via the chandelier (what can I say, the décor at my house is a little pretentious!). Let's face it; it doesn't always quite go to plan. I for one have ended up in many an unladylike position, some of which have ended painfully; not a heartbroken sobbing wreck, but more like concertinaed into the splits and wedged between a wall and a bed. Believe me; nobody looks pretty from that angle! So, here are a few basics as a refresher for us all and as some handy (no pun intended) hints and tips for you lovely ladies who haven't given it a bash yet... So to speak.
Jump right in girls, the water's warm!

Lesbian Kisses - Top 10 Movie Kisses
by Toni
LoveGirls always strive to answer the most important issues in the gay community, forget Prop 8 and Gay Rights, this week we battled over what makes for a good onscreen girl on girl kiss.
We agonised for days over which movies should make the grade, okay maybe not days, but we spent a good few hours watching chicks make out.
It was painful, but we made it through to the other end, and here's the result of our research - "Top 10 Girl on Girl Movie kisses".

The Search For Miss Right
by Toni
I've never really had what could be described as a "type", when it comes to women I've dated a broad variety of them in the search for "Miss Right".
LITTLE MISS RELIGIOUS
In the beginning ...
She was a hardcore Catholic girl who went to church every week and looked like butter wouldn't melt in her mouth.
Determined not to let our religious differences, her 9pm curfew or her parents disapproving glares get in the way of true love we started dating.
What went wrong ...
I'm sure there are girls out there worth waking up for at 8am on a Sunday morning, but I quickly realised she wasn't one of them.
Whilst she was at Church praying for forgiveness for her sins, namely me, I was recovering from an alcohol fueled Saturday night out without her.

Where Is She Going Wrong?
by AnonyMoose
I have this friend who is basically a dating disaster, she is pretty, confident and funny, I bet she is sounding like a real catch, right?
I can't for the life of me work out where she is going wrong, but all her relationships seem to run a similar cycle.
Being the good friend that I am, I decided to catalogue the cycle in the desperate hope that maybe someone else can pin point whats going wrong with her relationships ...

Relationship Survival Lesson 1: Saying Sorry
by Toni
Leave a comment letting us know the last thing you had to apologise for or your tried and tested method of saying sorry and you could win an Ann Summers goody bag.
The longer a relationship lasts the more likely I am to screw up, so learning to say sorry has become a necessity. You dont need a degree in Advanced Mathematics to understand that an unhappy girlfriend = no sex.
Whether you're apologising for not noticing a new hair cut, forgetting an anniversary or getting so drunk at her sisters wedding that you ended up throwing up over her mum's favourite dress, what you say and do counts for a lot.

Proof Catwoman Isnt A Lesbian
by Toni
Some movies just dont deserve wasting a tub of Ben and Jerrys on. I was forced to watch the Catwoman movie last night with some friends and what followed was a lengthy drunken debate - "Is Catwoman a Lesbian?"
I argued on the lesbian side for two reasons;
Halle Berry is crazy hot in that movie
The world needs a Lesbian Superhero (with an oiled up body and revealing leather catsuit)
I was determined to convice the others that she was infact a closet dyke, a loosely held argument soley based upon the fact that we all wanted to do some nasty things to Halle Berry.
