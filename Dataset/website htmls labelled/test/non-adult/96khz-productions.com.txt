96kHz Productions
Created in Paris, the 96kHz sound derives from the early 90's underground dance scene. With influences from Trance, Techno, Drum & Bass, Hardcore and House, these genre's help form the sound that is 96kHz productions. Through this site, you will find producers which we believe, truly convey the idea of quality electronic music.
