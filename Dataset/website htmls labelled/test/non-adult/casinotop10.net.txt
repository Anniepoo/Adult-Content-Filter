When choosing a USA casino, select the one which suits you best in terms of available games, welcome bonuses, payment methods, payout percentages and also customer support.

What is a "wagering requirement" and how does it work?
A wagering requirement is the amount you need to bet in order to be able to withdraw your bonus winnings. This amount is set according to the bonus and wagering multiplier (this can be 20x, 30x, 50x or even higher) that the players has to 'wager' (in other words win/lose) in certain games set by the casino before the player’s account balance can be withdrawn.Example: Player's deposit was $100, the bonus was another $100 and the casino sets the wager at 30x only - $100 x 30 = $3000. Thus, the player has to win/lose $3000 to start withdrawing.
