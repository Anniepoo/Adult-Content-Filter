The quoted Yield Pledge® Checking interest rates and Annual Percentage Yields (APYs) are accurate as of 1/8/2016 12:00:00 AM. Since this is a tiered, variable rate account, the interest rates, APYs and tiers could change without notice. If your average daily balance is within a tier, the corresponding interest rate and APY is paid on your entire balance, except as described below for the Bonus Interest Rate offer. The current tiers and ongoing interest rates and APYs are: 0.61% APY/interest rate for balances of $100,000 and up; 0.56% APY/interest rate for $50,000 - $99,999.99; 0.46% APY/interest rate for $25,000 - $49,999.99; 0.41% APY/interest rate for $10,000 - $24,999.99; and 0.30% APY/interest rate for balances under $10,000. The required minimum opening deposit is $1,500. At this time, we are pleased to be offering a six-month Bonus Interest Rate and New Account First Year APY to first-time holders of our Yield Pledge Checking Account. Keep in mind the Bonus Interest Rate may not be applied to funds transferred from another EverBank® account. Fixed for the first six months, the Bonus Interest Rate (currently 1.60%) will apply to balances up to $100,000. Funds in excess of $100,000 will earn the variable ongoing APY and interest rate for our highest tier (currently 0.61%), which may change anytime - even during the first six months. The New Account First Year APY is a required disclosure that is a blended APY that combines the Bonus Interest Rate with the current ongoing interest rates. This isn't the exact APY you will earn since our current ongoing interest rates may change periodically over the last six months of your first year. The New Account First Year APYs are: 1.08% for $50,000 - $99,999.99; 1.03% for $25,000 - $49,999.99; 1.01% for $10,000 - $24,999.99; and 0.95% for balances under $10,000. The New Account First Year APY for balances from $100,000 to $10,000,000 is best expressed as a range: 1.11 to 0.62%; higher balances are accepted. Fees may reduce earnings.

Competitor APY information as of 1/7/2016 12:00:00 AM, provided by Market Rates Insight. Competitor APYs and terms and conditions can change at any time. Some competitor rates may vary by region.
