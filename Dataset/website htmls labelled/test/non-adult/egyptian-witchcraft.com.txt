Authentic Spell Casting Service and Spiritual Help
If you are in search for authentic, and true spiritual help, you have finally arrived at the right place.
My name is Aisha Al Haadi Rahman, and I have been casting successful love spells and magic spells professionally for 47 years. Egyptian-witchcraft.com has become the sole authority for magic spells ever since its 2001 official launch.
What makes my spells so potent and successful is the fact that all spells are 100% customized and personalized. Besides pictures and birth dates I also include your biological materials (such as your hairs, nails, tears, etc.) into your spell. The use of biological samples in love spells is mandatory and necessary. When your body is a part of the spell, you aren’t just an outsider to the process – you’re invested in the ritual: body, mind, and spirit.
This also explains my high success rate as I follow the true ancient Egyptian practices. Keep in mind that spells that do not include your biological materials will rarely work. Please do not waste your money on disingenuous offers, that claim powerful results by just submitting a payment to an unknown person along with a picture and a date of birth. Magic doesn’t work that way.
Magic is a process which you need to be invested in with your body, mind, and spirit. This is the only way for you to receive results from any witchcraft workings.
The same applies to Talismans. Once your spell has been completed by me, you will receive a charged Talisman via Fedex. My talismans are created during your customized ritual and are of utter importance to any love spells that actually work. The reason behind a Talisman is the fact that the true potency of a spell can only be released by the spell seeker, along with their own love, desire and wishes, into the universe. The first time you touch the Talisman you will release the energies of the spell into the universe and you can instantly feel the magic working for you and you will see how your results unfold in front of your very eyes.
This spirituel journey is not for everyone. Magic and Witchcraft is a process, not a push-button kind of miracle cure. If you are serious about your wish and your intentions are honest and true, I will be more than happy to help you.

How Magic can work for you
Life is full of hopes and aspirations but the circumstances might not always be conducive. One feels utterly helpless when confronted with situations that are impervious to one’s dearest wishes and heart-felt desires. Should you give up all hope and surrender to the forces that you surmise are beyond your control?
No! Because not all things that you think to be beyond your control, actually are. There are forces in the universe, which can be oriented to benefit you. You can experience these forces when you believe. A very simple example is you miss someone intensely and the person calls almost immediately. Is that just coincidence? Or, have you made the other person call by thinking so strongly about him/her.
How Love Spells Can Work for You
Love spells harness these extra-sensory forces to your advantage. There are energies in the universe that you might have encountered in fleeting moments, but are either not completely aware of, or, do not know how to orient them to your benefit. This is exactly what spells by a gifted spell caster like Aisha can do.
Powerful spells can bring back lost lovers and make the deepest desires of your heart come true. If you are deeply in love with someone and the other person does not respond; if you wish to make your spouse faithful to you; if you want to keep some other person off your loved one, love rituals are known to be effective. Alternately, if it is a matter of lust than heart, there are spells for that too. You can invoke the power of love magic in numerous unfavorable situations related to the matters of the heart, such as:

Love Spell to Return a Lost Lover
Make Someone Fall in Love
Remove Marriage Problems
True Love Spell
Break-up Spell

An authentic professional spell caster such as myself is the only key to the success with spells. The practitioner is the sole link between you, your lover and the forces of nature. I use my gifts to invoke the forces and make them act in your favor. Unlike voodoo or black magic, white magic has no occult practices and no negative effects. The acts are purely spiritual. The most important factors involved are my spiritual power and your positive energy.
Magic Spells
Magic spells on the other hand are effective in attracting success, security, luck, protection, beauty and well-being. I will customize a spell to fit your needs and desires. Here are some examples of the wide variety of spells I can cast for you.

Everything in the universe is connected. It is just that we are not trained to decipher the interlinking and decipher the processes. We all have evidenced strange, if not miraculous things, happen to others. They can happen to you even. However, these are only possibilities and the realization depends upon the proficiency of the practitioner. So if you are looking for help that you can rely on, look for a practitioner who has a history of making miracles happen, and one who has the gift.
Accept no Substitute – Aisha is the Answer!
White Magic Spells
There are many forms of white magic available for those who are having problems with their love life, but few are as effective or positive in nature as Egyptian Magic. This is because Egyptian Witchcraft is firmly rooted in the natural world, which makes it extremely effective for casting spells regarding what is the most natural of emotions – love!
The Ancient Power of Witchcraft Spells
My spells are thousands of years old, going back in time to ancient Egypt, the reign of the great Pharaohs and beyond. Sometimes called Heka, after the Egyptian God of magic, this powerful magic has been called upon for generations. Cleopatra herself has used some of these potent witchcraft spells to bring men like Caesar and Mark Anthony to their knees in devotion to her.
I call on the power of Egyptian deities to intensify the natural core of attraction and love found in each of us. We spell casters who cast these love spells call on the Egyptian deities and Heka in particular by using special incantations and rituals using natural herbs, minerals, biological materials and other aspects of the natural world along with strong talismans to enhance and direct the spells.
Practical Magic and Casting Spells
Deities, or spirits, such as Isis, Horus, Amun Ra and Osiris can be called on even today. They will gladly intercede on my behalf when called upon by a proper spell casting.  Because these deities acknowledge the veneration and tribute of me calling on them, they are eager to grant the wishes of those who seek my help.
Egyptian magic also understands the power of the written word.  In the earliest times, magic spells were written down in ancient Egypt in the form of hieroglyphics which could then be read out loud while casting a spell, adding the powerful magic of the written word to the power of incantation, which is one of the reasons why I require either handwritten letters or wish lists. All my love spells will be written down, and then consumed by fire after the casting of the spell is complete.
Egyptian Magic Love Spells Respect the Natural Order
Spell casters who perform Egyptian magic love spells exalt the natural world, just as ancient Egyptian priests and priestesses did thousands of years ago. The power of nature imbues the spells with a natural force strong enough to soften even the most hardened of hearts. Whether you want the return of a lost love or you desire to enrich your own natural attraction (that powerful force that resides in all of us, waiting to be enhanced through the proper spells), spells can help!
If your greatest desire is to influence the one you love and gain control of your love life, but you don’t want to call on the dark arts, voodoo or black magic, then Egyptian magic spells are right for you. Their close connection to the natural world and reliance on the loving intervention of the spirits of Heka will guarantee that all will be well without upsetting the natural order of things.
Ancient Egyptian magic has fascinated the young and old since its discovery.  With its focus on rituals and symbols, it’s not difficult to see why people are drawn to Heka.  Heka is the word associated specifically with the magic of Ancient Egypt, but the definition is far more complex than the word itself.
What is Ancient Egyptian Magic?
Heka is the force which was there at the beginning of time. This creative force came from the gods and helped to create the universe and all of the elements within it. Some have also said that Heka was the first manifestation of the God Ra, often regarded to be his soul, or his first visible appearance (sometimes referred to as Ba).
Opposites and the Same
Heka is also a power which is indefinable unless experienced.  This strong energy has been around since the beginning of time and it will continue to be present as the days pass, the months pass, and the years pass.  Heka is an ancient Egyptian magic, but it is also the action of the magic, the steps one might take in order to harness the power of magic for personal or community use.
God and Goddess
While Heka is often associated with male deity, adding a ‘t’ to the end of it allows it to also be of the feminine energy as well.  Associated with Isis and with Sekhmet, Heka is the power which can change, destroy, create, and alter.  But some say that Heka is the ancient magic that has been passed on to humans in order for us to use.  By allowing humans the opportunity to shift their energy, drawing on the wisdom of the Gods, we can change our world and all that is in it.
And that’s the reason why I am here to help you.
