Caroline Crowther – Helping you meet someone new in your area
The Caroline Crowther Introduction Agency based in the Bristol and Bath area and covering the whole of Western, Central and Southern England as well as South Wales. We have an enviable reputation for bringing people together. We have been established for over 20 years and feel we know how this is a personal and specialised service. We take time to guide you along the whole process of meeting and dating clients and above all take time to listen. It is understandably a sensitive and what can be a traumatic process of meeting people and will guide you step by step. We will take on clients from further afield as long as they are prepared to travel.  We help our members to meet new people, develop friendships and find new partners.
Professional – Personal
Most of our members are 40 years or older and come from professional backgrounds.  There is no upper age limit and we have many members in their 70′s and 80s!
Perhaps our best endorsement is that many of our members have joined as a result of personal recommendations by former members who have formed successful relationship and long lasting happiness as a result of the service that we provide.
