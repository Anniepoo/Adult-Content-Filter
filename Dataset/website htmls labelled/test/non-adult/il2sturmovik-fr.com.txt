Key Features
FROM PREY TO PREDATORYou will play as Takkar, a seasoned hunter and the last surviving member of your group. You have one goal: survival in a world where you are the prey.
• Grow your tribe and hone your skills to lead your people.
• Encounter a cast of memorable characters who can help push back the dangers of the wild.
• Face enemy tribes who will do anything to eradicate you and your allies.
• Defeat predators and humans, and rise to become the apex predator.
STONE AGE BY FAR CRYThis isn’t the Stone Age you thought you knew. This is the Stone Age with irreverence and mayhem. This is the Stone Age by Far Cry.
• Stalk enemy outposts and plan your attack using weapons and tools crafted from the bones of beasts you’ve killed.
• Master fire to expand your tactical options, setting your weapon on fire or scaring predators at night.
• Land the killing blow on the prey you've chased across the plains. But beware, its scent may attract predators willing to fight you for the prize.
• The rich setting of the Stone Age only multiplies the amount of deadly weapons, dangerous threats, and incredible stories that Far Cry is known for.
A WORLD RULED BY GIANT BEASTSAfter the last Ice Age, the glaciers retreated to leave behind a land blooming with nature and resources where humans and animals alike can thrive – provided they have what it takes to prove their dominance.
• Discover the majestic and savage land of Oros with its breathtaking valley of redwood forests, harsh taiga, and humid swamps where you can see Earth as it was before man laid claim to it.
• Oros teems with life from large herds of deer and vicious packs of dire-wolves to warring enemy tribes. It is ruled by megafauna such as sabretooth tigers and woolly mammoths, giant animals that dominated the Earth in the Stone Age and were feared by every other living being.
