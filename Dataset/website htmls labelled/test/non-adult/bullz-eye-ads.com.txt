Oracle and BlueKai
On February 24, 2014 Oracle announced that it signed an agreement to acquire BlueKai to extend the world's largest Marketing Cloud with the leading Data Management Platform to personalize marketing programs and customer experience.
The transaction has closed.
BlueKai is the industry's leading cloud-based big data platform that enables companies to personalize online, offline and mobile marketing campaigns with richer and more actionable information about targeted audiences. BlueKai's Data Management Platform (DMP) centrally organizes a company's customer and audience data in the cloud to help implement personalized marketing campaigns across all channels and deliver better results and higher marketing ROI. BlueKai also runs the world's largest 3rd party data marketplace to augment a customer's proprietary data with actionable information on more than 700 million profiles. Approximately 300 customers across multiple industries rely on BlueKai to maximize their marketing investment.
The Oracle Marketing Cloud is an integral part of the Oracle Customer Experience Cloud which includes commerce, sales, service, social and marketing. Together, the Oracle Customer Experience Cloud enables a seamless and integrated exceptional customer experience from the first touch point through the entire customer lifecycle.
The BlueKai team brings significant knowledge and capabilities to Oracle and is expected to continue facilitating excellence in data-driven marketing at Oracle.
