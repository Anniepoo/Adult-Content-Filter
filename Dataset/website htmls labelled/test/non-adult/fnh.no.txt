New VISA Chip Cards:  Thank you for bringing to The First National Bank of Trentons attention the problems you are continuing to experience with your new VISA Chip Debit Cards.  We are being told that our card processor and VISA are working diligently to resolve the problem.  We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this is causing you.  Test cards were successfully used for several weeks before your cards were issued to you.  We had no reason to expect a problem like this.  The VISA Chip Debit Cards are working at ATMs and are working with a PIN during this time.  We also understand internet and phone transactions are being denied during this time.  You may continue to use your old strip card during this time while this issue is being resolved.  Once again, The First National Bank of Trenton sincerely apologizes for the inconvenience this is causing you.  We appreciate your patience.
